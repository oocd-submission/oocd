madrid barcelona extended their winning start to their title###defence to six games when neymar scored his debut la###liga goal and lionel###messi netted his seventh of the season in an entertaining 4 1 victory at home to real###sociedad on tuesday . while barca fans were treated to some breathtaking skill at the nou camp on the 56th anniversary of the inauguration of europe 's biggest###stadium , atletico###madrid gave another indication they may be challenging for the title come the end of the campaign with their sixth win in six matches . diego###costa struck twice in a 2 1 win at home to osasuna to match messi on seven for the season as atletico joined barca on a maximum 18 points , five ahead of real###madrid , who play at promoted elche on wednesday . sociedad , who like barca , real and atletico are competing in this term 's champions###league , made the livelier start as they set about chasing their first league win at the nou camp in more than 20 years . their last victory there in may , a 3 1 success which came when barca had already been crowned###champions , was thanks to two goals from john###aldridge and one from dalian###atkinson . haris seferovic cracked a shot against the crossbar in the second minute of tuesday 's game but the home side were ahead three minutes later when neymar , recruited from santos in the close season , bundled over the line after some indecision in the sociedad defence . world player of the year messi made it 2 0 with a diving header from the brazilian 's cross three minutes later and sergio###busquets scored a rare goal to make it 3 0 in the 23rd minute . the barca players appeared determined to put on a show after failing to convince in some of their games under new coach gerardo###martino and showcased some of the rapid passing that has characterised their play in recent###years . one move towards the end of the first half was like a kick around on the beach with xavi , andres iniesta , messi and neymar tearing the sociedad defence apart before messi miscued neymar 's centre and the danger passed . they lost some of their intensity in the second half and alberto de la###bella pulled one back for the visitors just after the hour . messi , who squandered several chances , set up substitute marc bartra to score from close###range 13 minutes from time and snuff out any hopes of a sociedad fightback . i am very happy with my first goal in la###liga but the most important###thing was the victory , neymar said in a pitchside interview with spanish television###broadcaster canal plus . we are playing well , each day better , added the 21 year old , whose assist for messi was his third for the argentine in the league this season . martino has been alternately resting some of his key players in the early###stages of the season and messi , who almost always plays a full match , was replaced with 10 minutes left . he looked less than pleased with the decision but later posted a message on his facebook###page explaining that although he does n't like to be substituted it 's best for the team . atletico coach diego###simeone has transformed the team since taking over at the end of 2011 and their success this season has in large measure been down to costa 's excellent###form . the combative brazilian opened the scoring in the 18th minute at the calderon , sidefooting juanfran 's cross past osasuna goalkeeper andres fernandez , and made it 2 0 seven minutes later with a powerful###header from koke 's centre . oriol riera stole in to volley past thibaut###courtois shortly before halftime but atletico comfortably held on to their lead to secure a morale boosting win ahead of saturday 's derby at real 's bernabeu stadium . in tuesday 's other games , malaga won 2 0 at home to promoted almeria to climb to seventh on eight points and levante drew 1 1 against visiting real###valladolid .

glendale , ariz . the arizona###cardinals have reached a contract agreement with first###round###draft###pick jonathan cooper . the four year deal is worth about . 5 million , the maximum allowed under the nfl collective###bargaining###agreement for cooper as the seventh pick overall . the 6 foot , 311 pound guard from north###carolina missed the first two days of training###camp , when the team worked out in shorts . he was en###route to arizona and also missed sunday 's practice , the team 's first in pads . he was expected to practice monday . cooper had worked out at left guard with the starting unit through the offseason . the agreement leaves two first round###picks unsigned cornerback dee milliner of the new york jets ( ninth pick overall ) and guard chance warmack of the tennessee###titans ( 10th . arizona coach bruce###arians got word of the contract agreement when a note was passed to him during his daily briefing with reporters on sunday . just got word that jonathan cooper is done and is on his way , arians said . he still missed time , but i 'm a lot happier now . we 're excited to have him in and watch him run the conditioning test in front of the whole team . although cooper did miss a bit of training###camp , his offseason work leaves him familiar with what 's expected of him . he got a zillion reps , arians said . he joins an offensive###unit that was called out for poor###play by its coach on sunday . that 's the disappointing thing to me right now , arians said . it 's not like our guys did n't have plenty of reps , because we had two practices going on during all of otas . there 's no excuses right now for making the mental errors that we 're making on offense . the coach has declared competition for the two starting tackle jobs levi brown and nate potter on the left side , newcomer eric winston and bobby massie on the right . daryn colledge has moved from left to right guard with lyle sendlein at center . i 'm very disappointed right now with the play up front , he said . way too many mental errors . the physical part we 'll###start seeing this afternoon . we 've got to get better . i think that they 've got enough pride that they 're going to fix it . i think they 're anxious to get pads on . of all the people that get hurt playing in shorts , it 's the big guys . cooper , a first team associated press all american , started a school record 48 games at left guard for north###carolina and earned the 2012 jacobs###blocking###trophy as the best lineman in the sec . he is the first guard taken in the top eight of the draft since , when mike###munchak was selected by the houston oilers as the eighth overall pick . in a draft loaded with players up front , cooper was the fifth lineman selected . in the end , the cardinals did not have to set any precedent after the two sides wrangled over some contract language technicalities , general###manager steve keim said . and , keim said , the team already is impressed with cooper , as a player and a person , simply by the way he worked through the summer . indications that you get from rookies most of the time can have variances , from good to bad , keim said . early###indications on jonathan cooper through otas and minicamp so far have been outstanding , almost to the point i would say better than advertised .
sports are precise straight as foul###lines or finish lines , each basepath measured exactly , every game interval spaced evenly as chalk lines on the gridiron . there are clocks and timekeepers , and rule books and officials ready to enforce them . fanhood is not a straight###line . it has broken field moves . it is a great , winding thing , fanhood is , played on the fly , and if you can follow it in cleveland home of the browns and the crooked###river and unceasing heartbreak through its many twists and turns , then you can follow it anywhere . even to the hereafter . i do not know if an obituary can go viral , but the one for the late scott e . entsminger , of mansfield , ohio , comes close . a lifelong cleveland###browns fan and season###ticket###holder , said the notice of his july 4 passing in the columbus###dispatch , he also wrote a song each year and sent it to the cleveland###browns as well as offering other advice on how to run the team . he respectfully requests six cleveland###browns pallbearers so the browns can let him down one last time . and just like that , entsminger 's parting shot became another chapter in the big book of cleveland unrequited###love . mine is a story about requited love . it is a story of small ohio towns and panzer units . the story wanders in the ardennes forest before coming to rest on a sofa in american suburbia , and in between there are blacksmiths and trees , lots of trees , and snow . otto###graham and field###marshal gerd###von###rundstedt make cameos . it ends with an obituary . but it begins at the dinner###table . sunday dinners with my grandmother gemma colino meant roasts and pasta and sheet pizzas as wide as a church window . i grew up in the jim###brown '60s , but knew all about the glory###days of the 1950s browns . my aunts' favorite###player was dante lavelli . i knew from listening that dante came from hudson , ohio , to gallop across the all###america###football###conference and the n.f.l. , twisting and turning and frustrating defensive###backs for a decade . i knew that in a sport of crazylegs and galloping ghosts he was gluefingers lavelli because of his sure hands . i half expected him to show up when my grandmother made braciola . he was inducted into the pro###football###hall###of###fame in . a lifetime later i was working a night job i hated do n't ask how i got there making my way through the suburban###traffic . lavelli 's read the sign on a furniture store , and because i am a fearless individual it took years for me to gather the pluck to enter that showroom . you looking for dan ? the man at the door asked , and there he was , a little grayer but still a block of granite . dante tried to sell me a settee , then offered me a seat on a sofa to talk football . he told me his father was a blacksmith who made horseshoes and then moved on to ornamental wrought###iron when tractors came in . dante went to ohio###state to play for paul###brown , but life began one of its scrambles . world###war###ii was raging , so he and another buckeye named lou###groza enlisted , intending to serve together . groza wound up in the pacific dante splashed ashore at normandy a week after d day . someone asked an officer what our orders were , and he pointed and said 'berlin 's that way . start walking , ' dante told me with a grin . christmas 1944 found him in a town called st . vith , the german artillery pounding the belgian woods to splinters around him . this was the nazi counterattack known as the battle of the bulge , and hell seemed to freeze over . christmas 1946 found dante catching the winning###touchdown from graham to beat the new york yankees in yankee###stadium . improbable bookends , i told him , but dante just shrugged . life turns and sprints away , and what could you do but follow ? i told him i was a little wary of the shiny new browns stadium , maybe because it was celebrated so wildly that it got turned into sacred###ground long before much grass got trampled . there was something merrily decrepit about the old municipal###stadium where those great browns teams###played , all rivets and rust , not least because it fit so perfectly into the iron city around it . dante , who knew more about iron than i ever would , pointed out the industrial washing###machines . really nice , dante said . things###change , he said , then asked how come you could n't find a suitable plate of spaghetti and meatballs in this town . over three years we shared a half###dozen encounters . the last time we spoke , by phone , dante was nursing a broken###leg he had slipped on the winter ice outside his store . there was a stack of interview requests on his desk and wonder in his voice he had become more known to historians and reunion organizers for surviving the battle of the bulge than for any of his football accomplishments . each evening on the way to work i passed the carmine colored cadillac with the mr . glue plates , and all was right with the world . then , one day in , his car was gone . i 'm glad i got to meet dante but sad that i never made scott entsminger 's acquaintance . the newspapers mentioned that entsminger had retired after 32 years at general###motors we are both time clock punchers and would have had that much as a start . we would have music . according to his obituary , entsminger played###guitar as i once did or better , hopefully ( my own musical career began with a half###hour rendition of louie , louie at cleveland 's franklin###street y one teenage night , and pretty much ended right there , too . ) and eventually we would get around to the 350 pound lineman in the room . how you think the browns will do ? one of us would ask , and throats would be cleared . scott entsminger was laid to rest on a hot july morning . the browns did not dispatch any pallbearers not even a punter but they did spring for a team jersey . you embrace fandom as a blessing or you bear it as a burden . but first you have to catch it . even if it takes until the hereafter .
san###diego if doctors took away his cellphone in the days immediately after broncos coach###john###fox had heart surgery , they surely must have demanded that he give up control of the television remote sunday as he sat at home watching the broncos' 28 20 victory over the san###diego###chargers . what had looked like another dynamic performance and a get well card to their recuperating coach devolved into a victory that raised###questions , along with the ghosts of last january , about whether the broncos are built to endure in the playoffs and what kind of shape quarterback peyton###manning will be when they get there . the broncos squandered most of a commanding lead and watched manning , after being battered by the chargers , hobble off the field on already gimpy ankles . he will have a magnetic###resonance###imaging test monday . even a late stand by the defense and the offense 's running out the clock could not be fully enjoyed . sandwiched in between , the broncos had to survive trindon###holliday 's fumbling a punt inside denver 's 20 yard###line . it surely made for some uneasy viewing for fox , who had planned to watch the game at his off season home in charlotte , n.c . he is expected to be gone from the team for as long as 10 weeks . earlier sunday , fox sent texts to many of the players , and on saturday he spoke with manning before the team left denver . i told him not to be yelling at me during the game , manning said . it 's not good for his blood###pressure . the absence of fox , who was awarded a game ball , comes at a critical time for the broncos . they had breezed through the first half of their schedule , with only two games closer than 16 points a loss to indianapolis and a comeback win over dallas . but after the victory over the chargers , the broncos have two games with unbeaten kansas###city , their division rival , and make a trip to new england . the next three weeks should go a long way in determining who wins the a.f.c . west and who has home###field###advantage through the playoffs . what kind of shape manning will be in is an open###question . the bye last week had given his two sprained ankles a chance to recover , but he was sacked twice and hit four other times sunday . the final one came late in the game when manning delivered a perfectly timed second and 7 pass to demaryius###thomas for 9 yards that effectively###ended the chargers' hopes . but manning was tackled around the ankles by defensive###end cory liuget . there were lumps in many throats from the broncos' sideline all the way to charlotte . it 's the worst when your quarterback goes down , your leader , said thomas , who caught two touchdown passes . it scared me a little bit . if manning emerged sore , it did not damage his sense###of###humor . he said , 4.4 or . 5 , it wo n't make much of a difference , referring to a 40 yard###dash time far faster than he would run . asked if he expects the ankle problems to linger , manning said i hope not . i 'd like to be able to shake it . it 's felt good these last few weeks , but obviously we 've got a lot of football left . while the culture of an n.f.l . locker###room has become a national###news story out of miami , locker###room leadership is being tested in denver and houston , where the head###coaches , fox and gary###kubiak , have taken leaves for health reasons . with their absences , more responsibility falls not only on the interim coaches , but also on the teams' veteran leaders . fox was playing###golf nine days###ago near his home in charlotte during the broncos' bye###week when he experienced dizziness . two days later , he had surgery to replace a heart###valve . he was released from the hospital friday . standing in for fox is jack###del###rio , who in nine years as jacksonville 's coach had to face manning twice each season . while del###rio , the defensive###coordinator , now has to oversee the entire team , there was probably little to weigh in on with an offense that is on pace to set n.f.l . records for scoring and total###offense . but he did speak up when the defense forced a punt that holliday fumbled and recovered at his 19 yard###line . del###rio told the offensive###coordinator , adam###gase , to do whatever he needed to win the game . that meant putting the ball in manning 's hands something that fox and the former offensive###coordinator mike###mccoy , now the charger coach , did not do in their overtime playoff###loss to baltimore last season . manning finished 25 of 36 for 330 yards and 4 touchdowns , and he eclipsed , 000 yards and 30 touchdowns in a season for the eighth time , one behind the record###holder , brett###favre . but the defense struggled to get off the field , allowing san###diego to hold the ball for more than 38 minutes . the offense did not score over the final 26 minutes , and manning lost a fumble that jump started a chargers comeback . that the broncos' 28 points was a season low was quite a feat , given that they have a 37 year old quarterback who is one year removed from missing a season after neck surgery . there are many teams that would trade their troubles for the broncos' , but if these problems are not solved in the coming###weeks , their coach may have company on the couch .
( reuters ) shakhtar###donetsk have signed attacking###midfielder bernard , one of brazil 's mostly highly###rated young###players , for 25 million###euros . 5 million ) from atletico mineiro , the ukrainian club said on thursday . the 20 year old helped atletico mineiro win the libertadores###cup last month and was part of the brazil squad which won the confederations###cup in june , making two substitute appearances . he is the 11th brazilian member of the shakhtar squad , who have won the ukrainian###premier###league for the last four seasons . atletico accepted shakhtar 's offer last week but bernard , who was reportedly being chased by arsenal , tottenham###hotspur and porto , was hesitant about the move , according to brazilian media . he left for ukraine earlier this week saying only that he wanted to look at the club 's facilities . shakhtar said on their website ( www . shakhtar . com ) that bernard had been allowed to chose his shirt###number and opted for , considered the most prestigious by brazilian players . he has signed a five year contract . bernard , who is only 164 centimetres tall , was twice axed from atletico mineiro 's youth###divisions because he was considered too lightweight . in , bernard , full name bernard alicio caldeira duarte , was loaned to third division democrata where he scored 14 goals in 16 games before returning to atletico mineiro . he has thrived since cuca took over as coach of the belo###horizonte side two years###ago . bernard scored on his last appearance for atletico mineiro one week ago but , having already been booked , was sent off for taking his shirt off as he celebrated . shakhtar , who have qualified###automatically for the champions###league###group###stage , are rebuilding their squad after selling brazilian playmaker willian to anzhi###makhachkala in february and his compatriot fernandinho to manchester###city last month . the club also sold armeniaa attacking###midfielder henrikh###mkhitaryan to champions###league runners up borussia###dortmund last month but signed facundo ferreyra from argentina 's velez sarsfield for 9 million###euros .
a quarter century ago , the n.c.a.a . announced unprecedented penalties for southern###methodist###university after it found that players had been paid from a slush###fund , invoking the so called death###penalty by suspending the football program for the 1987 season . amid the turmoil , david r . mccormack , an alumnus and a lawyer , sued the n.c.a.a . in federal court on behalf of southern###methodist 's graduates , its students , and several players and cheerleaders , accusing the n.c.a.a . of breaking federal antitrust laws . the class###action###suit charged the n.c.a.a . with , among other things , imposing penalties unequally and without due process . the mccormack case , ultimately###rejected by an appeals###court , is one of several lawsuits against the n.c.a.a . now being recalled after gov . tom###corbett of pennsylvania announced wednesday that he was suing the organization on behalf of the state . corbett is alleging that the n.c.a.a . committed antitrust violations through the penalties it levied on penn###state after the child###sexual###abuse scandal involving the former assistant football###coach jerry###sandusky . robert m . roller , a lawyer in texas who represented the n.c.a.a . in the mccormack case , said in an interview that the case felt significant at the time . i thought it was an important case , especially on the antitrust issues , said roller , now semiretired . he said it was also important because of the severity of the sanctions . in hindsight , it ended football there for a while , he said . the mccormack case had trouble gaining###traction , though . in , an appeals###court dismissed the lawsuit , agreeing with a lower court 's decision that some of the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the suit . s.m.u. , like penn###state now , was not a party to the case . among mccormack 's assertions were that football players' careers were ruined , that the university experience was harmed and that cheerleaders experienced###considerable emotional anguish and distress by not being able to cheer at games . mccormack , who is now dead , sought tens###of###millions of dollars in damages from the n.c.a.a . as the case was dismissed , judge alvin b . rubin wrote that he gave the loyal students and alumni credit for making a college try . legal###experts said thursday that the case shows how difficult it can be to beat the n.c.a.a . in court , something other antitrust cases filed against the organization have also demonstrated . corbett is expected to face a tough task litigating his claims that the n.c.a.a . was overreaching and unlawful in how it punished penn###state and its football program and harmed pennsylvania residents in the process . penn###state was fined 60 million , among other penalties , and the football###team was given a four year postseason###ban and significant scholarship reductions . but corbett is likely to have better footing for his case than mccormack did , legal###experts said . the mccormack and corbett cases have basic similarities each involved a third party suing the n.c.a.a . and alleging antitrust violations after the organization issued steep penalties against a successful football program . but a key###difference is that it should be easier for corbett , a governor , to establish he can bring a case on behalf of those he claims the n.c.a.a . has hurt . i think it would be difficult to argue that corbett does not have standing to file here , said timothy epstein , an expert in sports###law , noting that corbett was also a member of the university 's board of trustees . penn###state agreed to the n.c.a.a . penalties when they were handed down in july . corbett initiated his case on the basis that he could , through his office , represent the interests of the people of the state . in the suit , he called the penn###state football program an important economic###engine supporting pennsylvanians across the commonwealth , saying that it generated more than 50 million a year . he said the n.c.a.a . 's actions hurt the football program , the people who relied on it for work , ticket###sales , state revenue and students who decided to attend penn###state in part because of the team . the mccormack case also differed in that it included football players as plaintiffs . the appeals###court ruling addressed the claims of football players separately , but it ultimately###dismissed them , too . david blewett , a former s.m.u . football###player , said that he remembered hearing about the case at the time but that he never took it seriously and was not contacted about getting involved . if i could go back in time , i might have signed onto it so i could see what could have happened , said blewett , who recently wrote a book about his experiences at s.m.u . the s.m.u . players never had their day in court after we got the death###penalty .

chicago the top candidate for the rangers' coaching vacancy , alain###vigneault , met with general###manager glen###sather and the club 's management staff monday in la###quinta , calif . vigneault coached the vancouver###canucks for seven seasons until he was fired last month after the canucks were eliminated in the first round by the san###jose###sharks . vigneault led the team to six division titles and the 2011 stanley###cup###finals . the rangers have also received###permission to interview lindy###ruff , who was fired as the buffalo coach this season , his 15th behind the sabres' bench . the rangers' interest in vigneault and ruff was confirmed by a person close to the situation but not authorized to speak###publicly . mark###messier , the former rangers captain and a special###assistant to sather since , is also considered a candidate for the coaching###job . sather fired john###tortorella after the rangers were eliminated by the boston###bruins in the second round of the playoffs last month . sather , 69 , said he would continue as the rangers' general###manager next season , but he is expected to be succeeded as soon as the next season by one of his two assistant general###managers jim###schoenfeld or jeff gorton . gorton ran the rangers while sather was hospitalized after prostate surgery in march . as the interim###general###manager of the bruins for four months in , gorton acquired tuukka###rask , signed zdeno chara and drafted milan###lucic and brad###marchand , all key###figures on boston 's team entering the stanley###cup###finals wednesday . i thought they did a real good job , bruins general###manager peter chiarelli said tuesday of what gorton and the bruins' staff did in .
nearly 40 years###ago the brothers paolo###and###vittorio###taviani wrote and directed allonsanfan , starring marcello###mastroianni as a revolutionary in the napoleonic###era . after its premiere at the cannes###film###festival mr . mastroianni met with reporters , and when they asked him about the unusual experience of working with two directors on the same film , he feigned surprise . were they two ? he asked . the tavianis are now in their 80s , but at an age when most of their contemporaries have retired they continue making###films , and in seamless unity . their latest###effort , caesar must die , which opens on wednesday , is one of their most artistically ambitious productions a fictional feature with elements of a documentary and the theater , about the staging of shakespeare 's julius###caesar in a maximum###security###prison in rome . what kind of film is this ? vittorio taviani , 83 , asked rhetorically during an interview last fall , when caesar must die was shown at the new york film###festival . it 's a true film , a fiction film in which the reality of the prison is physically palpable . paolo taviani , 81 , completed the thought the energy of this film is born of pain , you see the walls and the bars before you , the authentic pain of the people living###inside the prison . the tavianis , who have written or directed 22 films together , are not the only pair of siblings making###films together of course . in europe there are also the dardenne###brothers of belgium , while the united###states has the coens , the wachowskis , the farrellys and the hugheses . but the tavianis have been doing it longer than anyone else since 1954 and have developed a working method that minimizes friction by alternating the direction of individual scenes . the crew that knows us asks , 'who 's the first today ? ' paolo explained . and while that person is at the helm the crew has to answer only to the director in charge at that moment . they ca n't go ask paolo something they want to do . when it 's finished , i come and look at the video . vittorio continued the other is at the monitor , watching the video . we have a very acute nonverbal , telepathic communication . if the one at the monitor starts to scratch his head , the other understands . so we have a silent meeting , we correct it , and then we go off again . writing###scripts works in much the same fashion . they live within walking###distance of each other in rome , so they will often meet at a park and discuss whatever their current###project happens to be while walking their dogs together and then go to one or the other 's house and get down to work , seated across from each other at a table . for caesar must die the brothers brought in a collaborator , fabio cavalli , to help distill and shape the shakespearean text into a screenplay . in a bit of meta playfulness mr . cavalli , who directs a theater###troupe at rebibbia prison in rome , was cast as the director of the play within the movie . the themes of guilt and friendship , betrayal and conspiracy are at the center of shakespeare 's play , and also at the center of the life experience of the actors , many of whom are serving terms for mafia or camorra related###crimes , mr . cavalli said . so many actors and directors had come to rebibbia , he continued , but until the tavianis came along , nobody understood that here was an opportunity to make a movie about this extraordinary environment so full of art , the hope of freedom , and consciousness . caesar must die was born when a journalist friend of the tavianis urged them to visit a performance by the rebibbia troupe . they were reluctant at first . we thought , oh , it 's going to be the same old thing , paolo said . but once they saw the prisoners performing dante and pirandello , they changed their minds . we immediately had this sense that this was a great###idea come down to us from the heavens , vittorio said . these compatriots of ours are tragic figures , really . they know crime and conspiracy , so let 's let them tell the tragedy of julius###caesar and mark###antony , which is an italian story , a roman story that 's part of the collective imagination of the italian people . the tavianis have a long history of adapting works from the western literary###canon . since releasing the semi###autobiographical the night of the shooting###stars , an international hit 30 years###ago , they have twice made films drawing from pirandello ( kaos and you laugh ) and tolstoy ( night sun and resurrection ) and also adapted goethe 's elective###affinities for the screen . in addition they made a mini###series for italian television , luisa###sanfelice , based on a novel by alexandre###dumas . they are very literary sort of intellectuals , but not university type intellectuals , said peter bondanella , an emeritus###professor at indiana###university and author of italian cinema from neorealism to the present . they have this background that was typical of their time , but is n't so common these days . they come not from film school but from a more intellectual direction , and i think that is because of their politics , that they saw film as a way of changing people 's minds .
jersey###city , new jersey happily , life soon returned to the mundane for jason dufner following his pga###championship triumph 10 days###ago at oak###hill###country###club in rochester , new york . as far as me personally , nothing 's changed , dufner told###reporters at liberty national on the eve of thursday 's first round of the barclays , the opening event of the fedexcup playoffs . i still took the trash out on tuesday###morning and we actually got a new puppy , so i was up at three in the morning every night taking him out to the bathroom , and still going to my favorite breakfast spot in town , dead pan dufner said . so not too much has changed in my life . my wife has n't treated me any differently and people around me are still treating me the same . and that is just the way the impassive dufner , 36 , likes it , even after stepping into the spotlight with his first major championship triumph and third career pga###tour title . there was a whirl of media attention that brought him to new york###city right after the pga for a flurry of tv appearances , but now the glamorous metropolis serves as backdrop for the high powered golf to come this week . with the statue of liberty and manhattan skyline looming over a course built over landfill on the edge of new york harbor , dufner joins world number one tiger###woods , british###open winner phil###mickelson , u.s . open winner justin###rose and masters champion adam scott among favorites in the elite 125 man field . unsurprisingly , dufner aims to stay on an even keel . i do n't put too much pressure on myself , he said . just try to do the same thing as i 've been doing the last couple years . we 've got a great set of events coming up . you can really kind of make a year out of it . i know that winning a major can make your year , but i 'm focused on trying to get back to atlanta ( tour championship . the tour championship is the climax of the four event playoffs with a field whittled down to the top 30 players on the points list with the overall series winner banking a 10 million###bonus . dufner admitted that success had whetted his appetite . i think winning one made me a little hungrier to be competitive and win more events , more majors , be part of the ryder###cup team , part of the presidents###cup team , he said . i 'm pretty good at thinking ahead and moving###forward . maybe in this case , it 's kind of a weakness because i have n't maybe enjoyed what i did a couple###weeks ago as much as maybe some other people would . dufner said he was hoping for continued###success , but understood the reality of life on the pga###tour at least for players other than tiger###woods , who is gunning for his 80th career pga###tour title . i think he spoils the media , the fans , with how well he plays , because then people think that other players should play at that level , dufner joked with his stone faced delivery . you know , 79 wins is pretty remarkable . i 've got three . if you look at the history of golf , if you win two percent of the time , you 're pretty much a hall of famer . pretty much the average guy is about one percent of the events he plays , he wins . i think tiger is probably around , 24 percent . woods is actually winning at a rate just under 26 percent with his 79 wins coming from 305 events , including five victories this season . so he 's way above the norm , and we do n't###worry about him too much , unless you 've got to face him on a sunday , said dufner .
atlanta fresh from a two stroke victory at the weather delayed bmw championship in chicago on monday , zach###johnson would dearly love to end his 2013 pga###tour campaign with a splash at this week 's tour championship . not only is another tournament win on the line at east###lake###golf###club in the season 's finale , but also fedexcup playoff honors and the eye###popping 10 million###bonus that comes with it . every player in the elite field of 30 has a mathematical chance of claiming both titles but only johnson and four others are automatically guaranteed the overall playoff prize by winning the tour championship . that 's the point of the fedexcup is you want to get in contention coming into atlanta , johnson , who is ranked###fourth in the points###standings , told###reporters at east lake on tuesday . and fortunately , i 'm in that position now where one really good week has significant incentives . the beauty of that is that we 've got a great competition here to try to get to that point , and i love it . i love everything this course demands . certainly , the field 's great . it 's just a fantastic tournament to kind of make a splash at the end of the year . i 'm excited to come back here . though thrilled with his game after charging to the 10th pga###tour victory of his career with a closing six under par 65 at conway farms in the penultimate playoff event , johnson knows the slate will be wiped clean this week . i 've still got a lot of work to do , the 37 year old american said . it was a fantastic week ( at the bmw ) from start to finish , something that hopefully i can somewhat continue into this week and beyond . this is arguably one of the best tournaments we have for sure , if not the best . it 's a tournament that encompasses the whole year , so you 've got to have good , steady play . as for the mind boggling 10 million###bonus , johnson conceded that such a big number was difficult to grapple with . that type of incentive is hard to just wrap your mind around , he smiled . i ca n't###imagine . i hate to say it , but it is just money . fortunately , i 'm in a position professionally where i do n't think that 's going to change me or my family at all , the hypotheticals , added johnson , whose has piled up more than 30 million in career###earnings on the pga###tour . when things of that nature and that magnitude have hit us before , there 's a huge filtering process , and there 's a team of individuals that we consult with on what to do and how to do things . i do n't see it being any different in that regard . any of the top five players in the points###standings would secure fedexcup honors by winning this week 's tour championship and that quintet comprises tiger###woods , swede henrik###stenson , australian adam scott and americans johnson and matt###kuchar . i 'm in a position just like the other four guys in the top five , said woods , the fedexcup champion in 2007 and 2009 and winner of a season high five titles on the 2013 pga###tour . top five you control your destiny . you win the tournament , you win it outright . sneds proved that last year , he added , referring to fellow american brandt###snedeker , who clinched the 2012 tour championship and fedexcup honors after starting the week fifth in the standings . only 30 players have qualified for the last of the four playoff events after 125 started out at the barclays tournament won by masters champion scott at liberty national last month . each of those 30 has a mathematical chance of winning the fedexcup , with the points having been reset since the bmw championship . however that likelihood diminishes the lower down the standings the player sits going into this week 's event . long hitting american dustin###johnson , ranked 30th , needs to win the tour championship with overall points###leader woods finishing no better than 29th , along with several other scenarios .
washington to be a mets starting###pitcher this season has been to put oneself into harm 's way . to review johan###santana was pictured to be the club 's opening###day###starter , but a balky shoulder ruled him out for the entire year before he threw a single official pitch in spring###training . three starters who did begin the season as planned shaun###marcum , jeremy hefner and matt###harvey succumbed at various times to season###ending injuries , while a fourth jon###niese missed two months this summer . add to them jenrry mejia , who started five games before his own elbow problems , and there crystallizes a forbidding job###description . but one pitcher has resisted the trend toward fragility . against long odds , the right hander dillon###gee knock on wood has maintained his place within the mets' rotation and avoided the disabled###list , week after perilous week . somehow , he has become the club 's most reliable starter . he 's been a huge savior for us , manager terry###collins said on friday###afternoon , a few hours before gee pitched into the eighth###inning to lead the mets to a 3 2 victory over the washington###nationals . gee has become so important that collins was gasping for breath , as he put it after the game , when he saw his pitcher walk off the mound and wince after one seventh###inning pitch . but when collins ran out to check on him , gee said he was not hurt at all . gee thought he had struck out ian###desmond , even though there were only two strikes , and he turned his back , assuming the infielders were tossing the ball around the diamond . when he realized his mistake , he panicked , and rolled his shoulder . he regretted his poor###acting job once he saw his manager , pitching coach and trainer run to the mound looking deeply###concerned . luckily for the mets , gee 's dramatic performances have been the only ones lacking these days . the outing improved gee 's record to 10 9 and dropped his earned###run###average to . 63 . before the game , collins expressed a hope albeit a very optimistic one that gee could reach 15 victories this year . either way , a player who entered this season as a major question###mark appears poised to begin the next one as a staff linchpin . as the mets left spring###training earlier this year , gee would not have been anyone 's choice to become the team 's last standing starter this season . he finished last year on the disabled###list after having a blood###clot removed from his shoulder , and though he entered the 2013 season healthy , there was work needed to get his touch back . while pitching through the opening months , he developed tendinitis around his forearm , leading his manager to speculate that he , too , might go to the disabled###list . but , unlike the others , gee never did . instead , he nestled himself into a prosperous groove , producing a . 48 e.r.a . from may 30 to aug . 25 , baseball 's fifth lowest mark during that span . missing essentially half the year last year , my main###goal coming into this was to make every start and try to get to 200 innings , gee said . if i do that by the end of the year , if i can finish strong , i 'll###feel good about the year . gee moved###closer to the goal on friday . before the game , collins praised gee 's ability to change speeds and garner ground###balls , and he did just that against the nationals , pitching seven and two thirds innings , allowing two runs , six hits and one walk while striking out three . wilson###ramos notched the nationals' first hit off gee midway through the third , and it was a big one a solo home###run into the left###field bullpen . the next half###inning , ike###davis lifted a ball to the same spot , a two###run###home###run that gave the mets a 2 1 lead . andrew###brown 's eighth###inning single scored another mets run , and it proved important , as gee allowed a solo home###run to steve lombardozzi during the bottom of the inning . but that was the only damage gee incurred , and when the night was done , he further solidified his stature on the mets' pitching staff . he has accomplished this through honing his slider command , working aggressively to both sides of the strike###zone , and , just as important , staying healthy . the best pitching staff is the healthiest pitching staff , collins said . it 's not always the most talented . manager terry###collins said shortstop ruben tejada would play quite a bit when he was called back up to the majors next month although he did not know when the promotion would occur . tejada has not played for the mets since may , when he went on the disabled###list amid a hugely disappointing start at the plate . on july , when he was healthy enough to play , he was optioned to the minor###leagues . collins said , we 've got to find out what 's going on , and we 'd like to see how he handles some things right now , too , because i know he 's probably saying to himself , 'i 've got something to prove .

( reuters ) newcastle midfielder yohan###cabaye has apologised to the club 's supporters for being distracted by a bid from arsenal in the first weeks of the premier###league season . the france international , who missed the first three games of the season as he was pursued by the london club , made his first start on saturday as the magpies beat aston###villa 2 1 and received a warm ovation as he was substituted off . if the fans were or still are mad at me for what happened then i understand and i apologise to them . i want to come back from what has happened , cabaye told the club 's website ( www . nufc . co . uk . for newcastle fans , football is their life and i want to say that i am going to give everything as i have from my first day here from today until the end of the season . last month , angry manager alan###pardew said the former lille player had been distracted by the 10 million###pound bid from arsenal on the eve of newcastle 's premier###league opener at manchester###city , and branded the offer disrespectful and ill timed . cabaye said he had moved on and was happy to stay at the club in an important year leading up to the world###cup . i want to forget what happened during the summer , i want to put it behind me and give everything for newcastle every day , for the club and for my team###mates , he said . it is very important to be right in my head and i am .
london cuadrilla resources , a british shale###gas company , has suspended drilling activity at its site in balcombe , the village south of london that has become a focus of protests against britain 's efforts to develop a shale###gas industry . although the company is drilling for oil , not gas , at balcombe , its activities there have become symbolic of the shale###gas effort in britain because cuadrilla has been in the forefront of shale###gas exploration in northwest england . the company attracted the wrong sort of attention in 2011 when early###efforts to hydraulically fracture a well in lancashire set off minor earthquakes . cuadrilla said friday that it had decided to suspend drilling after taking advice from the local###police in sussex , following threats of direct###action against the exploration site . the company said it was acting in the interest of the safety of its own staff , balcombe residents and protesters . a person close to the company said that cuadrilla was concerned that protesters might invade the site , as they have done at a cuadrilla site in northern###england . the person asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak about the issue . the decision not only delays cuadrilla 's exploration###program but is damaging to the government backed effort to develop shale and other so called unconventional###oil and gas to replace declining production in the north###sea . britain is thought to have substantial shale###gas resources but it will require###extensive drilling and testing to discover whether the gas in the ground can be profitably produced . amid the controversy in balcombe , prime###minister david###cameron has weighed in on the debate . in an article published last sunday in the sunday###telegraph , which is considered staple reading of his conservative###party constituents , mr . cameron wrote in support of fracking , the technique of pumping liquids and sand down wells to cause the rock to release trapped oil and gas . if we do n't back this technology , we will miss a massive opportunity to help families with their bills and make our country more competitive , mr . cameron wrote . the antifracking movement appears to be gaining###momentum . campaigners said that protesters from throughout the british###isles were planning to converge on balcombe this weekend in a march for a frack free future . cuadrilla , whose chairman is a former bp chief###executive , john###browne , already appeared to be backing down this week when it said that while it would continue its exploration at balcombe , the drilling###site there was unlikely to become a permanent production site . cuadrilla has to delay drilling until next week . that 's a huge victory , katriona vetch , an activist in balcombe , said by telephone .
los###angeles the scorched body found inside the burned out cabin near big###bear###lake where law###enforcement###officers were caught in a deadly shootout this week has been positively identified as that of christopher j . dorner , the authorities announced on thursday . mr . dorner , 33 , a former los###angeles police###officer who the authorities believe killed four people this month , had been the subject of a regionwide manhunt since last week . his body was identified through a dental examination , according to the san###bernardino sheriff 's department . no cause of death was given . the sheriff had already expressed###confidence that mr . dorner had been killed , after a bloody confrontation on tuesday that left one san###bernardino sheriff 's deputy dead and another seriously wounded . we believe the investigation is over , john mcmahon , the san###bernardino county###sheriff , said at a news conference on wednesday , before the body had been identified . mr . dorner had pledged revenge against law###enforcement###officers in a manifesto he posted###online , which named members of the los###angeles###police###department as targets . his killing spree began on feb . 3 , when he killed the daughter of a former los###angeles###police captain and her fianc . he then killed a riverside police###officer on feb . 7 and wounded another officer . the manhunt for him intensified that day , when his car was discovered burned in big###bear###lake , a mountain resort area about 100 miles east of los###angeles . but mr . dorner did not re emerge until tuesday , having apparently hidden in an unoccupied cabin for several days . he stole a vehicle , the authorities said , and eventually crashed it , carjacked another one and then fled into the woods , where he was surrounded in the cabin .
detroit a drastic reversal###of###fortune in the western###conference###semifinals has left the chicago###blackhawks discouraged and on the verge of elimination . the blackhawks began the season on a record###setting tear , earning at least a point in 24 straight###games , and went on to win the presidents' trophy for the league 's best record . but the detroit###red###wings , who slid into the playoffs as the west 's no . 7 seed , lead the teams' second round series , three games to one . the blackhawks have lost three straight , their longest slide of the season . game 5 is in chicago on saturday . we 're all frustrated , chicago forward patrick###sharp said . it 's not about one guy . we 're a whole team in here . sharp added there 's no use hanging our heads . our backs are against the wall . we have to play our best game in chicago . there 's no other options . we can dig in here . the red###wings' confidence has been growing in the playoffs , while the blackhawks appear to be coming apart . five blackhawks shots have hit goal###posts in the last two games , and nothing seems to be clicking . still , the red###wings are not taking anything for granted . they 're going to play even more desperate on saturday###night , said detroit goalie jimmy###howard , who recorded his first shutout of the 2013 playoffs with a 2 0 win in game 4 on thursday . we 're going to have to match it . we ca n't rest on our laurels here . sharp , the blackhawks' top playoff scorer with six goals , has no goals and one assist during chicago 's three game###skid . other key###components of chicago 's offense , wing marian hossa and the captain jonathan###toews , have no points during the streak . howard 's strong goaltending and the red###wings' defense are among the main reasons for the blackhawks' slump . another sign of trouble for chicago is that the usually calm toews has had emotional outbursts . he displayed a critical lack of poise during the second period of game , taking three consecutive penalties in 5 minutes 34 seconds . toews strongly###objected to the calls , screaming at the officials as he skated to the penalty###box . he also sniped at the red###wings between plays . in the second period , toews spent 04 on the ice and 6 minutes stewing in the box . his second penalty , for high sticking , led to the game###winning###goal by jakub kindl . it was the first power###play###goal the blackhawks had allowed in nearly a month , ending their postseason streak of killing 30 consecutive penalties . toews , known as a smart and offensively gifted player , has no goals during the playoffs . i 'm not going to say anything about the officiating , toews said after game . obviously , i disagree with the calls . it 's in the heat of the moment they see what they see . he added eventually , something 's got to give . we 're too good a team . we 've got too much talent . for as hard as we 're working , something 's got to go our way . the red###wings , particularly the captain henrik###zetterberg , have been agitating toews with physical###play . we 'd like to keep him in the box , defenseman jonathan ericsson said of toews 's penalties . he 's not as good for them in the box . howard added that zetterberg 's defense had caused much of toews 's frustration . he 's all over him out there , howard said . he 's really taking away his time and space out there and not really letting him generate much . when z 's out there and he 's working as hard as he 's working , it sends a message to the rest of the team that they have to do their part . red###wings coach mike###babcock tried to put his team 's playoff###success in perspective , conceding that he had felt doubts about how detroit would fare . asked whether he was surprised to have a 3 1 series lead , babcock said if you 'd asked me two months###ago , i would be shocked . we started###playing better and better . once we got through the anaheim series , you go in thinking you have an opportunity . we 're competing at a high , high###level . there 's a lot to be said for effort and battling .
athens , ga . annie park brought more than great skills to southern###california 's women 's golf team . the bubbly freshman from levittown , n.y. , also showed her new teammates how to enjoy their time on the course and ignore the pressure . i think she helped loosen up the team in general , which is important , senior sophia popov said . you 've got to have fun out there . you can always rely on her . you can say that . park shot a 1 under 71 to top the individual standings and help southern###california win its third ncaa###tournament title with a record###setting team performance friday . southern###california finished at 19 under , 133 15 strokes better than the previous tournament mark set by ucla in 2004 to beat second place duke by 21 strokes at the university of georgia golf course . third place purdue was 21 over 40 shots behind southern###california . park finished at 10 under for a six stroke victory over duke 's lindy duncan . kyung kim and popov tied for sixth at 1 over for southern###california , which finished second to alabama last year by one shot . park was in high###school when southern###california had a five stroke lead vanish on the back nine last year in franklin , tenn . entering the pac 12 tournament last month in los###angeles , park was n't sure what to think of her game . she had one victory and three other top 10 finishes in six events , but was 27th the week before at arizona###state . not only did park win the pac , she also tied for first two weeks later at the west###regional . even so , she hardly imagined leaving athens as the ncaa champion . it was unexpected , park said . i was just trying to play my best in each round and shot . it turned out to be good . alabama junior stephanie meadow endured a different kind of day in the swirling wind . despite leading the nation this season with a.1 scoring###average and beginning the final round just two strokes off the lead , meadow fell out contention with a double###bogey on the par 4 ninth hole . meadow , the tournament 's top seed , finished with an 80 to tie for sixth at 1 over . i do n't really know what happened today , meadow said . i just kind of fell off the map and once it went , it went . it 's hard to come back when you 're going through that emotionally , but it 's something i 've got to learn from because there 's going to be days in the future when i do this . it wo n't be the last time i shoot . park became the seventh freshman to win the individual title , joining a group that includes annika sorenstam of arizona in , vicki goetze of georgia in 1992 and austin ernst of lsu in . southern cal assistant###coach justin silverstein cited park 's ability to block out distractions as a strength not seen often in freshmen . there 's no change in emotion if she makes three birdies in a row or a couple bogeys , silverstein said . her ability to miss it in the proper spots is something you rarely see from an 18 year old and an ability to do that on a golf course this hard is what kind of what separates people like her from the rest of the pack . under head###coach andrea gaston , the trojans also won###national###titles in 2003 and . i just saw so much fight in these girls , gaston said . we had some tough holes and we fought back and made some birdies to bring our scores back . i think the most impressive thing is it was a team victory . all of them counted at least twice this week .
washington excessive###heat is the no . 1 weather killer in the united###states and it 's at its most dangerous when it does n't###cool down at night . the current heat###wave over california , nevada , arizona and new mexico has temperatures hitting triple digits , with little relief at night . hot###weather is also baking the rest of the far west , including washington , oregon , idaho , and parts of utah and montana . q what 's so disturbing about this current heat###wave ? a it 's unrelenting stubbornness . there is no relief at night . phoenix set a record for highest nighttime temperature 91 . las###vegas has gone three days without getting below , according to readings at the airport . nighttime heat is especially bad , said eli jacks , chief of fire and public weather services at the national###weather###service . not to get below 90 is crazy . q what 's so dangerous about that ? if you are n't in an air###conditioned place , your body never has a chance to recover at night , jacks said . normally the feels like index which factors in temperature and humidity has to get to 80 degrees or below for your body to recover from the daytime heat , jacks said . the lack of nighttime cooling is more dangerous than the 117 degree all time record in las###vegas , experts said . q how do heat waves compare to other weather killers ? a in recent###years , heat has been more deadly than other weather extremes in the united###states . on average , heat waves are killing about 117 people a year , according to figures from the national###oceanic###and###atmospheric###administration . however , those numbers are incomplete and only based on reports during periods of extreme###heat . the much more comprehensive numbers from the centers###for###disease###control and prevention indicate that on average 658 people die each year from too much heat . q who is most at risk ? a the elderly and children . the elderly make up 36 percent of heat deaths in the past decade , according to the cdc . and of all the excessive###heat deaths , 69 percent are men . also on average , 37 children left in car seats die from heat each year , according to a study at san###francisco###state###university . q what can you do to stay###safe ? a drink lots of water the dry heat in the southwest evaporates sweat so quickly that people do n't notice they are perspiring and get dehydrated more quickly , jacks said . stay in the shade and out of the heat between 10 a.m . and 4 p.m . use sunblock of spf 15 or higher . wear light colored clothing and light clothing . reduce use of caffeine and alcohol , which tend to dehydrate , and slow down . q so what 's causing all this ? a part of it is normal summer heat spurts , said meteorologist kenneth james of the weather###prediction###center in college###park , md . but there 's another factor and that 's the jet###stream . normally the jet###stream moves generally west to east , but when it slows and swings dramatically to the north or south , extreme###weather can happen . what 's happening now is a really big kink in the jet###stream , about as big as you can see anytime , covering the whole western u.s. , said heat###wave expert ken kunkel , a professor of atmospheric###sciences at north###carolina###state###university . to the west of the kink , in arizona and nevada , there 's a high pressure system just parked there with stagnant heat , kunkel said . and to its east are cool even record cool temperatures in texas , he said . q when will it end ? a the extreme###heat should continue for about a week , but it wo n't set records , james said . q is this related to the deadly arizona fire ? a there 's most assuredly a link between the heat###wave and the fire , jacks said . it gets hot with extremely###dry air , and then a no rain lightning strike ignites bone dry fuel into a fire . a no single event can be blamed solely on man made global###warming , scientists and meteorologists say . but this is the type of heat###wave than scientists have long said will be more common as the world warms . some , but not all , scientists also theorize that the jet###stream is having more of these crazy kinks lately because of a warming arctic and melting sea###ice . pennsylvania###state###university climate scientist michael###mann said there 's an element of randomness in the current weather . yet with all time heat records in the past few years being broken at three times the expected rate , he said , there can be little doubt that climate###change and global###warming are playing a role .
( reuters ) gareth###bale said his drawn out move to real###madrid for a world record###transfer###fee was stressful to say the least . the 24 year old joined madrid from tottenham###hotspur on sunday for 100 million###euros . 4 million###pounds , a fee which made him the world 's most expensive player , the day before the transfer###window closed and after months of speculation about his future . it was a long time . it was very stressful to say the least , bale told bt###sport on thursday . i knew their interest from the start and i was always confident the move would go through but obviously the chairman daniel###levy had to do his business and do tottenham well so i kind of understood that . but at the same time , thinking of myself , it was a hard time , it was stressful and i just had to be patient and try and focus . bale is currently preparing for wales 's upcoming world###cup###qualifiers against macedonia and serbia after being unveiled at madrid 's bernabeu on monday . he has not played since july and missed most of spurs' pre###season###training due to injury , so is unlikely to play the full 90 minutes in either friday or tuesday 's qualifier . he rejoined his wales team###mates soon after being presented to thousands of fans as madrid 's latest galactico signing and said it was somewhat of a relief to be back among familiar###faces . it 's obviously been a whirlwind few days , the former southampton player said . it 's quite nice to come back , relax and get back to normality , really . having set the premier###league alight last season with 21 goals in 33 league appearances , spurs fans were hoping he would stick with the club and help them continue their push for a spot in the champions###league , having missed out to bitter london rivals arsenal by one point . however , bale said once madrid showed their interest in him he was determined to move and realise a boyhood dream , with a picture being revealed at his unveiling of him wearing a club shirt as a child . when i was younger i had some close###friends and we always loved european###football and real###madrid at that time were the dominant force and we always watched real###madrid , he said . i remember family holidays , we used to go spain , and we 'd bring back replica shirts of real###madrid and wear them out and always pretend to be the players when we played in the park . it just started from there and i followed them since . obviously the football they play , the team they are is amazing and it 's just great to be there .

los###angeles kobe###bryant was n't###happy about spending christmas day on the sideline , unable to help the struggling los###angeles###lakers . it 's a place he 's unaccustomed to being on the holiday . bryant leads the nba with a record 15 appearances on christmas day , but he 's out an expected four to six weeks with a fracture in his left knee . it 's strange to be coming in on christmas and not playing , he said before the lakers' 101 95 loss to the miami###heat on wednesday . it 's a foreign feeling , but i 'm here to support my guys . lebron###james and co . have won six in a row , and the lakers have dropped three straight . it 's not as special when kobe 's not out there , james said afterward . bryant 's injury was diagnosed last week , his second major one of the season . he did n't###play his first game until dec . 8 after nearly eight months away while recovering from a###torn###achilles###tendon . then he got hurt again dec . 17 at memphis while playing his fourth###game in five nights . i was fortunate that it was not a meniscus , he said . initially , bryant did n't think he was seriously hurt against memphis . he went down late in the third quarter , but returned to finish out the victory in which he logged a season high 21 points in 32 minutes . i did n't know it was fractured , he said . i was expecting a bone###bruise more than anything else . i thought ( the doctor ) was joking when he told me . bryant has been limited to riding a bike he is n't supposed to put any pressure on his knee . it 's just been slow in terms of laying off it and letting it heal , he said . when you do n't have activity , you got to watch the other parts like nutrition . typical of bryant 's attention to detail , he said he has been reading critical###comments that suggest he wo n't return this season . it 's the same old tune , just being sung a little more loudly now , he said . these type of things just help me lock in more . asked if there 's any chance he wo n't be back , bryant replied , not that i 'm aware of . james said , when he comes back he 's going to play at a high###level . los###angeles signed the 35 year old guard to a two year , 48 . 5 million###contract###extension in november . james , along with other nba players , tweeted out well wishes to bryant , although the two superstars had n't talked until they shared a post###game hug . especially games like today , you want to have the best guys out there , james said beforehand . after the achilles injury , bryant expressed rare self doubt . he has n't felt any this time . the knee is not really a concern to me , he said . the biggest question was would the achilles respond to my game . it felt fine . it was strong . bryant was looking forward to playing against the defending nba champions as a way to see where he was physically with his achilles . this was a really big measuring stick , he said . instead , he sat at the end of the bench wearing a black suit and print t###shirt . he sat on a chair with extra inches of padding , likely to take stress off his left knee . my spirits are fine , he said . i feel more locked in now than my entire###career .
detroit this city was already sinking under hundreds of millions###of###dollars in bills that it could not pay when a municipal auditor brought in a veteran financial###consultant to dig through the books . a seasoned turnaround man and former actuary with ford###motor co . , he was stunned by what he found an additional . 2 billion in retiree###health costs that had never been reported , or even tallied up . the city must take some drastic steps , the consultant , john###boyle , warned the city###council in delivering his report at a public meeting in . among the options he suggested was filing###for###bankruptcy . i thought all hell would break###loose i thought the flag would finally be raised , mr . boyle recalled in an interview last week . but his warning drew little notice . it was utterly astounding , he said . the financial###crisis that has made detroit one of the largest###cities ever to face mandatory state oversight was decades in the making , a trail of missteps , of trimming too little , too late , of hoping that deep###rooted structural###problems would turn out to be cyclical downturns that might melt away as the economy picked up . some factors were out of the city 's control . as auto###industry jobs moved elsewhere over the decades , for example , detroit lost much of its affluent tax base . lower than expected state revenue###sharing did not help , nor did corruption allegations in the administration of kwame m . kilpatrick , a mayor who resigned in 2008 and was convicted on monday of racketeering and other federal charges . but recent###findings from a state appointed review team and interviews with past and present city officials also suggest a city that over the years was remarkably badly run . the state review team found in recent###months that the city 's main courthouse had 280 million worth of uncollected fines and fees . no one could tell the team how many police###officers were patrolling the streets , even though public safety accounted for a little more than half the budget . the city was borrowing from restricted funds and keeping unclaimed property that it was required to turn over to the state . in some city departments , records were basically stuff written on index cards , as one city###council member put it . this was bad###decisions piled on top of each other , gary brown , the detroit###city###council president###pro###tem , said the other day . it has all been a strategy of hope . you keep borrowing where every piece of collateral is already leveraged . you have no bonding capacity you 're at junk status . you 're overestimating revenues and not managing the resources . now the chickens have come home to roost . once the nation 's fourth###largest city , detroit had grown up around the auto###industry , booming right along with it in the 1950s . city workers gained###ground with pay###increases intended to keep pace with those the united###auto###workers won for its members , analysts said . it was easy to do so back in the 1950s , said joseph l . harris , detroit 's former auditor general . the city had . 8 million###residents then . but as auto jobs moved elsewhere and the region aged , detroit 's labor costs retiree health###care###costs , especially ballooned . at the same time , officials papered over growing deficits with more borrowing . finally detroit 's legal debt limit , which is linked to the total value of real###estate in the city , fell when the mortgage bubble###burst and property###values plunged . today the city says its debt limit is 1 billion , and it has effectively lost its ability to issue debt in the name of its taxpayers . when a city cannot borrow , it cannot function new york###city showed that in , cleveland in . but even as detroit has approached the critical limit , some city leaders have seemed unaware , quarreling over smaller , symbolic issues like whether to lease a city owned park to the state . it is peeling an onion , mayor dave###bing said of his growing###understanding after he took office in 2009 of the depths of the city 's financial###woes . you dig and you dig and you dig , and you really start to find out how bad the problem was . mr . bing knew plenty about the city 's struggles before taking###office and ran on a platform of reversing the spiraling finances . still , within his first six months in office , the city came close to not making payroll .
rancho###mirage , calif . as michelle###wie and her playing partner emerged from the scoring tent behind the ninth hole at mission###hills###country###club on thursday , one spectator turned to another and said , is n't she the one that 's the youngest###player ? the fan was referring to lydia###ko , the 15 year old from new zealand who carded a par , the same as wie , in her debut at the kraft###nabisco###championship , the first women 's major of the year . na###yeon choi , jodi ewart shadoff and suzann###pettersen were tied for the lead at four under . the juxtaposition of ko and wie , a world###weary , was a jarring reminder of time 's inexorable march . for years , wie was the game 's child star . at , she made her debut here and became the youngest###player to make the cut on her way to a tie for ninth . by the time she was ko 's age , wie had added a fourth###place###finish in the tournament and put the masters in her cross hairs . her stated###goal of playing in the men 's first major was one of many youthful utterances that have come back to haunt wie , who was reminded thursday that in her first appearance here she also floated the idea of forgoing professional golf to become a teacher or an entrepreneur . it 's really funny hearing all the things that you say when you 're , 14 , 15 , she said . you just look back , and you 're like , the stuff that came out of my mouth . since turning###pro in , wie has won two tournaments . ko , the top ranked amateur , has three victories against pro competition , including last year 's canadian open on the l.p.g.a . tour . in an interview in golf###magazine , annika sorenstam , who was at the top of the women 's game when wie burst onto the scene as a giggly teenager , questioned wie 's career###path , including her decision to play in several men 's events and to pursue an education at stanford after eschewing college golf to turn pro . yeah , she actually reached out to me last night , said a couple things got misquoted , wie said . and i thought it was really nice of her to reach out to me . she apologized for what she said , and i accept it , and that 's that . on the same day that sorenstam 's comments hit the internet , wie 's name came up on espn 's pre masters teleconference with reporters . the golf analyst andy###north was speaking in general about players whose pursuit of financial###success has thwarted their golfing development when paul###azinger interjected , you know , the best example of that is probably michelle###wie , the greatest raw###talent of all time , and it just has n't materialized . wie 's stalled career has not pitched her spirits into a downward###spiral . rather than shrink from the spotlight , wie styled her shoulder###length###hair in a manner that was sure to draw###attention she dyed the ends pink , purple and turquoise . i just got really bored at home last week , wie said , laughing . she also is able to smile at her bad swings and shrug off criticism of her bent at the waist tabletop putting stroke by the likes of the golf###channel analyst judy###rankin , who said i 'll be as candid as i can be . i see nothing good about it . it is almost as if criticism has become such a constant that wie is immune to its sting . it 's like i tried to explain to annika last night in my text###messages , she said . i did n't plan for any of this to happen , it just kind of happened . wie added , i 'm going with the flow and trying not to have any regrets because i think even if you do make mistakes , you still learn from it , and i 'm having a lot of fun . ko radiates joy , playing the game as if missed putts carry no consequences . she has a fluid swing for someone who is carrying the pride of a country on her shoulders . her first round was televised###live in new zealand , where she moved as a child with her family from her native south###korea . before this year , ko said , the tournament coverage consisted of a few highlights on the news . yeah , because we do n't exactly have like golf###channel , ko said . playing with ko , wie said , was a good walk remembered . it just brought me back to memory lane a little bit , and it felt good , she said . wie shied away from any comparisons of ko to her teenage self . i think she 's really good on her own , wie said . does n't really play like a 15 year old . like wie , who chose stanford because she wanted to follow in the footsteps of tiger###woods , ko aspires to attend stanford to be like her childhood###idol , wie . what is it like to be old enough to be an inspiration to the next generation ? that 's weird , wie said . she laughed . that 's really strange . wie added she mentioned that to me that she wants to go to stanford like me . it was kind of strange , i have to say , but i 'm just really rooting for her .
washington the number of americans applying for unemployment###benefits rose by , 000 last week to a seasonally adjusted , 000 , an increase largely caused after california processed a huge backlog of claims and after the partial government###shutdown prompted some companies to cut jobs . the labor department said on thursday that the less volatile four week average rose , 000 , to , 000 . the rise in both the weekly figures and the four week average comes after applications hovered near a six year low the previous###week . a government spokesman said about half the weekly increase occurred in california , where officials processed applications that had been delayed several weeks by a computer upgrade . one quarter of the increase reflected applications from employees at government###contractors and others affected by the shutdown . applications are a proxy for layoffs . before last week , they had declined###steadily over the last three months , a sign that companies were cutting fewer###workers . the broader picture is still that labor market conditions are improving , albeit not quite as much as we previously###thought , said paul ashworth , an economist at capital economics . federal workers temporarily laid off by the shutdown may also file for benefits , but their numbers are reported separately and published a week later than the other applications . lockheed###martin said on monday that it was furloughing about , 400 employees , fewer than the , 000 it initially said it would furlough , as chuck###hagel , the defense secretary , recalled most of the pentagon 's civilian employees . declining applications are typically followed by more hiring , but job gains have slowed in recent###months . the government was unable to issue the september employment report because of the shutdown , so it is not clear if hiring trends changed last month .

just as the christmas season in new york belongs to handel , with messiah , the easter season belongs to bach . among other things this year the bach variations , the current festival of the new york philharmonic you can generally count on hearing the two big passions in some inscrutably shifting balance . last year the st . john passion predominated . this year the st . matthew took over , after an early st . john by dennis keene and the voices of ascension on feb . 28 . mr . keene 's chorus performed in typically splendid fashion at the church of the ascension the orchestra , less so . john###scott and the st . thomas choir of men and boys opened a run of st . matthew performances on march , bach 's 328th birthday , at st . thomas###church fifth avenue , and julian wachner and the choir of trinity wall###street and trinity baroque orchestra added another three days later at trinity church . regular followers of the new york choral and early###music scenes knew what to expect from those excellent ensembles , and it mostly came to pass . the wild###card was a performance by the orchestra of st . luke 's on thursday###evening at carnegie###hall featuring the musica###sacra chorus and conducted by ivan fischer . mr . fischer , a maestro rightly celebrated for his work in the standard###repertory especially with his budapest###festival###orchestra but also with st . luke 's , which played beautifully for him here has revealed himself in new york as an inveterate tinkerer and imaginative experimenter . his appearances have included a survey of the beethoven symphonies , some on period###instruments , some on modern , in an acclaimed staged###concert presentation of mozart 's don###giovanni in and a mozart requiem in 2012 in which he strewed choristers among the instrumentalists to give the players a more vivid sense of the text . in general mr . fischer 's interventions have sought to heighten the works' inherent drama , whether abstract or concrete . and since the trend with the bach passions in recent###years has been to bring out their theatrical potential , as in extraordinary staged###productions of the st . matthew by jonathan###miller at the brooklyn###academy###of###music and peter###sellars with the berlin###philharmonic , you could imagine that mr . fischer would offer ideas of his own along these lines . he had ideas , all right , but many of them appeared wrongheaded , even perverse , undercutting rather than supporting the drama . the central problem was his seemingly haphazard distribution of voices . the key###figures in the passion , almost by definition , are the evangelist and jesus , and most performances today strive to create markedly individual and consistent characterizations of those roles . this tendency has been enhanced by the emergence of a number of tenors who sing the part of the evangelist high and excitable , long and draining with real###beauty and distinction rather than simply as a character role . among the most notable of those is rufus m ller , who sang in the st . thomas performance . a veteran of the jonathan###miller staging , mr . m ller sings the part of st . matthew ( and st . john ) from memory . actually he does not so much sing the role as inhabit it . even when he is not singing he is a participant , closely observing others and offering subtle commentary through facial###expressions , registering irony , for example , with a twist of the lip but without mugging . seemingly under the weather on this occasion and struggling vocally through the second part , mr . m ller nevertheless gave a typically compelling characterization . he had a worthy foil in the strong jesus of douglas williams , who also sang from memory . the trinity pair , william hite as the evangelist and stephen salters as jesus , were also excellent . mr . hite , in fine###voice , remained content to describe the action rather than live it , a legitimate , time honored approach . like mr . williams , mr . salters put a premium on power , over the warmth that some bring to jesus . the two were made more distinctive by their placement in mr . wachner 's conception mr . hite in the pulpit , mr . salters on a thronelike chair atop a platform thrust into the aisle , amid audience members . similarly , if more modestly , mr . fischer placed his jesus hanno m ller brachmann on a low platform onstage alongside the evangelist , john tessier , at carnegie###hall . but whatever symbolism may have been achieved there was smashed when mr . m ller brachmann also sang judas and pilate from the same perch . and why was he singing these minor roles , often allotted to chorus members , in the first place ? jesus in dialogue with judas or with pilate in the same person ? it 's pretty hard to pick up the dramatic pieces after that , and mr . fischer made no attempt to do so . although he had tenor , baritone and bass soloists on hand for most of the arias , he enlisted mr . tessier for one and mr . m ller brachmann ( now off the platform ) for two others . it was a babel of voices . none of which should be taken to detract from the terrific performances of mr . tessier , who sang vividly in the descriptive mode , or mr . m ller brachmann , who finally###brought warmth to jesus but also faded vocally toward the end , partly , perhaps , because of the overwork of the added arias . the two church performances , at least , did not disappoint . mr . wachner and mr . scott routinely work wonders with their disparate choruses mr . scott 's with the soft###core of boys' voices , mr . wachner 's with a solid , vibrant center . but there was nothing disparate about the orchestras , both drawn from the growing pool of period instrument players in new york , fed lately by the historical###performance program of the juilliard###school . almost half the players were common to both orchestras , with more veterans in james richman 's concert royal at st . thomas , more newcomers in mr . wachner 's trinity baroque orchestra . it was amusing to see the concertmasters of the divided orchestras switch chairs and big solos cynthia roberts , concertmaster of orchestra i at st . thomas , orchestra ii at trinity robert mealy , the opposite . both performances gave vivid evidence of a newly thriving early###music scene in new york . at long last .
a comet that once promised to light up the night###skies then all but vanished , and later seemed to blaze back to life is now fading away , astronomers say . i think for the most part it 's dead , said c . alex young , the associate###director for science in the heliophysics division at nasa 's goddard###space###flight###center in greenbelt , md . the folks are finally pretty confident that 's the case . en###route to its demise , the comet , ison , has provided one twist after another . on thursday , when it made its closest###approach to the sun , the comet eluded observation , and scientists###concluded that it had disintegrated and vaporized . then , a few hours later , it reappeared . a bright###spot at the head of the comet suggested that part of its icy nucleus had survived . but the resurrection was short lived . ison faded again over the weekend . by sunday , it was already so dim that its debris will no longer be visible to the naked###eye when it passes through earth 's region this month . i really do n't think there 's a whole lot left , said karl battams , an astrophysicist at the naval###research###laboratory who has spent a week observing ison at the kitt###peak###national###observatory in arizona . i 'm very disappointed for the public , because we 're not going to see this beautiful object in the northern###hemisphere skies . dr . battams said the comet had probably fallen largely apart before its closest###approach to the sun . he said it was difficult to tell what was seen moving away from the sun . the comet may have possessed a small###nucleus that has since vaporized . or the ice that holds it together had already vaporized , leaving just a loose pile of rubble . it 's also possible it was just a cloud of dust at that point , dr . battams said . the comet , discovered in september 2012 while still beyond jupiter 's orbit , originated from the oort###cloud , a region of icy debris over a light###year from the sun . for scientists , the excitement of observation is over , but the work of analyzing###data to understand what happened will take weeks and months . the complete disintegration of ison could give better information about its composition and hints of how the planets formed than if it had remained###intact . scientifically , i do n't know if it gets much better than seeing the comet being ripped###apart , falling apart right before your eyes , dr . battams said .
the fallout from the latest episode in johnny###manziel 's dizzying , tmz chronicled off season extended beyond his inner circle and beyond the campus of texas a m and into the offices of the n.c.a.a . that organization , which governs college sports , said nothing about manziel on monday , and yet its silence did little to dim the continued criticism lobbed in its direction . on sunday###night , espn , citing anonymous###sources , reported the n.c.a.a . was investigating whether manziel , last season 's heisman###trophy###winner , pocketed a five figure flat###fee to sign###autographs at the bowl###championship###series national###title###game in january in south###florida . the n.c.a.a. , following its investigation protocol , declined to confirm or comment on the report , even as the narrative shifted from whether manziel , a sophomore , would be suspended to why he could not profit off his signature in the first place , which is a violation of n.c.a.a . rules . that shift spoke to the current climate of college sports and to the pressure the organization will face as it looks into the allegations against manziel . that is the backdrop , the latest salvo in this summer of discontent public###sentiment that is increasingly###hostile , aimed at the n.c.a.a . 's idea of amateurism , which is facing legal###challenges in addition to political ones . there is the lawsuit , ed###o'bannon versus the n.c.a.a. , winding its way through the california court system , which centers on who owns an athlete 's likeness . the case could be classified as a class###action###suit this month . there is the organization 's recent enforcement track record , which is best described as blemished . there is the unwieldy rule book and the seemingly continual conference###realignment and the promised reforms that have been slow to materialize . now there is manziel , one of the biggest###stars in college sports and yet one who stands accused of violating a rule long###ago deemed draconian by advocates of n.c.a.a . change . the organization , in this case and in others , must enforce that rule diligently . but not only is proving such transgressions difficult , but if proven , then what ? what this says is the n.c.a.a . and college athletics are under a lot of stress right now on a lot of fronts , said josephine potuto , the former chairwoman of the n.c.a.a . 's committee on infractions and a law professor at nebraska . every news story seems to feed into one of the components of the big###picture that seems to be under attack no matter what comes up . texas a m opened its preseason###camp monday . manziel practiced , but did not talk to the news###media . coach kevin###sumlin told###reporters that he learned of the potential autograph issue sunday , same as everyone else . his reaction find out the facts first . the espn report has troubled some in the sports autograph and memorabilia industry , including theo chen , the owner and operator of autographsforsale . com , which made its debut in . chen says there are more autograph dealers in florida than anywhere else in the united###states , so it made sense if the possible signing had occurred there . he also points to the volume of sequentially numbered signed manziel photographs that appeared on ebay . to chen , that indicates definitely a sit down signing , one that would take days , if not weeks , to prepare for , which would require advance###notice and planning . this would absolutely be the first time i 've###heard of any kind of college player with eligibility remaining doing something that obvious , chen said . he added i totally get the fact he 's irritated he 's signing for free . that is completely understandable . the n.c.a.a . is hypocritical in the way it enforces that . chen 's take underscored the n.c.a.a . 's tenuous###position , that of enforcing a rule others can profit off manziel but he cannot make money off himself that not everyone agrees with and quite a few condemn . that and conducting an investigation on the heels of the botched look into miami 's athletic misconduct and the penalties handed to penn###state without the usual enforcement due process . that after several members of the n.c.a.a . 's enforcement staff have left for other jobs in recent###months . such is the current climate . manziel is required to cooperate with the organization and its investigators if he wants to remain###eligible . he is required to hand over bank records if requested . he will be required to explain any deposits that raise eyebrows . ( manziel 's parents did not respond to messages seeking comment . texas a m declined to comment . ) these allegations are different from and more serious than the rest of manziel 's off season , a mishmash of trotting the globe and meeting stars . manziel met drake . he met lebron###james . he took online###classes to avoid the crush of being a celebrity on campus , but then he sought celebrity in his travels . he wanted it all , wanted the life of a 20 year old college student and the life of a heisman###trophy###winner , but seemingly without the spotlight that accompanied it . all that took a nasty turn in recent weeks , with his family making critical statements about texas a m in an espn the magazine article the controversy over his admitted oversleeping at the manning passing academy , where he was a counselor before being asked to leave and with an incident in which he was kicked out of a fraternity party at the university of texas . manziel 's off season has become a spectacular combustion . he also has the most anticipated game of the college###football season looming , against alabama on sept . 14 . only now , the n.c.a.a . is involved and the stakes are higher , and two entities near the end of long and scrutinized summers are seeing their paths intersect . for both , the season cannot start soon enough .
beverly###hills , calif . michal handzus 's nickname , zus , does not refer to the greek god , but he has seemingly been omnipresent for both teams in the western###conference###finals . handzus centers the chicago###blackhawks' second line and has been a mainstay on their playoff leading penalty###kill . he also played four seasons in los###angeles and had a significant###role in the formative###years of a stanley###cup###champion . he really left his imprint on a lot of the players that are with l.a . today , said terry###murray , the former kings coach , who was with the club from 2008 to . kopitar , jarret###stoll , dustin###brown and matt###greene , the kings' leadership group , i know that he left a big###impression with those young###men and really helped them to become the great###players that they are today . handzus , 36 , played for the blackhawks briefly in , appearing in only eight games and sustaining a###torn###anterior###cruciate###ligament . but it was enough time for both parties to seek out each other near the trade###deadline this year as chicago acquired him for a draft###pick on april . handzus had posted only two points in 28 games with san###jose , which he paired with a minus 9 rating , all while his birth###certificate continued to gray and fray . but the blackhawks had competition for handzus and were enthused to land a versatile veteran forward . they have been rewarded handsomely for their confidence . going into game 5 on thursday###night , handzus has eight points and a plus 5 rating during the postseason . he had a five game scoring###streak as chicago surged from a 3 1 series deficit to topple detroit and then took a 2 0 series lead over los###angeles . handzus was held off the score###sheet in a 3 1 loss in game 3 on tuesday , but he found ways to impact the game . he had three hits , two blocked###shots and strong###defensive plays . he 's one of those guys that fits in seamlessly , chicago coach joel###quenneville said . he 's very aware of what his role is , what the expectations of him are and fulfilling anything that can contribute to a team 's success . handzus has moved to the second line with the prolific scorers patrick###sharp and patrick###kane . yet handzus has been anything but a passenger , consistently making offensive plays , winning face###offs and providing a steadying presence on defense . in his last deep , successful playoff###run with the philadelphia###flyers in , he turned in a similar###performance while skating primarily on the fourth line with the enforcer donald###brashear and the checking forward radovan somik . it does n't matter where you play , handzus said . you do n't###complain , you play . you make your mark , for the team . whether on the fourth line or the first , in practice or in games , handzus carries the same workmanlike approach . that consistency across all situations was on display in game 2 when handzus slid across the ice powerfully to close a sizable gap and absorb a slava voynov slap###shot into his midsection . at the time , the blackhawks had a nearly insurmountable 4 1 lead in the final###moments of their victory . he does things the right way , all of the time , every day so he gets into a game situation and it 's an instinctive part of his game , murray said . the influence of handzus goes deeper than his direct ties to the kings and the blackhawks . handzus also helped###develop his blackhawks linemate patrick###sharp and kings forwards mike###richards , jeff###carter and justin###williams as members of the flyers early in their careers . sharp remembered handzus 's strong example in philadelphia and said that he had set it again in short order with chicago . he 's a guy that can play in every situation , sharp said . he has an offensive touch that he probably does n't get enough credit for . he 's good on face###offs , can play defensively , can play special teams . but the thing he 's added to our team more than anything is leadership . he says the right things at the right time . murray said handzus 's presence was similar to having an extra coach on staff in los###angeles . he was very observant about team play , murray said . he had great###ideas , great suggestions and strong###opinions on how things should be . i listened to him very closely . my final year in l.a. , he was a player that i missed greatly . handzus can play center or left###wing and in all situations . along with his versatility , he has remained a sought after commodity thanks to his preternatural on ice awareness , long reach , sound positioning and his consistent preparation , all of which set strong examples for his teammates . murray and quenneville praised him as always being in the right spot and there was ubiquitous appreciation of his effectiveness with younger players . michal is great to learn from , blackhawks forward marcus kruger , 23 , said . you can look at him , how professional in everything he does . handzus acknowledged that this could be his last deep playoff###run , although he said he approached it with the same intensity he did as a 27 year old with philadelphia . whenever he does retire , his former coaches seemed to agree that he had a bright future in hockey . i think if michal handzus wants to be a coach , he 'll step right in and do a great job at it , murray said . i have visions of him going back to slovakia and being the head of the hockey federation in slovakia . he has that kind of ability to see the big###picture and to know what it takes in order for a program to develop young###players all the way through from the beginning of hockey to the olympic team .
st . petersburg , fla . at age 37 with cranky knees , alfonso###soriano is not nearly as swift as he once was . in an earlier life with the yankees in his middle 20s , soriano was able to rely on sheer speed and agility as he twice recorded seasons with 40 stolen###bases . now , stolen###bases come more from his mind and the knowledge he has accrued in 15 years in the major###leagues , and few were as critical as the one he swiped in the 11th inning sunday that led directly to a vital 3 2 victory over the tampa###bay###rays . summoning every bit of information about the craft of base stealing that he had gleaned from his previous 365 attempts and with his manager 's blessing soriano set out on an 85 foot sprint that changed the course of the game , and perhaps the yankees' playoff###hopes . soriano , who had reached on a one out double , stole third to put himself in position to score on curtis###granderson 's sacrifice###fly . mariano###rivera retired the rays in order in the 11th , even getting the dangerous evan###longoria , as the yankees salvaged the finale of a three game series . they moved to three and a half games behind the oakland###athletics for the second american###league wild###card spot , but it was all made possible by a stolen###base that involved many more subtle components than just a guy running fast , or semi###fast . longoria 's third home###run of the series tied the score at 2 2 in the sixth , and that was where the score remained until soriano started things in motion with a one out double off rays relief###pitcher jamey###wright . he was already in scoring###position , and a well placed single from granderson could bring him home with the go ahead run . but if he could get to third , still with only one out , even a deep fly ball would give him the opportunity to score . being tagged out , though , would be a crushing blow to the yankees , who were facing the possibility of a three game sweep at the hands of the rays , who had won 16 of the previous 21 games at tropicana###field . with the yankees down to 32 games on their regular###season###schedule , the time had come to take big chances . you get in some of these tight games , you 're going to have to do something , manager joe###girardi said . we tried to do some things , and it worked out . aware of the risk involved and the fact that soriano is not the base stealer he used to be , girardi still gave him the green###light a hand###signal relayed from the dugout to the third base coach , rob thomson , and then to soriano at second . if the opportunity###arose , he should attempt the calculated gamble . and it was not just a matter of player 's choice . along with the green###light comes a hope , even an expectation from girardi , to be aggressive but not reckless . that 's what i tell my guys , girardi said . i tell them , if i give you the green###light , i want you to get to the next base if you can . now it was up to soriano to assess the situation and determine whether he could make the move successfully . as granderson came to the plate , soriano was already thinking he would go . wright is not fast in his delivery to the plate , a big advantage to soriano . his first inclination was to see one pitch , and then go . but then wright looked over his shoulder at soriano once , and then a second time . that was it . sometimes , pitchers , when they look twice , they do n't want to look three times , he said . all he had to do was make sure that wright was not going to make an inside pickoff move . once wright was committed to going to the plate , soriano broke . it was not a great jump . at first , it appeared that catcher jose lobaton would have an easy chance to get soriano , who admitted he did not get a good jump . girardi said he did not think it was very good either , and for an instant , soriano froze . i kind of went , uh oh , girardi said . but he 's a base stealer . he does n't have fear and he has an idea what he 's doing . making###matters###worse , soriano stumbled as he broke . granderson thought soriano had a good jump , so instead of swinging , he let the pitch go to allow soriano to get in safely . as soriano came sliding headlong into third , lobaton 's throw was chest high . longoria caught it and put down the tag as all eyes turned to the third base###umpire , jerry meals . he immediately signaled soriano safe . now it was up to granderson . the rays employed their infield shift , but granderson refused to take the bait . instead of trying to shoot a ball into left , he stuck with the plan and lifted a perfect fly ball to right . if you try to do something you are not accustomed to doing , you get yourself out of whack , he said . soriano trotted home easily , and the yankees had the lead for good , stealing a game they simply could not afford to lose . mariano###rivera recorded his 38th save and the 37th of his career at tropicana###field . although it was his final###regular###season###game here , he did not get maudlin about it . you do n't see me crying , he said . ... alex###rodriguez pinch hit in the 10th inning sunday and singled , but he was doubled off second base . ... derek###jeter is expected to meet the team on monday in toronto after recovering from a right calf strain .
pueblo , colo . at first , angela giron was surprised to find herself in the cross hairs of a campaign to recall colorado lawmakers who had supported a slate of new gun###control laws . she had won her state###senate###seat by a 10 point###margin . her southern colorado district is heavily hispanic and reliably democratic , hardly ideal terrain to oust a lawmaker with mexican roots whose mother once worked picking beans . i thought , what the heck ? ms . giron said . why would they do that ? but over the summer , ms . giron found herself at the center of a citizen led recall campaign heavily financed by the national###rifle###association and other conservative groups and second amendment advocates , who have spent hundreds###of###thousands of dollars on advertisements and mailings to oust her and a fellow democrat , john morse , the president of the colorado###senate . in her fight , ms . giron has found support among liberal groups and unions across the state , as well as gun###control supporters with deep###pockets like mayor michael r . bloomberg of new york , who contributed , 000 to fight the recall campaigns . emily 's list , which supports democratic women who favor abortion rights , and new york 's junior democratic senator , kirsten e . gillibrand , have also sent fund raising e mails urging their supporters to help ms . giron . the campaigns have grown from a novelty into the central political battle here in colorado . fiercely fought and heavily financed by outside groups , they are widely seen as referendums on whether swing###state democrats can survive the populist reaction after supporting gun restrictions . on tuesday , constituents in this struggling old steel town will go to the polls to decide whether ms . giron should be ejected from office before her term is up . a former police official , george rivera , will be on the ballot as her potential republican replacement . mr . morse , too , will face a recall vote in his colorado###springs district , about 45 miles to the north . but even as national interest crested , ms . giron and mr . morse have tried to focus on local###issues . in a race dominated by guns , ms . giron has promoted her support for laws on juvenile###offenders and overtime pay , and how she helped###secure money for a new academic building at the pueblo campus of colorado###state###university . as the race barreled into its final###days , the two democrats and their opponents stepped up what has become an all out fight for every vote in the two senate districts , which have less than , 000 registered###voters . on sunday , 80 volunteers gathered inside a union hall in pueblo for their marching orders find supporters , and get them to the polls . after thanking everyone , ms . giron , clipboard in hand , set out for another day of knocking on doors and rallying support . i 'm a fast walker , she said as she headed out through a working###class neighborhood under a sweltering morning sun . but it was slow . most people , it seemed , were either at church or still asleep , so ms . giron scrawled her hellos onto glossy leaflets and wedged them into doorways . one man responded to her knocks by shouting , i already voted ! from his living###room . ms . giron thanked him , and moved on . she guessed she has knocked on about , 000 doors this summer , defending her pivotal support for new laws that require background###checks on private gun sales and limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds . she recalled one voter who approached her and yelled , angela , i 'm so mad at you ! i ca n't###sell my guns at the garage###sale . i thought , well , that 's a good thing , she said . ms . giron had never fired a gun before this winter , when colorado 's democratic controlled###legislature began an emotional and divisive effort to pass the state 's first new gun###control laws in more than a decade . despite almost unanimous opposition from republicans , democrats pushed###ahead with the bills , calling them a moderate , sensible response to mass###shootings at an aurora , colo . , movie###theater and at sandy###hook elementary###school in connecticut .

portland , ore . after portland had withstood a late barrage from the indiana###pacers and paul###george , the trail###blazers gathered at midcourt and raised their hands together . it might be early in the season , but this was a statement win for the blazers . lamarcus###aldridge had 28 points and 10 rebounds and portland downed indiana 106 102 monday###night , snapping the pacers' seven game winning###streak . damian###lillard added . it was a tough one , and we knew it was going to be a tough one going in , lillard said . they 're a good team , they only had one loss . but we 're a good team too , and we wanted to prove that . paul###george had a career###high 43 points for pacers , who own the nba 's best record . the blazers pulled in front early in the fourth###quarter , but the pacers kept it close and george hit consecutive 3 pointers that narrowed it to 98 96 with 37 left . lillard answered with a 3 pointer and nicolas###batum made a pair of free throws for the blazers before george hit another 3 pointer that got indiana within 103 99 with 21 seconds to go . lillard hit free throws and george made yet another 3 with 10 seconds###left to make it , but the pacers could n't get closer . portland ( 15 3 ) is off to its best start since the 1998 99 season . i really wanted to get this win , said george , one of just four indiana players to score 43 or more points in a game since . i was trying to will us into the game . both teams were playing the second of a back to back . the blazers beat the short handed los###angeles###lakers , snapping a seven game losing###streak to the lakers at the staples###center . the pacers ( 16 2 ) were coming off a 105 100 victory over the los###angeles###clippers on sunday to open a five game road trip . they 're a great###offensive team and they made big###shots all game long , indiana coach frank vogel said of portland . hopefully that 's what it 's going to take to beat this team making impossible shot after impossible shot . earlier monday , the nba named vogel the eastern###conference coach of the month for november . portland 's terry###stotts was named coach of the month for the western conference . the pacers went 15 1 in november and opened the season with a nine###game###winning###streak for the best start###in###franchise###history . the blazers went 13 3 under stotts to start the season , including an 11 game winning###streak . while stotts acknowledged it was a big###win , he stopped###short of the whole statement thing . we played the most complete###game from beginning to end execution , effort , mental focus . all of those things , he said . but i do n't believe you play statement games in december . george had a 14 foot jumper that gave the pacers an early 20 11 lead , but the blazers hung close through the first half . mo###williams , who helped portland keep up with seven points , had three fouls and was sent to the bench . the blazers finished out the first half with a 9 3 run to get within 46 45 at the break . aldridge 's dunk pulled portland within 59 54 midway through the third quarter , but george answered with an 18 foot jumper on the other end for indiana . orlando###johnson 's 3 pointer extended the lead to 64 56 and it looked as if the pacers were pulling away . but aldridge hit a flat 20 foot jumper and made a free###throw and joel###freeland dunked to even it at . lillard hit a 3 pointer and the blazers took a 75 72 lead , their first of the game . portland went up 86 78 on wesley###matthews' 3 pointer to make it . matthews was asked afterward what the win###meant that we 're a pretty###damn good team , he replied . it was aldridge 's 14th game this season with 20 or more points . the two time all star has eight double doubles this season . they 're good , aldridge said . i just had one of those nights . notes it was portland guard lillard 's 100th career game . he is third nba player ever to start his first 100 games . ... among those at the game was portland native galen###rupp , who won the silver in the , 000 meters at the london olympics . ... former blazers coach nate###mcmillan is an assistant to vogel in indiana . ... it was just the second time indiana had given up 100 points this season . ... the blazers are 8 0 this season against eastern###conference teams . ... indiana 's david west reached his , 000th###career###point in the second quarter . west , a 10 year veteran , finished with 12 points , eight rebounds and five assists . ... george hill matched his career###high with 11 assists . ... pacers starter lance###stephenson fouled out with just under 5 minutes left .
mattingly reflects on time with yankees don###mattingly , who returned to yankee###stadium as the manager of the los###angeles###dodgers , talked about returning to new york and his time with the yankees . don###mattingly learned about the weight of expectations while playing for george###steinbrenner during the bad years . the yankees won a lot of games in the 1980s , but not a single division title with mattingly . yet because of the way he played , he was beloved , more than many others in monument park . i came from a small###town , loved playing , came here and just played , he said tuesday . pretty much tried to keep it as simple as that , and they seemed to appreciate that . it was nice for me , because i did n't have to do anything but just play . the fans would have roared for mattingly on tuesday , his first day in uniform at the new yankee###stadium as manager of the los###angeles###dodgers . but the game was rained out , forcing the dodgers to play a doubleheader wednesday before disappearing again . they have not played in the bronx since the 1981 world###series . the yankees lost the last four games of that series , and steinbrenner brawled with fans in an elevator at his los###angeles hotel , or so the story goes . it was a fitting symbol for the stormy years ahead . mattingly , who made his major###league###debut the next september , would play for eight managers , from clyde###king to buck###showalter , with three separate###stints for billy###martin and two for lou###piniella in between . none of those managers could satisfy steinbrenner , who believed that the talent he had paid for just needed the right leader . now mattingly knows the feeling . the dodgers' owners , led by mark walter , magic###johnson and stan###kasten , are not as irrational as steinbrenner in the 1980s who could be ? but they have not extended his contract past this season , either . i kind of grew up , in a sense , with it , mattingly said , referring to pressure on managers . it still does n't really prepare you for when it 's on you . it does a little bit , and it prepares you that you just weather it and do n't take it personal and it kind of goes away , because it can only stay at that level for so long . either you get fired or you do n't , and then it kind of calms down . the arrival of yasiel###puig , a rookie from cuba hitting . 479 , has shifted the focus off the manager . the dodgers won four of their first five games after promoting puig , but they have dropped six of eight since . if the team cannot escape the national###league###west cellar soon , the mattingly watch will intensify again . the comparison to the yankees , baseball 's other 200 million team , is not flattering for mattingly . both teams have been battered by injuries , but the yankees are contending despite their recent struggles . the dodgers are 10 games under . 500 . mattingly came to the dodgers for the 2008 season , after losing the yankees' managing job to joe###girardi . previous managing experience , general###manager brian###cashman said this week , was the most important###difference . mattingly headed to los###angeles to serve on joe###torre 's staff , and became the manager for the 2011 season . the dodgers were 82 79 that year , but the dominant story was the financial war of their divorcing owners , frank and jamie mccourt . nobody expected much from the players , and mattingly recalled them fondly on tuesday . we felt like we did everything we could that year and we ended up like two or three games over . 500 , he said . but that club just kind of kept fighting and fighting and fighting . it was really a fun club to manage . that season , mattingly said , the dodgers had few impact hitters . their objective was simple pitch well and build rallies around matt###kemp and andre###ethier . he still sounds proud of those 82 victories . last year , under new ownership , the dodgers won 86 games and started###building one of those instant super teams that rarely seem to work . in one way , the owners were giving mattingly everything a manager could want . they traded for former all stars like hanley ramirez , brandon###league , adrian###gonzalez , carl###crawford and josh###beckett . they spent###lavishly on the free###agent starter zack###greinke and on international###talent like puig and the south###korean left hander hyun###jin###ryu . it has not meshed , and even with the injuries , the dodgers never envisioned last place . mattingly is easy to root for , but sentiment goes only so far . i think when you sign a deal and become a manager , you pretty much are going to get second guessed when things do n't go right , he said . they do n't###change teams , they change managers . so i just have to keep that in perspective with what happens . mattingly is widely###respected , not for his playing###career , but for his work ethic , honesty and everyman sensibility . but the dodgers actually have changed the team , presumably for the better , and the results on the field have been worse . managers rarely survive such a circumstance . as a player , mattingly saw the worst working###environment possible for a manager . he chose that profession for himself anyway , and found that it suits him . he can live with the pressure , in los###angeles or someplace else . i want to do a great job for our organization and do the best job i can , mattingly said . now , if they do n't think i 'm the guy for them , or the right guy , then i want to keep managing , i 'll say that . that 's for sure . i love what i 'm doing . even as tough as this year 's been , it 's something that i love .
east###lansing , mich . mark###dantonio does n't see michigan###state as a springboard for something else . the spartans' coach brushed off the notion that he could leave for another job . i see michigan###state as the destination , not a stop , he said tuesday . it 's flattering , but that 's the way i see it . the no . 4 spartans ( 12 1 will face no . 5 stanford ( 12 1 ) in the rose bowl on new year 's day . it will be michigan###state 's first appearance in the game in 26 seasons . dantonio is , and he is 63 29 with michigan###state over seven seasons . consistent with the stability he has built for the program , dantonio wants to keep his entire###coaching###staff together . that seems much more likely since defensive###coordinator pat narduzzi , the 2013 broyles###award winner as the nation 's top assistant###coach , withdrew as a candidate to become the coach at connecticut . it 's my hope to keep our entire###staff together , dantonio said . to have coach narduzzi remain here is a tremendous asset . narduzzi is often credited with helping the spartans rank among the nation 's top five defenses for three straight###years . they are ranked no . 1 overall this season . though the coaching carousel keeps spinning , it seems more likely that narduzzi will stay with the spartans . obviously , it was close , narduzzi said of a move to be closer to his roots . i would 've been an hour away from my mother in law . and i have a great coach 's wife . she could 've said let 's go , instead of saying what 's the best move for you coaching wise . the staff i have to work with here every day is the best in the country . i hate to break up the party we have going on right now . offensive###coordinator dave warner and quarterbacks###coach brad salem also drew###praise from dantonio , as did a senior###class that has won 41 games in the last four seasons . competing in its seventh###straight bowl###game , michigan###state will concentrate on the immediate challenge and worry about next season in . the spartans will say goodbye to three all americans , cornerback darqueze dennard and linebackers max bullough and denicos allen , plus three starting offensive###linemen . one star who said he will be back is sophomore defensive###end shilique calhoun , a third year player who was named the big ten 's top defensive###lineman . i already know i 'll be back , calhoun said . i 'm not going anywhere . i want to be a first team all american . and i know i can get better here .
with american###airlines' exit from bankruptcy on wednesday , the grunt work of merging the airline with us airways can begin and it will most likely be a long###haul affair , analysts said . it has already been a bumpy two years at american###airlines , which filed###for###bankruptcy###protection in november 2011 and expected at the time to speed through its reorganization and emerge as a leaner , independent carrier . but a far different airline is coming out of the process now , and if history is any guide it will face a difficult###transition as the two companies tie the knot , analysts said . of course it is very good news that new american now can finally proceed with the merger , but life is short and so are honeymoons , said vicki bryan , an analyst at gimme credit . previous big mergers delta###air###lines and northwest , united###airlines and continental have taken more than two years to be fully###integrated . southwest###airlines' purchase of airtran , announced in may , is still a work in progress . a federal court cleared the way for american 's exit from bankruptcy on wednesday , giving the go ahead for the formation of the world 's largest###airline . a central feature of the reorganization###plan was the merger with us airways , which had the backing of american 's creditors and employees . but the plan was temporarily disrupted after a challenge over the summer from the justice###department on the grounds that it would hurt competition and lead to higher fares . just weeks before the trial was scheduled to start , and after months of uncertainty , regulators and the airlines settled the suit on nov . 12 . judge sean h . lane , of the united###states###bankruptcy###court for the southern district of new york , found that the settlement did not modify the plan of reorganization enough to warrant a new vote by creditors and shareholders and said the merger could proceed without delay . american was the last of the legacy airlines to file for bankruptcy , stumbling from its perch as the nation 's top carrier after falling behind delta and united . american and us airways said that a combination was the best hope to provide travelers with a similar global###network capable of competing with delta and united . but american will have to work hard to convince passengers that a larger carrier can offer better and more customer friendly service . airline mergers are often marred by reservation problems and computer glitches . united , for example , suffered###repeated flight###delays and disruptions last year because of problems associated with its merger with continental . ms . bryan said it would probably take about two years for american to complete its merger . but she added that the airline would need to operate on a much shorter time frame to convince passengers and investors that it could actually deliver on its merger goals . i believe they have a chance to be nearly as successful as delta back in , she said . they really have less than a year once they actually close the transaction to convince the world they can execute as advertised . this means laying out clear and comprehensive planning , measured implementations , and sustained collaboration , especially with employees , she said , adding , united failed at this almost from the start and old american has n't had it for years . all this will be up to a renewed management team , led by us airways' w . douglas parker , to instill energy and fresh thoughts at american , where morale has been sapped by labor tensions in recent###years . the combined airline , which will keep the name american###airlines , will be based in the dallas fort worth region . it will have , 700 daily###flights , 1 , 500 airplanes and about , 000 employees . its annual###revenue will reach about 38 billion . american said wednesday that it expected the merger to close on dec . 9 . it said that the last day of trading for all outstanding securities , including those of its parent###company amr###corporation as well as shares of us airways , would be dec . 6 . once the merger closes , amr will be renamed the american###airlines###group and be listed on the nasdaq under the ticker###symbol aal . mr . parker has been a cheerleader for airline consolidation for years . he orchestrated the combination of america west with us airways in 2005 and then sought###unsuccessfully to merge the carrier with delta as well as united . after american filed###for###bankruptcy , mr . parker saw an opening to go after a fast merger despite the opposition of american 's managers . he made his case quickly , first with airline employees , then with creditors . he then persuaded the representatives of his rival 's pilots , flight###attendants and mechanics to all back a merger with us airways , provided that mr . parker would run the show . the vote , which crystallized the employees' defiance against american 's managers and what they described as a failed strategy over the years , proved a turning###point in the battle for american 's future . thomas w . horton , american 's chairman and chief###executive , initially outlined a plan for the airline to come out of bankruptcy as an independent carrier , but was eventually###forced to endorse the merger proposal once creditors supported it . mr . horton will remain as the chairman for a limited time . still , the merger has been criticized by consumer groups that fear that losing yet another carrier to a merger would lead to higher airfares and reduced competition . similar###arguments were raised in august by the justice###department when it sued to block the deal . as a condition for dropping their objections , federal antitrust regulators requested that the airline sell some takeoff###and###landing rights at reagan national###airport in washington and la###guardia airport in new york as well as divest gates and ground assets at five other airports chicago###o'hare international , los###angeles international , boston logan international , dallas###love###field and miami international .
next sunday at carnegie###hall , mr . levine conducts the met orchestra in what should be a revealing and rewarding program the prelude to act i of wagner 's lohengrin beethoven 's fourth piano concerto , with the pianist evgeny###kissin , who has given some of his most penetrating performances with mr . levine and schubert 's magisterial symphony no . 9 in c . this will be mr . levine 's first performance in over two years . on may , 2011 , the last day of the metropolitan###opera 's season , he conducted wagner 's walk re in the new production by robert###lepage , which had recently been introduced , and it seemed possible that he might rebound from years of spinal problems , shoulder injuries and surgeries . but in august of that year , when he fell during a vacation and suffered another serious back injury , his countless admirers wondered###whether he would ever conduct again . now he is finally###ready , as he anticipated he would be in an interview last fall . at carnegie###hall , mr . levine , who turns 70 next month , will use the motorized wheelchair he has been relying on of late . the met 's tech crew has constructed a special podium with a lift for the chair . this is a time to cheer the return of a musician who has been the most influential american conductor on the international scene since leonard###bernstein , an artist who for more than 40 years has made the met his home###base and , well , made the met the met . but significant artistic questions hover over the company right now . and even if mr . levine 's carnegie performance is a triumph , it will not resolve those issues . music###lovers everywhere surely hope mr . levine will continue to conduct often . but is he fulfilling all the duties of a music director at the met ? from all reports , he works regularly with singers in the company 's young###artist development###program , an essential training initiative he created in he also hears auditions and participates in artistic planning###sessions . naturally , much of what an esteemed maestro contributes to an opera###company takes###place behind closed###doors . but in the past , when mr . levine was working at full capacity , he redefined the role of music director in a public way that sent clear signals to operagoers and patrons . indeed , for many years his title was artistic###director , until , when he began his tenure as music director of the boston###symphony###orchestra and joseph volpe , then the met 's general###manager , notched down mr . levine 's title to music director an indication that mr . levine , understandably , would not be quite as involved as before . in his glory###days , mr . levine took a holistic approach to overseeing artistic matters at the met . not only did he rehearse and conduct operas , he cultivated singers , coached the young###artists , took the met orchestra to carnegie###hall for a popular series of concerts beginning in 1991 and , seven years later , inaugurated the met chamber###ensemble , which presented challenging programs of new and old music , mostly at weill###recital###hall . look , for example , at the 2000 1 season , not an uncommonly busy one for mr . levine . he conducted sizable runs of eight operas , including new productions of beethoven 's fidelio and verdi 's nabucco , as well as levine specialties , like debussy 's pell###as###et###m###lisande , berg 's lulu and wagner 's parsifal . in addition , with the met chamber###ensemble he played the piano in works by mozart and beethoven and conducted challenging scores by schoenberg , stravinsky , xenakis , cage and ligeti . here were terrific players from the metropolitan###opera###orchestra , along with their conductor , developing the musical intimacy that naturally flows from chamber###music . and in those days mr . levine was quite a pianist . that season he also made time for a concert with the orchestra at the opera###house featuring singers from the young###artist###program . late that spring he took the met orchestra , the chorus and star soloists to carnegie for a one two punch of programs verdi 's requiem , followed a week later by schoenberg 's gurrelieder . i have not heard a more insightful and exciting performance of either work since . and right after the season ended , he took the met on a long tour to japan . no one expects mr . levine to have comparable reach and stamina today . you can understand why the met wants to keep this master musician working in any capacity for as long as he can . but it is one thing to dispense wisdom and give exceptional performances it is another to run the met 's artistic affairs .
hoping to reverse two decades of declining oil###production in alaska , the state legislature in juneau has granted oil###companies an estimated 750 million in annual tax relief to increase###investment in the giant north###slope oil###field . the tax change , approved on sunday , was a major victory for exxon###mobil , conocophillips and bp , which had lobbied for years to repeal a tax system put in place by former gov . sarah###palin in 2007 that made state oil taxes among the highest in the nation . the companies have long claimed that high operating###costs and taxes in alaska encouraged them to move their investment dollars to other states with lower tax###rates , like texas and north###dakota , where oil and gas exploration and production have been booming in new shale fields . the alaskan economy runs on crude about a third of employment is dedicated to the oil industry . the state receives so much royalty and other oil tax money that there is no need for a state sales###tax or income###tax , and residents receive checks from the alaska###permanent###fund , a corporation largely###financed by oil revenue , that roughly totals , 000 a year for a family of four . but that largess is at risk . since alaska 's oil###production peaked in 1988 at . 02 million###barrels a day , the state 's output has steadily dropped . over the last two years , production has declined to , 000 barrels a day , from , 000 , even as national production has risen by more than a million###barrels a day . the new tax will impose a flat 35 percent rate on the oil###companies' net###profits and establish a series of credits and incentives that drive the rate down . this replaces the previous 25 percent base tax , which rose progressively###higher as oil###prices increased . the new effective###tax###rate could be as low as 14 percent , according to state officials . we are signaling to the world that alaska is back , gov . sean r . parnell said in a statement , ready to compete and ready to supply more energy once again . some energy experts caution , however , that it remains###uncertain whether the tax change can lift investment and production since offshore exploration still faces regulatory###hurdles and efforts to revive aging oil###fields on the north###slope will be expensive . the alaskan department of revenue has projected that the legislation will lower oil taxes by at least . 5 billion over the next five years , although changes in oil###prices and production rates could push that figure up or down . most democrats in the legislature voted against the tax change , arguing that it would force the government to cut more than 860 million to balance the budget in , when the tax change will take effect . the tax###rate had produced a windfall for the state in recent###years , because oil###prices were high . while other states were struggling with tax shortfalls , alaska was able to put away 17 billion in a rainy day fund . but oil###companies argued that the system was not sustainable . in recent testimony before the alaska senate###finance###committee , dan seckers , exxon###mobil 's anchorage based tax counsel , said that the current tax structure creates a major disincentive to invest in the high risk , high cost opportunities available in alaska . mr . seckers noted that even as the industry invested more than 1 billion a year in alaska 's fields , production had declined annually by more than 6 percent in recent###years . he warned that absent that continued investment , the annual###production decline would likely be in the range of 12 to 15 percent###annually . the decline in oil###production poses a serious problem for the trans###alaska###pipeline###system , by reducing the velocity that oil flows through the pipeline and allowing water to gather in the system . oil executives have warned that the water could lead to more corrosion , ruptures and oil###spills on the tundra . future exploration in alaska faced a serious setback last week when conocophillips announced that it was suspending plans to drill in alaskan arctic waters in 2014 because of uncertainties over federal regulatory and permitting standards . that decision came after shell oil 's decision to put off drilling this summer in chukchi and beaufort seas in alaska after it was forced to remove its two drilling###rigs from the area . the rigs were sent to asia for repairs after a series of ship groundings , weather delays and environmental and safety###violations during last summer 's drilling###operations . oil company geologists say they believe the chukchi and beaufort seas may become the country 's next great oil###field , with billions of barrels of reserves , but exploration and production will be costly . shell has already spent more than . 5 billion on its efforts , without completing a well .
houston al cy###young###award###winner david price pitched three hit ball for seven innings in his return from the disabled###list and desmond###jennings homered and drove in four runs as the tampa###bay###rays beat the houston###astros for the second straight night , 8 0 on tuesday . price ( 2 4 ) had missed the last 44 games with a left triceps strain in his first ever stint on the dl . but he showed no signs of rust , allowing a season low for hits with a season best 10 strikeouts . manager joe###maddon had said he 'd be happy to get six innings out of his ace before the game , but price was so efficient he got through seven with just 70 pitches . three relievers combined to finish the four hitter , a night after the rays two hit the astros . jennings , who finished with three hits , had a two run single in the fourth to make it 3 0 and his two run homer in the sixth pushed the lead to five runs . houston starter erik bedard ( 3 4 ) yielded six hits and four runs with a season high six walks in 5 1 3 innings . price had a tough time in his nine starts before the injury , winning just once in that span . on tuesday he looked crisp from the start , pitching a 1 2 3 inning before j.d . martinez singled to start the second . but he still faced the minimum through two after brandon###barnes grounded into a double###play . he struck out the first two in the third before a single by jimmy paredes , who was soon caught###stealing to end the inning . the 27 year old , who won 20 games last season , really got rolling after that , retiring 12 of the last 13 batters he faced with five strikeouts . houston 's only hit in that stretch came on a single by carlos corporan with one out in the fifth . the astros have been in an offensive funk lately , and have n't scored in 21 consecutive###innings . but that run was unearned , leaving them without an earned###run in 29 innings . they 've managed just four earned###runs over the last five games . tampa###bay 's evan###longoria had two singles in his return to the lineup after missing three straight###games with plantar###fasciitis in his right foot . the all star third baseman was tampa###bay 's designated###hitter against houston as he continued to struggle with the condition . he was replaced by a pinch###runner after his single in the ninth . houston had its best chance to score in the eighth with runners at first and second with no outs . but joel###peralta replaced jamey###wright , and he sat down the next three astros to preserve the shutout . yunel###escobar hit a two rbi double in the ninth and james###loney 's double sent him home to make it . jennings led off with a single before sean###rodriguez drew a walk . longoria walked with one out and tampa###bay took a 1 0 lead on a sacrifice###fly by wil###myers . bedard limited the damage by striking out escobar . loney extended his hitting###streak to 13 games with a one out single in the fourth###inning . jose molina walked before loney advanced to third on a groundout . the single by jennings , which sailed just out of reach of a diving jose altuve and into shallow right field , sent two home to extend the lead to . molina doubled to start the sixth and bedard was replaced by josh fields with one out . he was greeted by the towering homer by jennings , which bounced high on the wall in left###field , to leave tampa###bay up . notes houston 1b dh carlos pena returned to the team after missing two games following the drowning death of his nephew in the dominican###republic , but he did not play . ... the series continues on wednesday when houston 's bud###norris opposes roberto hernandez . ... houston optioned rhp hector ambriz to triple a oklahoma###city and recalled lhp brett oberholtzer from there on tuesday . ... the rays optioned inf ryan###roberts to triple a durham on tuesday to make room for price on the roster . ... rhp mark appel , the no . 1 overall selection by houston in the 2013 draft , will make his professional debut on friday with class a tri###city . ... the rays signed rhp ryne stanek , the 29th overall pick in the 2013 draft , on tuesday . he is scheduled to start workouts at the team 's spring###training facility in port###charlotte , fla . on wednesday .
( reuters ) newcastle united trio alan###pardew , mike###ashley and joe###kinnear have been the target of much criticism in the last 12 months but the manager , owner and director of football can look forward to christmas having steered the club into an unlikely title race . newcastle made it six wins from eight with a comprehensive 3 0 victory at crystal###palace on saturday to move within six points of premier###league leaders liverpool . flying high in sixth , it is a far cry from 12 months###ago when the club were mired in a relegation dogfight after a 7 3 hammering by arsenal which they eventually survived to finish a dismal campaign in 16th . that was followed by the leftfield appointment of kinnear in june with the irishman mocked after a series of gaffes in a radio interview where he mispronounced the names of newcastle players and officials and took credit for a signing someone else had made . pardew , though , said the current run of results proved things were working well . we 're in a good place as a club , the manager said in quotes carried by british media on monday . i know we 've had some strange opinions about us from outside but we 're working well together . the owner is really pleased , i 'm really pleased and , more importantly , the players are really pleased because if they are not you ca n't get those sort of performances . pardew was named manager of the month for november after his side picked up impressive###wins over chelsea , tottenham###hotspur , norwich###city and west###bromwich###albion after an indifferent start to the campaign . they followed that up with a disappointing 3 0 loss at swansea###city before recording a first win over manchester united at old trafford since . newcastle sit sixth ahead of home clashes with stoke###city on thursday and arsenal on sunday . with the transfer###window reopening on january , pardew is eyeing new recruits to sustain the momentum . that might be an opportunity for us to galvanise ourselves . i have n't really talked too much about the finance available but we 've###talked about players , the former southampton , reading and west###ham united boss said . we 're making sure that we do n't###miss what might be a key signing . you look at the last two january windows , we 've done good business . two years###ago , newcastle signed senegal striker papiss cisse in the january###transfer###window and his goals helped###spur them on to a fifth placed finish . in the last january window they recruited six players , five from france , to help them beat relegation . pardew said he , kinnear , ashley and chief###scout graham###carr were working well on finding potential###targets . we sit down and discuss and make sure we make the right decision for the club . the finance comes into that , of course , but so does selection of what i need . with joe 's knowledge of football he knows that the manager needs certain things and that has helped , in my opinion . i do n't really want to say any more than that but i think that gives you a little bit of insight .
i feel like i came in at the end of something great , tony###soprano told his therapist in the first episode of the sopranos , the series that turned a little known actor named james###gandolfini into the definitive postmodern mob###boss . tony would n't say what his business really was , and that gave his malaise a more metaphorical feel the fear of decline he described could just as easily have been about the nation 's best years as the job he described as waste###management consultant . it did n't take long to see that tony 's lament was also an inside###joke about the waning of the mobster genre . when the sopranos began in 1999 on hbo , it seemed as if all the great organized###crime sagas , like the godfather and goodfellas , had already been made and that whatever came next could only be tepid imitations of more lasting work . david###chase knew and did better . the sopranos was a transformative series for television it was the making of hbo and it helped shift the balance of creativity from networks to cable . and mr . gandolfini , who died on wednesday in rome at , turned the image of the old school mafioso upside down . tony became a totemic figure not because he was so special , but because he could be so ordinary , a typical###american dad trying to balance family responsibilities and the family business only his line of work was n't insurance or used cars , it was crime . one of the better comic riffs was that racketeering is like any other racket profits dwindle , employees shirk their duties , and younger prot###g s do n't know their place . tony was a mobster on prozac , the head of a crime family with mommy issues , a suburban dad who doted on wild ducks and killed people , sometimes just because he felt like it . he was a big tall bully with a disarming smile , a ladies' man who sounded as if he had waking sleep###apnea . that op###ra###bouffe in six seasons would probably have burned itself into the country 's psyche even without mr . gandolfini . the sopranos lowered the limits on violence , sex and profanity , and also lifted viewers' expectations , offering the kind of wit , psychological###insight and cinematic###style that until then had seemed the preserve of art films . but without mr . gandolfini , the series would certainly not have been as much fun . mr . gandolfini and edie###falco , as tony 's wife , carmela , were perfectly matched and peerless in the art of balancing high drama and low humor . mr . gandolfini said he thought of tony as a more violent version of ralph kramden in the honeymooners , but the couple 's ups###and###downs were n't always played for laughs . their most fraught marital battles were as intense and mesmerizing as any by edward###albee or tennessee###williams . the entire cast was superb , but tony , most of all , could say some deliciously foolish###things without ever becoming a clown . ( he once mangled the proverb about revenge being a dish best served###cold , saying , revenge is like serving cold###cuts . ) tony was n't the only mobster in therapy . analyze this , a comedy starring###robert de niro as a mobster who consults a shrink , came out the year the sopranos began . but in that contest between mr . de niro and mr . gandolfini , it was the small###screen actor who had more staying###power in the part . tony was the more intriguing character . even after so many murders , love###affairs , family disputes , disappointments and protracted dream###sequences , he was a low###class thug with charm and mystery . tony###soprano became a mythic hero in american culture , and that was hard for the actor to live down . i never think about him , ever , mr . gandolfini once told an interviewer . television , far more than movies , has a way of imprisoning its biggest###stars . hit shows last for years , and once viewers fall in love with a favorite###character , they do n't like to let go . carroll###o'connor was always archie###bunker daniel j . travanti never got out from under the shadow of his role as frank furillo in hill###street###blues and jerry###seinfeld is still the bachelor comedian hanging out in a coffee###shop with elaine , george and kramer . tony was at times a poignant figure , a made man at war with his own nature , struggling to not become the person we all knew him to be . when mr . gandolfini died , he was still working###hard to not be entirely defined by the role of a lifetime . the actor did better than many . he was an italian###american who seemed born to play a new jersey mobster he grew up there , in park###ridge . his father was an italian immigrant who worked as a bricklayer and a janitor , and his mother was a lunch lady at a high###school cafeteria . but he fought against type . in 2007 he produced and narrated an excellent hbo documentary about wounded war###veterans , alive day memories home from iraq , and made a point of keeping his distance from the camera and letting the soldiers do the talking . he followed that three years later with another documentary on the subject , wartorn 1861 2010 . his first major role after the sopranos was on broadway in . he played a father from cobble###hill in god of carnage . he channeled the former central###intelligence###agency director leon###panetta in zero dark thirty , a giuliani like mayor in the remake of the taking of pelham . he took a stab at political###satire , playing an american antiwar general in the british spoof 'in the loop . no other role ever came close to offering the complex contradictions of tony###soprano . behind the scenes , mr . gandolfini had his own share of inconsistencies . he was a fiercely private person who had a public battle with drugs and alcohol . he was a shy , quite humble actor who once described his physique in a movie as a jelly doughnut in a camouflage outfit . but mr . gandolfini went on a one man strike over a salary dispute that drove hbo to shut down production at the start of the show 's fifth season . ( his agents argued that he should be paid at the same level as other leading television actors like dennis###franz of n.y.p.d . blue and kelsey###grammer of frasier . ) when he returned to the set , mr . gandolfini presented some colleagues with personal checks for tens###of###thousands of dollars , saying , thanks for putting up with me . the series ended on a mischievously ambiguous note , building to a denouement , but then letting the screen go blank and leaving millions of viewers in the dark about whether tony lived or died at the restaurant table . mr . gandolfini kept trying to kill off tony###soprano and move on , and he will be best remembered for making that mob###boss immortal .
florham###park , n.j . geno###smith has made clear that he intends to be an upright , in the pocket , strong###armed quarterback in the n.f.l. , and when training###camp opens next month , he is squarely in the running to start that way with the jets . but what if smith , a rookie out of west###virginia , is unable to beat out mark###sanchez for the starting###job ? coach rex###ryan hinted at jets minicamp last week that there was some wiggle room , that smith 's athletic talents could enable him to find his way onto the field somewhat similar to how the san###francisco 49ers eased in their young quarterback , colin###kaepernick , a year ago . the jets' quest for offensive innovation has not died with the failure , and subsequent###departure , of tim###tebow . smith may not look , act or play like tebow , but there is a chance his role could start off looking similar . i know what everybody 's thinking , ryan said . did n't we try that last year ? he added i think certainly that 's a possibility . we 'll let this thing work out and we 'll see . it was likely that ryan was purposely being vague about the offense , as he was last summer , coyly dodging questions while portraying tebow as the trick up his sleeve . this year , the jets have a new offensive###coordinator , marty###mornhinweg , a purveyor of the west###coast system . that is the direction the offense is headed , ryan said . but ryan clearly seems impressed by smith 's athleticism . i think even the west###coast###offense you have mobile quarterbacks , ryan said . obviously with geno , i do n't know what he timed on the , but the guy can run and clearly has good mobility . after three days of minicamp , the jets' coaching###staff had no leading###candidate to start when the season opens sept . 8 against tampa###bay . david lee , the new quarterbacks###coach , said he had never seen a two man race so tight , and he heaped ample praise on both smith and sanchez . they wo n't separate right now , lee said , adding it 's an open###competition . the best guy is going to get the job . he acknowledged that smith had struggled picking up some of the technical###aspects of the offense if y'all knew the volume of stuff in his head right now , he said but sounded optimistic that smith would settle down after minicamp . he 's doing so well for what we 've given him , lee said . that 's why i 'm excited when he sits down , calms down in six weeks and he looks at the playbook again , he could come back and say , 'yeah , i know it . ' the new offense has appeared slower on the uptake . dropped###passes by the receivers drew the ire of ryan on tuesday , the first day of minicamp . running back mike###goodson missed wednesday 's practice because of a pretrial###hearing from a may arrest . tight###end options appear limited . santonio###holmes remains questionable to return from his foot###injury by the season###opener . it 's still early we 're in the installation phases , general###manager john idzik said . there is an orientation of sorts to our offense for the young###guys to the n.f.l . there 's a lot of factors going on . the bright###spot , it would seem , was smith , who was not exactly tickled by the suggestion that his role might initially be as a runner more than as a passer . in florida , he threw for the third most yards in broward###county history as a three year starter for miramar high###school . he added more than , 660 yards passing at west###virginia . i like to think my game is based within the pocket , smith said . smith , though , did clock in unofficially with . 59 seconds in the 40 yard###dash during the scouting combine , and while lee conceded that smith was not in the same lightning quick league as kaepernick or robert###griffin###iii , his mobility was evident enough . for a team that was hampered by offensive###line and protection problems as much as the jets were last season , smith 's speed might be useful . or it might be fun to see him freestyle a bit with the ball in his hands . if ryan can find a way to add a new element to the offense , he could be willing to try . i 've always been able to make plays outside the pocket , whether it 's running , picking up first downs or even a touchdown , or rolling out right or left and throwing downfield , smith said . i can use my athletic###abilities outside of it . that 's a part of being an all around player .
costa do sauipe , brazil juergen klinsmann was handed the task of trying to knock his country out of the world###cup when the united###states team he coaches was drawn against germany in the opening round of next year 's finals . i had a feeling it was going to happen , i saw it coming , said klinsmann who won the world###cup as a player with west###germany in 1990 and led them to the semi###finals as coach on home###soil in . the u.s. , who became the only team to beat joachim loew 's side when they won a friendly 4 3 in washington on june , face the germans in their final group g match in recife on june . you do n't know , we might need a win or a draw to survive and to knock them out , former striker klinsmann told###reporters . the draw pits him against his friend and his former germany assistant loew who took over from klinsmann following the 2006 finals . that 's one of those crazy stories football writes , said klinsmann . i had a feeling in my stomach we 'd get germany it 's one of the most difficult groups in the whole draw . it will be special of course , not only for me and joachim but we will also be playing ghana and the boateng brothers . it could n't get more difficult or any bigger . for me once the whistle goes they are just opponents who we must beat ... we are going to be prepared and we are going to be confident . loew said his relationship with klinsmann would have to alter ahead of the world###cup meeting . we looked across to each other and smiled , loew said of the draw ceremony . juergen and i have had a very good and close###relationship for a long time . we have always exchanged###ideas on a regular###basis but that will certainly change before the world###cup match . not only do we face the united###states and ghana but portugal and cristiano###ronaldo as well and that will be very difficult . half###brothers kevin prince and jerome boateng played against each other when germany defeated ghana 1 0 in a first round tie at the 2010 world###cup in johannesburg . the pair grew up in berlin and both play in the bundesliga , 26 year old kevin prince represents schalke 04 and 25 year old jerome is a champions###league winner with bayern###munich . they both played for german youth teams before kevin prince switched###allegiance to ghana .
in lower###manhattan , foley###square is humming with potential tales . lawyers are entering the courthouses nearby , federal workers are finishing up lunch on the park###benches , commuters are catching the 6 p.m . train . mundane ? perhaps , but to dave isay and the organization he founded , storycorps , each one of these lives could make for a fascinating story . mr . isay ca n't###hear or see them , though , because he 's inside the organization 's soundproof recording###studio in the middle of the square , where thousands of everyday people have talked about their hopes , fears , regrets , triumphs . in here , the lights are low and the temperature is turned up , as if the studio is primed for sharing . q . oral###history that 's what this is , in a nutshell , right ? a . well , oral historians might not agree , some of them . and to me , it does n't really matter what you call it . it 's really an opportunity for two people to have a conversation , like we 're doing now , sitting here in this booth with the help of a trained facilitator , and use the microphone to have a conversation you do n't normally get to have . the microphone kind of gives you the license to ask questions you do n't normally get to ask . out of this simple premise have come about , 000 stories about love , loss and other fundamentals , creating what mr . isay said might be the largest###single collection of human voices ever gathered . some of the stories make it onto npr 's morning###edition , where the weekly###segment has a reputation for making listeners cry . somewhat paradoxically , the group 's own story has n't often been told , and mr . isay and i have come to the booth to do just that , with 40 minutes for questions###and###answers , as typical participants have . npr listeners might be surprised to hear that the nonprofit storycorps , now 10 years old , has 100 staff members and an annual###budget of almost 10 million . mr . isay , 46 , once a public radio###documentary producer , is a full time fund###raiser . and storycorps is increasingly a media###outlet of its own , turning others' stories into content for its web###site and other mediums . ( the group just released its fourth###book , ties that bind . ) detractors say the stories are emotionally manipulative , but supporters seem to be far more numerous . one thing 's for sure there 's nothing quite like this in the american media . it 's an antidote of sorts to an oft bemoaned media climate that rewards celebrity excess , political###extremism and bad###behavior . it celebrates normalcy . while its npr airtime has given storycorps considerable exposure , the recordings are primarily for the participants and the people they wish to share them with , reflecting the notion that the project is , as mr . isay puts it , more about listening than it is about storytelling . the act of listening reminds people that they matter , he said , somehow managing not to sound trite or overly sentimental . q . you must learn a lot from the facilitators ? a . i 've asked , occasionally , do any of the interviews not go well ? the ones , the few that do n't go well sometimes are politicians . q . involving politicians or about politics ? a . no , involving politicians . because i think they 're just doing a script . and a script does n't work . among mr . isay 's inspirations for storycorps were the oral###histories collected by the works###progress###administration in the 1930s and the work of studs###terkel , who was present at the project 's inception and died in . at the ribbon###cutting for the booth in grand###central###terminal , mr . isay recalled terkel 's saying we know who the architect of grand###central was . who laid these floors ? who built these walls ? terkel told him those were kind of stories he should tell . we 've fought like hell in the intervening time to , you know , live up to what he asked us to do , mr . isay added . most storycorps conversations are between two people who know each other intimately a grandmother and grandson , say , or a newlywed and her husband in the army . ( that 's why some academics question whether storycorps is oral###history , which traditionally involves interviews by an expert . ) these days , there are daunting waiting lists for a 40 minute turn . the grand###central booth closed in , the same year the foley###square one opened . now there are studios in atlanta , chicago and san###francisco and a mobile booth that traverses the country . but the foley###square booth has been mostly shuttered since 2011 due to what storycorps calls funding challenges . ( the staff unlocked the doors for our conversation . ) storycorps 's principal source of financing has been the corporation###for###public###broadcasting , the group that disperses federal money to pbs , npr and other public media entities . it 's an initiative that smashes stereotypes , said patricia de stacy harrison , the corporation 's chief###executive . other sources of financing include foundations like the macarthur###foundation , individuals and what storycorps calls custom services , which lend staff members and equipment to businesses , libraries and other groups . those help pay for the harder to reach stories , those recorded with prisoners , homeless youths and others on the fringes of society . while the recordings are archived at the library of congress , storycorps would like to have them all be accessible###online someday , too . mr . isay said the organization is focused on creating more content and making sure that that content gets out farther . to that end , the pbs program pov has broadcast some animated###shorts based on the recordings and has a 30 minute special in the works for thanksgiving , giving the organization a presence on television . but mr . isay said he would never allow video###cameras in the booths . audio , he said , is the best medium for capturing emotional###moments . q . i 'm struck by the fact that you say storycorps is still in its beginning###stages . a . i think we 're just getting started . i thought of this , first of all , as a 10 year project . so right now we 'd be winding it down . and it was about a year into this thing when i began to , i think , fully###understand the power of this , like , very , very simple###idea and decided to devote the rest of my life to building it into something that i hope eventually in this country kind of moves the needle on getting people to listen to one another .
charlottesville , va . marcus###mariota and no . 2 oregon wasted no time showing virginia all that speed the ducks bring is more than just talk . mariota ran 71 yards for a touchdown on the ducks' sixth play from scrimmage , turning a third and 5 that had the crowd jacked up for a defensive stop into a demoralizing introduction into what oregon football is all about . they came out in a man free look and they all kind of ran with their guy and i just kind of hit it up the middle , mariota said of the play , on which he flared five receivers out , then ran a draw . he was virtually###untouched on the play . the guys did a good job blocking and the receivers did a good job blocking downfield , he said . mariota finished with 122 yards on four carries , and threw###two###touchdown###passes . de'anthony###thomas added three touchdown runs , and the ducks piled up 557 yards of offense in their first trip to charlottesville on the way to a 59 10 victory that looked frighteningly easy . still , it left first year head###coach mark helfrich with plenty to complain about , namely 11 penalties for 119 yards . obviously we will clean that up , helfrich said . the offense , which built a 21 0 lead in the first 32 , felt like it left a lot on the field , too . i thought we did all right , mariota said . there were some times that we slowed ourselves down with penalties and bad throws . if everything starts to click for us , like those first three drives , i think things will get rolling and we 'll be pretty good . thomas ran for 124 yards on just 11 carries , and the ducks , who gained a school record 772 yards last week in beating nicholls###state , looked capable of doing it again against a virginia defense that hoped to keep the cavaliers in the game . oregon 's up tempo offense did all its damage while possessing the ball for just 25 . as always , thomas said , their opponents faces' told the story . that 's the funny part . for the first couple plays , they 're out there talking , and as the game goes by , guys are just slowing down and you can see by their body###language and stuff , and that 's when we know we got 'em , the fleet junior said . virginia ( 1 1 ) came into the game riding a high after a comeback###victory last week against byu , the first since coach mike###london hired new offensive , defensive and special teams coordinators . defensive###coordinator jon tenuta 's unit , especially , seemed confident it would be able to slow the ducks down , but mariota provided a very early look at what it was up against . we knew they are fast and athletic , london said . we tried to practice the pace , but it 's hard to practice for that type of athleticism that they have . it is always a challenge when you face an offense like that . the victory was the ducks' 16th in a row on their opponent 's field , the longest###streak in the country . mariota finished 14 of 28 for 199 yards with touchdowns of 30 yards to bralon addison and 11 to keanon lowe . the cavaliers trailed 21 0 after 32 and never were able to sustain anything on offense . david watford was 29 for 41 for 161 yards , but threw###three###interceptions and fumbled once , and all four turnovers led to oregon touchdowns . i 'm just learning every week , and that 's all i can do , watford , a first year starter , said . virginia 's lone touchdown came on a 45 yard run by khalek shepherd . after mariota 's long run , the teams###exchanged punts , and when the cavaliers alec vozenilek punted again from his , josh huff deflected the ball out of bounds at the cavaliers' . three plays later , thomas went through the line from a yard out for the touchdown , and it was 14 0 after 45 . the cavaliers got their first two first downs of the game on the next series before watford rolled right , threw downfield on the run and the ball glanced off dominique terrell 's hands into the arms of terrance mitchell , who returned the interception 16 yards to the virginia . on the next play , thomas went around the right side and down the sideline , tight roping the line for a touchdown , and it was . shepherd 's touchdown gave the biggest###crowd at scott###stadium in five years reason for hope , pulling the cavaliers within , and when the defense held on the next two series , the excitement grew . but early in the second quarter , thomas ripped off a 22 yard run , took a swing pass 28 yards down the sideline and mariota hit bralon addison with a short pass that turned into a 30 yard touchdown . three plays . eighty yards . less than a minute off the clock . and the ducks were rolling again . thomas added an 8 yard td run in the third quarter , and mariota hit keannon lowe from 11 yards for a touchdown to make it , prompting both coaches to begin substituting liberally . freshman tailback thomas tyner made the most of his chance , carrying four times for 51 yards and two touchdowns , including a 31 yarder midway through the final###quarter . kevin parks led virginia with 60 yards###rushing , and jake mcgee caught eight passes , but for just 53 yards .

boeing reported a first quarter profit on wednesday that topped analysts' estimates , and it said the recent problems with the lithium###ion###batteries on its 787 dreamliner jets would not keep it from hitting its profit and revenue goals for the year . boeing 's shares closed up 3 percent , continuing a rally that began last month as the company devised a fix to the battery problems that had grounded the 787s since january . the federal###aviation###administration on friday approved modifications to minimize the odds that the batteries would emit smoke or catch fire . some airlines are expected to begin flying the innovative jets again in may . in a call with analysts , w . james mcnerney jr . , boeing 's chief###executive , said the company expected to finish modifying the battery systems by mid may on most of the 50 787s now in airline fleets . he said the company had started to make the changes right after the f.a.a . approved the battery modifications . in japan on wednesday , aviation regulators indicated that they were satisfied with boeing 's modifications and would declare the planes fit to fly as early as thursday . boeing has come up with a fix that addresses a very wide range of potential problems , said hirohiko kawakatsu , an air safety official at the ministry of transport . in that regard , we see no problems with the fix . mr . kawakatsu said he did not expect the ministry to ask for substantial additional changes to the batteries . japan 's approval would allow all nippon airways and japan###airlines to resume flights of the . together , the two airlines own about half of the 787 jets delivered by boeing so far . the ministry of transport indicated that it was waiting until wednesday 's conclusion of a hearing in washington by the national###transportation###safety###board on its investigation into a battery fire on a 787 parked at logan###airport in boston in january as well as the f.a.a . 's initial certification of the lithium###ion###batteries in . to date , investigators have not determined what caused the fire in the battery in boston or smoke from a 787 battery in japan in january . in its earnings report on wednesday , boeing said its first quarter earnings jumped 20 percent to . 1 billion , or . 44 a share , from 923 million , or . 22 a share , a year earlier . revenue fell 3 percent to . 89 billion from . 38 billion . that was partly because boeing had delivered only one , because of the battery problems , compared with five in the same quarter a year ago . excluding pension costs and other ancillary items , boeing said its core operating earnings rose 5 percent to . 87 billion , or . 73 a share , from . 77 billion , or . 40 a share , a year earlier . according to thomson###reuters , the average analyst estimate was . 49 a share . on wednesday , boeing also reaffirmed earlier guidance that it expected its core earnings to reach . 10 to . 30 a share , on revenue of 82 billion to 85 billion , for all of . using traditional accounting measures , including the pension costs , it expected earnings of 5 to . 20 a share for the year . the company said the cost of dealing with the 787 battery problems was partly offset by increases in first quarter deliveries of its highly###profitable 737 and 777 jets . cost###cutting also helped its large military business increase its profit despite government###budget cuts . boeing has never publicly estimated the cost of the battery problem , and its executives declined to provide any numbers on the earnings call . analysts have said the final###tally could be hundreds of millions###of###dollars after airlines are compensated . gregory d . smith , boeing 's chief###financial###officer , told analysts that the first quarter results included an estimate of the cost of redesigning and replacing the batteries , which he said was minor in comparison to the overall numbers . mr . mcnerney said boeing 's sales###contracts did not require it to compensate airlines for the disruptions to their schedules . but he said there were a few places where we 'll work with our customers , and there are a variety of ways we can work with them , that can ensure that the disruption does n't###hurt the operations more than it needs to . analysts said the compensation could include discounts on future jet purchases as well as cash###payments .
early saturday###morning , manager terry###collins explained that the mets would have to monitor dillon###gee from start to start , grant him extra rest when possible and show general precaution while handling his forearm tendinitis , which has flared up and pained him on a sporadic basis this season . collins left###open the possibility of gee 's going on the disabled###list at some point . hours later , there was gee , shutting down the washington###nationals , extending his midseason renaissance , looking limber to the naked###eye . pitching for the first time since june 22 the extra rest partly contrived to allow him to rest his achy arm gee provided six strong###innings and allowed one run as the mets defeated the nationals , 5 1 , at citi###field . he threw 85 pitches , and his forearm , which has troubled him this year between starts and sometimes during games , did not become an issue . as he continued to bounce back from a ragged beginning to the season , gee improved to 6 7 and lowered his earned###run###average to . 60 . the mets improved to 9 5 over their last 14 games . it seems like we 're playing with a little bit more fire now , and it 's awesome , gee said . the victory for gee was his third this season over the nationals , who are quickly becoming his preferred adversary . in his three starts against washington this year , gee has a . 96 e.r.a . in 13 other starts , his e.r.a . has been . 55 . injured or not , gee has been excellent since may , when he earned an impressive win at yankee###stadium , allowing one run in seven and a third innings and striking out a season best . gee has a . 48 e.r.a . over his last six starts , a stretch that includes that victory . and still , he seemed frustrated at himself after saturday 's game , upset that he could not go seven innings . i did n't###feel all that good today , but it went my way , said gee , who seemed troubled not by his forearm but by something more vague . i felt a little off today . i do n't know what it was . gee said that his arm , which has bothered him since spring###training , did not hurt saturday and that it seemed to be improving . collins said the mets would continue to look for any problems . he said he planned to have gee pitch last when the team comes back from the all star break , which would give him a week and a half to rest as the team embarks on the season 's second half . the mets cannot afford to lose another starter . though they added the exciting right hander zack wheeler set to make his citi###field debut sunday###afternoon from the minor###leagues this month , they continue to harbor concerns about the left hander jon###niese , who was found to have a partly torn rotator###cuff last week . niese has a follow up magnetic###resonance###imaging test scheduled for thursday that will help determine whether he will need surgery to repair the tendon . gee allowed his only run during the fourth###inning , when kurt###suzuki laced a slider to left###field for a two out run###scoring single . collins said he pulled gee after six innings because he looked fatigued after working through a few jams . as a whole , collins has seemed encouraged by gee 's continuing resurgence . i really thought the start at yankee###stadium shot his confidence as high as it can be , collins said . after the early nationals run , the mets' offense awoke to help ruin the right hander taylor jordan 's major###league###debut . john###buck tied the score on run###scoring single in the fourth . one inning later , the mets took the lead , with the help of some shoddy fielding from the visiting###team . after daniel###murphy reached second , marlon###byrd hit a sharp grounder to third baseman ryan###zimmerman , who let the ball carom off his glove toward shortstop . ranging into the hole , shortstop ian###desmond barehanded the ball and tried to throw out murphy as he ran toward third base . but desmond 's throw bounced off murphy 's body and into foul###territory , allowing murphy to cruise home . the mets , on the other hand , looked sure handed on defense . they turned three double plays , and david###wright made a nifty barehanded play at third base to stanch a seventh###inning scoring chance . and as they quieted nationals , the mets made more noise . kirk nieuwenhuis and eric###young jr . each recorded sacrifice flies , and marlon###byrd had a run batted in on his sixth###inning single . the top to bottom performance helped extend the positive###feelings floating around the club the past two weeks . the mets lost 9 of 11 games to start the month , prompting wright , the team captain , to hold a players' meeting june . wright on saturday joked about his motivational skills , but he suggested momentum could be built after just a few good wins . you laugh and joke around , wright said . you play a little more loosely . you let your talent take over , rather than trying to force the issue .
new york david###wright is expected to return to the new york mets' lineup friday###night in philadelphia after missing seven weeks with a strained right hamstring . mets manager terry###collins says the third baseman went through back to back workouts the past two days with pretty good intensity . wright , a seven time all star and the team captain , has a . 391 on###base###percentage with 16 homers , 54 rbis and 17 stolen###bases . going into thursday 's game against san###francisco , the depleted mets were 19 25 since wright went on the disabled###list aug . 3 . in other news , minor###league infielder wilfredo tovar will join the mets in philadelphia to replace shortstop ruben tejada , who broke his right leg in wednesday###night 's game .
washington lawmakers will return to the capitol on monday from a weeklong recess , facing a critical###juncture on immigration legislation and controversies at the internal###revenue###service and the justice###department that will test congress 's ability to balance its twin responsibilities of legislating and investigating . for president###obama , how those competing priorities balance out could mean the difference between securing a landmark accomplishment the first overhaul of the nation 's immigration laws since 1986 or becoming consumed by charges of scandal . invigorated by the uproars , house republicans are setting their sights more firmly this week on the i.r.s . and mr . obama 's embattled attorney###general . after weeks of trying to leaven the house 's growing investigatory zeal with serious legislating , house leaders and committee###chairmen appear to be giving themselves over to an expanding and aggressive oversight effort on the i.r.s. , the justice###department 's targeting of reporters , attorney###general eric h . holder jr . 's statements to congress on that targeting and the sept . 11 attack on the united###states mission in benghazi , libya . house leaders including speaker john a . boehner of ohio have acknowledged the risk if voters see the investigations as driven primarily by politics . but with the legislative season moving toward the routine task of passing spending bills , oversight appears to be the biggest splash that the house hopes to make . the senate , by contrast , plans to bring a sweeping immigration bill to the floor next monday , with the goal of passage by july . the bill 's bipartisan advocates express increasing confidence that they will have more than the 60 votes they will need . these so called scandals have not diverted us one iota , senator charles e . schumer , democrat of new york , said sunday on the nbc###news program meet the press . the white###house plans to keep the president in the public eye , concentrating on kitchen###table issues like the economy and the carrying out of mr . obama 's health###care law as well as on high###profile foreign###policy efforts . the hope , officials say , is to prevent congress from seizing a public agenda that has largely been set by mr . obama this year . republican investigators over the weekend rolled out what they called more evidence of i.r.s . mismanagement , including new transcripts of interviews with unidentified lower level employees suggesting that officials in washington pushed to give conservative groups that were applying for tax###exempt###status special scrutiny . a soon to be released report by the treasury###department 's inspector###general will also take the i.r.s . to task for spending tens###of###millions of dollars on conferences over two years . the reserved statements from lawmakers who over the past weeks withheld at least some judgment on the expanding probes seemed to give way sunday to a much more accusatorial posture . republicans pointed to new evidence that they said would extend the cloud of scandal into higher###echelons of the obama administration . as the last few weeks have demonstrated , congressional###oversight is not only a constitutional duty , but also a vitally###important check and balance to the obama administration , representative eric###cantor of virginia , the majority###leader , wrote in a memo to members . he added during june and the coming###months , the house will continue to hold the administration accountable . hearings before the house###ways###and###means###committee on tuesday and the house oversight###and###government###reform committee on thursday will open new fronts against the i.r.s . after allowing conservative groups to sound off about being targeted by the agency , the committees will examine its spending on conferences and entertainment between 2010 and . during that span , the i.r.s . held at least 220 conferences , at a cost of 50 million , according to the audit by the treasury inspector###general , portions of which the oversight###committee released . the committee 's chairman , representative darrell###issa of california , let loose a volley of accusations on sunday that seemed to end a brief period of restraint for him . he said washington officials had known of the flagging of applicants for tax###exempt###status but had covered it up during the presidential###election and allowed groups that were not a friend of the president to be disenfranchised through an election . my gut tells me that too many people knew that this wrongdoing was going on before the election , he said sunday on the cnn program state of the union .

washington ( ap ) orders for factory goods that signal business investment plans jumped last month by the most in more than a year , suggesting companies were confident about their business prospects . the commerce###department said on wednesday that orders for so called core capital goods , which include industrial###machinery , construction equipment and computers , rose . 3 percent in january from december . a sharp###drop in demand for commercial###aircraft caused overall orders for durable###goods , items expected to last at least three years , to fall . 2 percent , the first decline since august . orders for commercial###aircraft are volatile from month to month and can cause large swings in the overall figure . boeing reported orders for only two planes in january , down from 183 in december . orders for military###equipment also plummeted by the most in more than 12 years . the increase in core capital goods suggests companies are willing to expand their production capacities despite worries that automatic government spending###cuts will slow the economy in the coming###months . the fact remains that capital spending appears to be holding up very well , said dan greenhaus , chief global strategist at btig , a brokerage###firm . in fact , it appears to be accelerating . still , the jump in orders was not broad###based and occurred mostly in machinery and manufactured metal products . orders for computers and communications###equipment both fell , and orders for autos and auto###parts were unchanged . and even with the increase , orders have mostly just recovered last year 's losses . total core capital goods orders reached . 7 billion in january , just above december 2011 's level . several economists warned that orders were likely to fall in the coming###months after such a big gain . we do n't###expect businesses suddenly to throw caution to the wind , paul ashworth , an economist at capital economics , said in a note to clients . about 85 billion in spending###cuts are scheduled to begin on friday , and there is little sign that the white###house and congress will reach a deal to avoid them . defense###department officials may have slowed purchases in january in anticipation of the cutbacks . business investment plans have held up in recent###months despite the uncertainty surrounding tax and spending policies . core capital goods orders dipped . 3 percent in december but posted strong gains of . 3 percent in november and 3 percent in october . separately , a measure of the number of americans who signed###contracts to buy###homes rose in january from december to the highest###level in more than two and a half years . the increase suggests sales of previously###occupied homes will continue rising in the coming###months . the national###association###of###realtors said on wednesday that its seasonally adjusted###index for pending home sales rose . 5 percent last month to . 9 the highest###level since april , when a homebuyer 's tax###credit was about to expire . there is generally a one to two month lag between a signed contract and a completed sale . pending home sales rose in all regions , but just barely ticked up in the west , where a limited###supply of available homes was holding sales back . the increase was the latest positive report for the housing###market , which began recovering last year after a deep , six year slump .
early in the 20th century , two brothers discovered a nearly complete neanderthal skeleton in a pit inside a cave at la###chapelle aux saints , in southwestern###france . the discovery raised the possibility that these evolutionary relatives of ours intentionally buried their dead at least , 000 years###ago , before the arrival of anatomically###modern###humans in europe . these and at least 40 subsequent discoveries , a few as far from europe as israel and iraq , appeared to suggest that neanderthals , long thought of as brutish cave###dwellers , actually had complex funeral practices . yet a significant number of researchers have since objected that the burials were misinterpreted , and might not represent any advance in cognitive and symbolic behavior . now an international team of scientists is reporting that a 13 year re examination of the burials at la###chapelle aux saints supports the earlier claims that the burials were intentional . the researchers archaeologists , geologists and paleoanthropologists not only studied the skeleton from the original excavations , but found more neanderthal remains , from two children and an adult . they also studied the bones of other animals in the cave , mainly bison and reindeer , and the geology of the burial pits . the findings , in this week 's issue of proceedings of the national###academy###of###sciences , buttress claims for complex symbolic behavior among western###european neanderthals , the scientists reported . william rendu , the paper 's lead author and a researcher at the center for international research in the humanities and social###sciences in new york , said in an interview that the geology of the burial pits cannot be explained by natural events and that there is no sign of weathering and scavenging by animals , which means the bodies were covered soon after death . while we cannot know if this practice was part of a ritual or merely pragmatic , dr . rendu said in a statement issued by new york###university , the discovery reduces the behavioral distance between them and us . the research center is a collaboration between n.y.u . and the national###center###for###scientific###research in france . much of the fieldwork involved researchers from the university of bordeaux and arch osph re , a private research firm in france . in light of these findings and other recent###studies , dr . rendu 's team concluded in the journal , it now appears that a general reassessment of these early burial practices needs to be undertaken with the aim of furnishing new scientific arguments and evidence relevant to the ongoing###debate surrounding neanderthal symbolic behavior . eric trinkaus of washington###university in st . louis , a paleoanthropologist and expert on the neanderthals who edited the journal paper , said in an interview that the new evidence of intentional burials was very substantial and solid . he said he had visited the cave last year and gone over all the pros###and###cons with the team###leaders . asked if the evidence would quiet the skeptics of neanderthal burial practices , dr . trinkaus replied i certainly hope it does . indeed , they buried their dead .
london it appears to arrive as unerring , as uncomfortable , as the summer heat . a professional player###dies within hours of his first game of a fresh season . all the condolences in the world go nowhere near explaining how and why the fittest of sportsmen should fall with such frequency . when christian chucho ben###tez , the 27 year old ecuadorean forward , left the field after making his debut for the qatari team el###jaish on sunday , he seemed fit and well . he complained later of stomach pain , and was pronounced###dead at a qatar hospital on monday . a flurry of twitter messages followed , from one posted by the president of fifa , sepp###blatter , to those written by ben###tez 's best friends on the ecuador national###team . brother , why now ? wrote his ecuador teammate antonio###valencia , a winger for manchester united . this pain hurts so much , valencia added in another tweet in spanish , but brother we love you . valencia and ben###tez were born in the same year and started at the same club in ecuador , el###nacional . both followed a dream of playing in england . in that sense , they were closer than brothers . manageable injury prevented valencia from being on united 's tour of asia this month , but he began his comeback on monday with a preseason###game in crewe , close to manchester . playing there was probably the only way that valencia might find peace of mind or purpose in life . his limbs have been broken by kicks from opponents , but that is professional irritation compared with what happened to his pal . one moment they exchanged goodwill messages , the next his colleague had gone . qatari news###outlets were shambolic on monday . one reported that ben###tez had died in a car###crash , another that he had had a heart###attack after training . confusion remains . el###jaish 's web###site said ben###tez had not complained about any health problems after playing a full part in the club 's 2 0 victory over qatar sports###club in the sheikh jassem cup . but neither el###jaish nor the hospital where he died gave any official###account of what ensued . the player 's father in law , cl ber chal , said from ecuador that ben###tez had had what was thought to be appendicitis , but that he had developed complications that led to respiratory###arrest . they called me at 3 a.m . to tell me they had taken him to hospital due to stomach###pains , said chal , who , like ben###tez 's father , was a former ecuador national###team###player . when he arrived , chal continued , he was not seen to quickly . by the time he was admitted , he was no longer responding . this happened in qatar , he said , adding , my daughter is alone there . alone , and now a widowed###mother of four children . the fact that it happened in qatar , where ben###tez had moved on a 10 million transfer this month , will reverberate . everybody knows that fifa has granted the gas rich state of qatar the 2022 world###cup and that blatter has now said the 32 nation , 64 game tournament should be switched to winter . the notion that stadiums can be air###conditioned for the games is simply that . but a world###cup brings fans by the hundreds###of###thousands , and average summer temperatures of 41 degrees###celsius ( 106 fahrenheit ) in qatar might be deadly outside the stadiums . it is premature to conclude that heat played a part in whatever killed ben###tez . he was born in the andean city of quito , but he played almost 200 games in mexico , before and after his single season with birmingham###city . short and stocky , but fast and elusive , ben###tez could strike with either foot or his head . a birmingham contemporary , lee###carsley , described ben###tez as a player of outstanding ability , very quick , a bit of a free spirit . carsley recalled the ecudorean 's debut against manchester united as a substitute in august . he burst on that scene , carsley said . he took to old trafford like a big personality . he was very popular in the changing###room , but did n't really fulfill his potential at birmingham .
if there had been room in his camper , john###steinbeck once wrote , he would have packed all 48 volumes of the american guide series . compiled in the 1930s by the federal writers' project , part of the artistic wing of the works###progress###administration , the guides provided state by state accounts of local###history geared###toward tourists in cars . in the middle of the depression , the writers' project retained more than , 600 unemployed###workers , ranging from up and coming luminaries like saul###bellow and richard###wright to schoolteachers and ditch diggers , who gathered###information about their hometowns and spun it into legend . if w.p.a . workers leaned on their shovels , the writers leaned on their pens , steinbeck wrote . the brooklyn based composer and singer gabriel kahane has assembled an impressive collection of original american guides his current tally is 25 and his library helped him shape gabriel 's guide to the 48 states , a work that will have its new york###city premiere with the orpheus###chamber###orchestra at carnegie###hall next saturday . ( it had its world###premiere at dartmouth###college in hanover , n.h. , on april . ) commissioned by orpheus to write a piece on a w.p.a . theme for the orchestra 's 40th anniversary season , the 31 year old mr . kahane discovered the massachusetts and connecticut guides at a used bookstore and embarked on trying to gather a full set . i was immediately spellbound by the aesthetic values of those books and by their craftsmanship , he said in a recent phone###interview . as a liberal dramatizing the new deal , part of the lore of the american###left , mr . kahane worried about creating###music that was too preachy , but the guides offered a path beyond propaganda . you ca n't###escape ideology when you create your own historiography , he added . i thought that to let the era speak for itself through these texts would of course through their curation be political , but less explicitly so . for mr . kahane , allowing the 1930s to speak for itself involved reading the guides and transcribing intriguing passages into a massive document , which he condensed and edited into a libretto . gabriel 's guide journeys from california to new york , describing along the way the working###class in san###francisco the slave trade in washington , d.c. and the beauty of oregon . while orpheus plays his score , mr . kahane will sing and recite excerpts from the guides , accompanying himself on banjo and electric###guitar . the piece is a travelogue geographically and historically , moving fluidly from the early###explorers to the striking farm workers of the depression , tieing mythic past to political reality in the same manner as the original american guides . the writers' project was part of a four pronged plan known as federal one , which encompassed initiatives aimed toward employing visual###artists , writers , actors and musicians . harry###hopkins , roosevelt 's closest confidant , had started the w.p.a . in , putting millions of americans to work building###bridges , hospitals and roads . soon after , he introduced federal one hell , artists got to eat , just like other people , he said with support from eleanor###roosevelt . mr . kahane weaves hopkins 's voice into the guide , at one point reading part of his defense of w.p.a spending to a background of hushed strings . ( the piece 's long subtitle mentions the one and only harry###hopkins , intrepid new deal figurehead and hero , who really there ought to be a monument of somewhere , but there is n't . ) the writers' project might seem an odd choice for mr . kahane , given that his musical sensibility equally at home in the worlds of pop , musical theater and classical composition lends itself to the aesthetic of another federal one division . the federal theater project sponsored companies around the country to perform new shows for a broad , working###class audience in unconventional venues . employing the likes of orson###welles and kurt###weill , the theater project addressed topical###issues like the striking of steelworkers and the agricultural###adjustment###act , often in the form of living newspapers taken from headlines . productions tilted toward agitprop , which doomed it in 1938 when the house###un###american###activities###committee declared it new deal propaganda .
orlando , fla . kobe###bryant had a simple###message for dwight###howard before howard 's first game back in orlando . howard did , scoring a season high 39 points , grabbing 16 rebounds and tying his n.b.a . record with 39 free###throw attempts tuesday###night , leading the lakers to a 106 97 victory over the magic . his performance served two purposes it pushed the lakers to three games over . 500 for the first time this season and further punctuated how much the hapless magic miss their former franchise###player . even the lusty boos that greeted howard gradually###diminished as he kept pouring in points , most of them from the free###throw line . when orlando beat the lakers in the teams' only other meeting this season , at staples###center last december , howard was 9 of 21 from the line . but tuesday , he connected on , his confidence growing as the game progressed . i think he grew some , coming back and facing this , said steve###nash , the lakers' point###guard . the game carried enormous emotion for howard , who spent his first eight seasons in orlando , before demanding and finally receiving a trade last august . i came here a boy and left a man , howard said before the game . i 'll always love orlando and the fans here . bryant knew this would not be just another game for howard . nor would it be for him , but for different reasons . in a sprint to the postseason , every game is critical for los###angeles , which is 9 2 over its last 11 games . we 're very focused , bryant said . we know what we have to do and what lies###ahead . everybody 's locked in . this is the howard the lakers had hoped they were getting , but had not yet seen . his effectiveness and stamina have noticeably improved . he 's been 100 percent better , coach mike###d'antoni said . before , he could n't make two or three consecutive jumps . now he 's able to make multiple jumps . howard said i think i am getting a little bit better . i 'm just going to keep working on my conditioning , get my timing back and just keep going hard . in concert with this timely surge , the lakers have been an invigorated fourth###quarter team , a trait that had been lacking all season . we 're understanding what we need to do to close out games and win games , and that leads to chemistry , d'antoni said . everybody is accepting everybody . and we 're getting healthy , too . make no mistake , though , it is the chemistry that is deemed most important . howard , who never before had to take a backseat to a teammate , has openly feuded with bryant . howard has criticized the number of shots bryant takes while complaining about his own lack of touches . bryant has questioned howard 's toughness , especially his willingness to play through pain . it has not helped that howard has given multiple interviews in which he engages in the sort of self analysis that drives the no nonsense bryant crazy . howard also continues to make comments that draw distracting attention to the team . last week , howard , a free###agent after this season , said he had been text###messaging with phil###jackson . also , howard said his career in orlando was spent playing on teams full of people nobody wanted . the comment drew swift reaction from former teammates . it also ratcheted up the volume of boos for tuesday 's game . all the boos and stuff , i expected that , howard said . but nothing is ever going to stop the way i feel about this city .
a new study by the brookings###institution presents what the group calls an emerging portrait of young immigrants who have sought a temporary reprieve from deportation under a year old program that is one of president###obama 's signature immigration initiatives . the study###shows that the population of applicants , who must be between 15 and 30 years old , is heavily skewed toward the younger end of that spectrum most were under 21 and more than a third were younger than . in addition , two out of every three applicants for the program , known as deferred action , were under 11 when they arrived in the united###states and almost one third were 5 or younger , said the study , which will be released on wednesday . nearly three quarters of the applicants have been here for at least a decade . immigrants' advocates have long argued that many young unauthorized immigrants should be granted an expedited path to legal status because they were brought to the united###states as young###children through no fault of their own and , having grown up in the country , were essentially american in all but legal status . the brookings findings , the first of their kind , may well be used to bolster this case . if we think about what they 've done in their lives and how they 've###spent their time in this country , the fact is that they 've been part of the american school system , said audrey singer , co author of the report and a senior###fellow at brookings , a nonpartisan research organization . this is one of the big###things that makes them american . more than , 400 immigrants had applied for deferred action as of the end of june , according to the latest government figures , and nearly , 600 of those or about 72 percent have been accepted , with the vast###majority of the remaining applications still under review . the brookings study was based on a review of applications obtained through a freedom###of###information###act request to the homeland###security department . the data covers the period from aug . 15 , 2012 the first day applications were accepted to march , 2013 , and includes the first , 509 applications received by the department . united###states###citizenship###and###immigration###services , the division of the homeland###security department that has been processing the applications , has released monthly data about the program , including the number of applicants and recipients states of residence and the countries from which the largest subpopulations of applicants come . but the brookings study offers deeper statistical insight , including applicants' geographic###distribution , age , gender and year of arrival in the united###states . the applicants came from some 192 countries , brookings found . about three quarters were born in mexico , and the top 25 countries account for more than 96 percent of all applicants , the study said . the report also noted that only 4 percent of applicants were asian , fewer than expected , the authors said . china , for instance , does not appear among the 25 countries with the largest###number of immigrants who have applied for the reprieve . the applications have come from all 50 states and the district of columbia , as well as puerto###rico , guam and the virgin###islands , ms . singer said . most applicants , however , live in states with large foreign###born populations , including california , texas , new york , illinois and florida . but new jersey , which has the fifth largest###immigrant population in the country , ranks in ninth###place for applications , behind north###carolina , arizona and georgia , the study said . the volume of applications was at its highest in the early months of the program , peaking at about , 200 in october , according to government statistics . since then , the number of applicants has dropped###sharply , dipping to a low of about , 300 in june . ms . singer and her co author , nicole prchal svajlenka , a research###analyst , offer several likely reasons for this tapering . applicants with the most straightforward cases including younger people enrolled in school , recently###graduated , or living with their parents have an easier time showing that they have continuously resided in the united###states since june , one of the criteria for approval , and therefore may have applied earlier , the authors wrote . in addition , young people have more support than their older###counterparts through nonprofit organizations , particularly those that are working with high###schools and colleges , the study said . older applicants , especially those living###independently from parents , and those not enrolled in school , may have a harder time documenting that they have been living in the united###states continuously since .
washington the human###rights picture in many countries remained###deeply troubling last year , the state###department said friday , with the middle###east facing the harsh###realities of incomplete and contested transitions , russia and iran cracking down on activists , and many governments harshly suppressing both new and traditional###media . for countries undergoing wrenching transitions , in the middle###east or elsewhere , the way forward is much less clear than before , said secretary of state john###kerry , in releasing the department 's annual###report on human###rights practices at a briefing for reporters . it was a difficult year for nongovernmental###organizations , journalists and bloggers , including ordinary civilians using social###media , to vent sometimes daily complaints . the report said that 2012 was the deadliest year for journalists since at least and that the number of journalists in prison had more than quadrupled since . but the state###department report also highlighted a few bright###spots myanmar , formerly burma , which continued a move away from authoritarian###rule georgia , which had a rare peaceful transfer of power and tunisia , which secured some gains from its 2011 rebellion . some of the gravest challenges to human###rights , according to the voluminous report , came in countries where the arab###spring movement had once raised the greatest hopes . in syria , mr . kerry said , president bashar###al###assad was desperately clinging to power , responding to the cries for freedom with murder and mayhem . the number of deaths in the rebellion there soared to more than , 000 per month by last july from about , 000 per month in mid , the report said . using some of its toughest language , the report said the assad government continued to use indiscriminate , disproportionate and deadly###force to terrorize the syrian population into submission . egypt , a vital united###states ally , held contested and credible elections for the first time in decades . but there were also crackdowns on nongovernmental###organizations , a failure of security forces to protect minority coptic###christians from violence and increasingly targeted sexual###violence against women . the report appeared to be more critical than in previous###years of another important ally , turkey , which was identified as the country with the greatest###number of imprisoned reporters , 49 . while judicial overhauls had led to the release of thousands of people from jail , it said , the authorities continued to engage in arbitrary###arrests of opponents . the scene in iran , a perpetual dark###spot in the report , appeared no better in . the government there executed 523 people , often without due process . another frequent target in the annual###reports , china , again came in for criticism . the report said the government had made it nearly impossible to form independent groups that might challenge beijing 's authority , employing extralegal measures including enforced###disappearance . uzra zeya , the acting###assistant###secretary of state for democracy , human###rights and labor , called the situation in russia deeply troubling and said it had continued###to###deteriorate this year , particularly in regard to limits on civil###liberties , nongovernmental###organizations , the press and internet###freedom . asked about the treatment of detainees at the united###states . naval###base at guant###namo###bay , cuba , ms . zeya said , we hold ourselves to the same standards by which we assess others .
des###moines , iowa champions###tour players are used to seeing low###numbers in the principal###charity###classic . the results from the first round on the tournament 's new course suggest that those days could be behind them . tom###lehman , duffy###waldorf , dan###forsman and scott###hoch shot 3 under 69 on friday to share the lead at the wakonda club . the iowa event had been held at glen###oaks country###club in neighboring west###des###moines in 11 of the last 12 years . hale###irwin , who turns 68 on monday , topped a group of eight at . defending###champion jay###haas opened with a , and tour points###leader bernhard###langer had a . wakonda , which was built 91 years###ago , has more sloping fairways , higher rough and arguably trickier greens than glen###oaks . even though players were allowed to lift , clean and place their golf###balls in the fairways effect because of soggy conditions , low###scores were hard to find . the first round leading score was the highest ever in iowa and every player had at least one bogey . it 's kind of a mystery course , is n't it , waldorf said . you get out here on this course and you go , 'anything under par looks good' . the conditions led to a bunched leaderboard , which also featured four players tied for the first spot for the first time in tournament history . waldorf played the front nine in even par before a strong stretch put him atop the early leaderboard . waldorf birdied four of the next five holes including successive sand wedge approaches that landed within 5 feet to get to 3 under . though waldorf had to scramble for pars on the three holes , he was thrilled with his opening round . if you had given me 69 before the round i would have said 'oh yeah , ' waldorf said . forsman 's day was defined by an adventurous birdie on the par 5 13th hole . he hit his drive in the rough , followed by a 5 iron that whacked a tree . he punched his next shot over the green , leaving him about 70 feet from the hole . but forsman chipped it over a ridge , down a slope and into the cup . it 's a huge bonus , forsman said . and yet , when it goes in , i said to my caddie , that 's why we hit all those pitch shots this week . ' it was tongue###in###cheek , but i was trying to plug that into the subconscious , so next time i 'm in that position i 'll have a similar outcome . lehman had four birdies on the back nine , including one on no . 18 , to pull even with waldorf and forsman . hoch also birdied the 311 yard , par 4 18th , which ranked as the course 's second easiest hole , to reach 3 under . haas entered play with a chance to become just the third champions###tour player to win the same event four times . after a rough start , he put himself in position for a move on saturday . haas bogeyed three of his first six holes , and a 6 on the par 5 15th put him 1 over , but he closed with a birdie . langer needed birdies on holes no . 17 and 18 to get to 72 after a nasty double###bogey on the previous hole . david###frost , third in the schwab cup###standings , picked up six bogeys en###route to a 5 over . unknown doug garwood , who had played just three events on the web . com tour since , stunned the field by pulling into a tie for the lead after 14 holes . but garwood bogeyed the 15th and 16th holes and had to settle for a . des###moines avoided rain friday , but there 's a chance the course could see some light showers on saturday .
in an off season filled with uncertainty , the yankees passed the first phase with no surprises as three players turned down qualifying offers from the team . the yankees had made the offers set by major###league###baseball at . 1 million to robinson cano , curtis###granderson and hiroki###kuroda . the 10 other major###league free###agents who were given offers by their teams also declined them , and they are free to sign elsewhere . no surprises , general###manager brian###cashman said at the general###managers' meetings in orlando , fla . when we made the qualifying offers , we did not expect anyone to accept . any of the three could still re sign with the yankees , but if they sign with other teams , the yankees would receive a draft###pick as compensation . and if the yankees sign any of the other 10 who declined###offers , they must surrender a draft###pick to the player 's former team . the most likely to leave the yankees is granderson . they will try hard to re sign cano , who is considered the best free###agent on the market , and they are interested in bringing back kuroda if he wants to return . we will remain part of the process , stay engaged and try to re sign our players , cashman said . the yankees' off season plans are fraught with complications , starting with whether cano returns or signs elsewhere , and including the uncertain status of alex###rodriguez , who is fighting a 211 game suspension by major###league###baseball , which believes he used performance###enhancing###drugs . rodriguez is owed 25 million in , but if the suspension is upheld in arbitration , the yankees would not have to pay him , leaving them with a sizable amount to spend elsewhere . they also hope to keep the 2014 player payroll under 189 million to reap the benefits of new luxury tax###incentives , but only if it means fielding a championship caliber team . i 'm glad opening day is not tomorrow , cashman said . we 've got some holes to fill . without a commitment to granderson , the yankees are free to pursue another outfielder , including the free###agents carlos beltran and shin###soo###choo . beltran is the more likely target because he will be 37 next year and is not likely to demand a contract as long as would choo , who is 31 and is said to be seeking a deal in excess of 100 million . the yankees are also expected to go after brian###mccann , who rejected a qualifying###offer from the braves , though the competition will be stiff because many teams are interested in a left###handed hitting catcher . the yankees will probably also talk to scott###boras , the agent for jacoby###ellsbury and stephen###drew , who each turned down a qualifying###offer from the boston###red###sox . derek###jeter , 39 , is coming off a severe ankle###injury , and his status will not be clear until the season gets under way , which is why drew could provide some insurance in the infield . granderson hit more home###runs than any player in baseball over the 2011 and 2012 seasons . but he missed most of 2013 with two broken###bones when he was hit by pitches , once in spring###training and again during the regular###season . kuroda has had no contract discussions with the yankees , but he is expected to let the team know his plans after thanksgiving . he could return to the yankees , sign with another major###league team , or return to japan . cano , of course , turned down the offer because he is seeking a multiyear deal###worth somewhere around 200 million . he 's a premier player , cashman said , so given that status , those types of players dictate the dance steps . we 'll do the dance as long as we can . but at some point , you ca n't do that forever . we 're at the very front end of this thing . the music has n't even started yet . regardless of what happens with cano and rodriguez , the yankees are expected to go hard for at least one and maybe two starting###pitchers . one of those will be the japanese star masahiro###tanaka .

berlin less than 10 percent of people surveyed in the european###countries hardest###hit by the region 's debt crisis say that their leaders are doing a good job at fighting###corruption , a survey by the anticorruption group transparency###international has found . the results reflect a crisis of faith in government since the debt crisis crippled the economies of much of the euro###zone beginning in . the survey , released on tuesday , revealed a deep chasm between elected###leaders and the people they govern . about half of the , 000 people surveyed around the world said they viewed political###parties as the most corrupt institutions , and more than half thought their governments were run by special###interest###groups . jo###o###paulo batalha , a portuguese board###member at transparency###international , cited the near unraveling of the government of prime###minister pedro###passos###coelho in lisbon last week as an example of how focusing solely on the fiscal aspect of his country 's problems had led to the public frustration reflected in the survey . it has to do not with the amount of money that the government has spent , but it has more to do with the way the government spends money , mr . batalha said . there are huge conflicts of interest between the public###sector and the private###sector . there are huge problems with wasteful spending that is not just wasteful because of incompetence , but because of corruption . this year 's global corruption barometer is the widest survey conducted to date by the international corruption monitoring organization , which is based in berlin . the group surveyed people in 107 countries . only 23 percent of those surveyed internationally believed that their government 's efforts to fight###corruption were effective , down from 32 percent in . in portugal , for example , only 8 percent of respondents expressed###confidence in their leaders' ability to fight###corruption . that compares with 21 percent in , before the outbreak of the financial###crisis . the mood has soured even in the more prosperous european###countries . only 11 percent of britons and 13 percent of germans said they saw their governments as effective in fighting###corruption , both well below the global average of 22 percent . corruption remains rampant in many of the world 's developing###countries , where most people surveyed said they had to pay###bribes to receive public###services . but the wealthier economic powers were not immune . in many countries , there are no clear lobby regulations , said miklos marschall , a director at transparency###international , who called on european###countries to establish more precise codes of conduct and clear ethics declarations . nineteen out of 25 european###countries do not regulate lobbying at all . across the globe , 51 percent of people surveyed saw political###parties in their countries as the most corrupt institutions , followed by the police and the judiciary . the news###media did not fare as badly in most countries , but in australia and britain they were seen as the most corrupt institution , standing much lower in respondents' eyes than three years###ago , reflecting a series of recent scandals involving phone###hacking and other misbehavior by reporters and editors .

jeff mathews has set 44 cornell and 17 conference###records , more than any other quarterback in ivy###league history . entering this season , he was projected by some analysts as a mid to late round n.f.l . draft###pick , and professional scouts have been attending his games since his sophomore year , a rarity for a player in the league . yet in a season in which mathews , who has a quick###release and a gunslinger 's arm , was expected to pad his statistics against middling competition , he has struggled , at times , while his 6 foot , 229 pound body has been battered . last weekend , he missed cornell 's 24 9 victory over columbia because of a concussion . he has been sacked 29 times in eight games this season and 132 times in his college###career . before his final###game saturday , at pennsylvania , he will probably talk with his sister , katie , a vocal supporter and inspiration for him through this 2 7 season and other trying stretches of his career . in , katie mathews broke her neck and sustained###injuries to her spinal###cord in an automobile accident that left her a quadriplegic . it 's tough to go to her with a problem because i understand the problem i 'm going through is nothing like what she faces , mathews said . she knows what to say to help me get through a lot of different situations . mathews 's pro prospects were hard to fathom five years###ago . in high###school in camarillo , calif . , he was not offered a scholarship by any football###bowl###subdivision team . at cornell , he immediately wanted to prove his worth to the programs that passed him over . when he showed up on his visit , he said , 'great , which room do i watch film in ? ' cornell coach david###archer said . the intangible love of football is the first thing you noticed . mathews , who said he has dreamed of playing in the n.f.l . since he was a child , entered his freshman season as a reserve , but the starter , adam currie , broke his arm two plays into cornell 's first game of , against wagner . with injuries affecting two other quarterbacks , mathews was thrust into duty . for the next four years , cornell had its man behind center . a high###point for mathews came in his sophomore###season , when he threw for a combined , 069 yards and 10 touchdowns in victories against columbia and penn in the final two games . after those contests , katie called and they talked about his accomplishments , but the statistics meant little to him . every time we talk to each other , i 'm always so excited about the records he 's broken , katie said , and after i get all my excitement over , he just stops me and says , 'katie , that sounds great and all , but i want to hear about you . ' she was 16 when she was traveling in the front passenger###seat of a friend 's car to a party in may . she called for directions and put the call on speakerphone for the driver . the driver did not recognize the exit in time and swerved sharply , losing###control and flipping the car several times . the driver broke her leg . the roof collapsed on katie . today , she lives independently in texas and travels the country as a motivational###speaker and advocate against distracted driving . still speaking of the phone calls with her brother , she said he always pushes the focus back on me . he knows what 's important in life . jeff mathews 's selflessness is also evident to his teammates and coaches . j . c . tretter , a former cornell offensive###lineman who is a rookie with the green###bay###packers , said mathews was extremely team oriented . this season , against teams with frequent blitzes like princeton , mathews adjusted by throwing shorter###routes and screen passes , forgoing the long ball , which would impress the dozen plus scouts on hand , in hopes of a team victory . that 's all he 's ever wanted , archer said , to win football games for cornell . mathews said , ultimately , when you do n't###win games , you 've got to look internally about what you can do to make sure you 're playing better and giving your team a chance to win .
the phone###rings again at pasadena pawn and gun , and a familiar question comes down the line got any ars ? the answer is no . pasadena pawn and gun , a gun retailer and pawnshop 15 miles south of baltimore , is pretty much sold out of america 's most wanted gun , the ar 15 style semiautomatic rifle . since the massacre in newtown , conn . , in december , the ar , the military style weapon that the police say was used in the shootings , has been selling fast here and across the nation . before newtown , the rifles sold for about , 100 , on average . now some retailers charge twice that . at pasadena pawn , on the wall behind glass counters of handguns , are three dozen or so ar 15 style rifles . dangling from nearly every one is a tag that says sold . the ar , it 's kind of fashionable , says frank loane sr . , the proprietor . his shop has a revolving waiting list for the rifles , and a handful of people are now on it . the young###generation likes them , the assault looking guns . on one level , what is happening here and elsewhere simply reflects supply and demand . the gun industry has spent###decades stoking demand for the ar 15 and rifles like it . now , after the mass###killings in aurora , colo . , and newtown , president###obama wants to reduce the supply . he has asked congress for tougher controls , including a ban on what are commonly###called military style assault###weapons the senate###judiciary###committee held a hearing on gun###violence last wednesday . many enthusiasts are rushing to buy one of the rifles now , in case the president prevails . but how did gun makers stir up the demand for these particular guns in the first place ? the answer is a story of shrewd advertising , aggressive marketing and savvy manufacturing a virtual recasting of the place of guns in american life . with speed and skill , firearms manufacturers transformed a niche###market for the ar 15 and similar rifles into a fast growing profit center . when certain rifles and features were banned under federal law from 1994 to , gun makers tweaked their manufacturing specifications and introduced more ar 15 style rifles than ever . with ads celebrating the rifle 's military connections , they lured a new and eager audience to weapons that , not long###ago , few serious gun enthusiasts would buy . it might seem remarkable , given the national conversation about gun###control , but guns are a relatively small###business in the united###states . sales of commercial guns and ammunition as opposed to those sold to the military and police amounted to about 5 billion in . that 's less than half of the profits that apple earned in the final 13 weeks of last year . but despite the headlines , and partly because of them , commercial gun sales are growing . last year , they were up 16 percent industrywide , according to estimates from the national###shooting###sports###foundation , an industry trade###association . semiautomatic rifles like the ar 15 are responsible for a significant share of that growth . by now , many americans probably recognize the ar , whether or not they recognize the term . unlike its military counterpart , the m , the civilian ar 15 cannot spray a continuous stream of ammunition with one pull of the trigger . but , as a semiautomatic , it can fire individual bullets as fast as the trigger can be squeezed . by design , it looks and feels like something commandos might carry . that is part of its appeal , and of manufacturers' pitch . on one level , marketing military style weapons to civilians is not so different from pitching professional sports###equipment to high###school athletes . garry james , the senior field editor at guns###ammo , says a military pedigree inspires consumer###confidence in a gun 's reliability . credibility of performance is what appeals to the firearms enthusiast , mr . james wrote in an e mail . yet marketing combat derived weapons to civilians is a risky###business , particularly now . the industry itself has promoted the guns by using battle imagery and words like assault and combat . bushmaster firearms , a leading maker of ar 15 style guns , and whose rifles have been used in several mass###shootings , features the bushmaster acr , short for adaptive combat rifle , on its web###site . forces of opposition , bow down , part of the site says . all the same , gun makers say customers buy these weapons with peaceable intentions . the ar 15 is n't the first military style weapon to gain a consumer following . after world###war###ii , some people bought surplus german service rifles made by mauser and repurposed them for hunting and competitive shooting . but the selling of the ar 15 represents the first mass###marketing of a military style semiautomatic rifle made by a number of different gun makers . its success has led to an increasing militarization of the entire consumer firearms market , says tom diaz , a gun industry researcher and gun###control advocate . it speaks to the fact that there are a lot of young###men in the u.s . who will never be in the military but feel that male compulsion to warriorhood , says mr . diaz , the author of the last gun , a forthcoming###book on the industry . owning an assault###weapon is a passport to that . a remington###model , a classic pump###action shotgun with an all steel receiver and walnut stock , sits on a brown gingham tablecloth along with a slice of apple###pie , a mug of coffee and an issue of the old farmer 's almanac . this is how guns were marketed in . that year , the remington 870 was featured on the back cover of the july issue of guns###ammo , in an ad that emphasized quality and durability . the , the ad read . still as american as apple###pie . the front cover of the same issue showed something very different a photograph of two gleaming black rifles , with the cover line the new breed of assault###rifle .
fortaleza , brazil italy will hold no surprises for spain when they meet in the confederations###cup semi###finals on thursday , defender sergio###ramos said in assessing their first meeting since the spaniards dished out a###4 0 hammering to win euro . the odds look heavily in spain 's favour again . unbeaten in their last 25 matches , spain have only lost to italy once in eight meetings since the 1994 world###cup###finals , while italy have also lost mario balotelli , their main attacking###threat in this tournament . he has returned###home with a thigh###injury , but ramos said spain still expected a tough test at the estadio castelnao on thursday . we are playing for the final of a very important trophy with the###dream of appearing in a great stadium like the maracana , ramos , a member of the team that crushed italy a year ago in kiev to retain the european title , told###reporters at a briefing in a beachside hotel on tuesday . we do n't###expect any surprises , we know them perfectly well and we know that they will make it very difficult for us . they have the experience , a very competitive###spirit and they always show it even if their results against us recently have not been that good . i think it will be far more difficult than in the european final . we cannot relax for a moment , we want to win this confederations###cup on sunday , it is very important to us . fellow defender jordi###alba , who has had a fine tournament and scored two excellent goals in sunday 's 3 0 win over nigeria which gave spain their third successive win here added last year in kiev we played the perfect###match against them , in every aspect of our play . they gave us a lot of room and i am not sure they will make that mistake again , but if we stick to our game plan , which has brought us a lot of success recently , i think we will beat them again . spain 's preparations have been sullied by allegations made in the local###media that a number of spain players enjoyed a party with five girls after their opening 2 1 win over uruguay on june . the spanish fa , in a strongly###worded official###statement , denied the allegations on tuesday , while ramos said if the story was written to destabilise the squad , it had not worked . ramos told###reporters to put our reputation in doubt by inventing a story like this is very bad and i hope the law does what is merited . it is in the hands of the police . our consciences are clean , we are not here to talk about parties , we are here to play our game which has made us world###champions and champions of europe . brazil face uruguay in the other semi###final with the final at the maracana stadium in rio on sunday .
two former united###states open###champions , both strong###willed competitors and veterans of the spotlight , carried on late into friday###night in one of the most dramatic contests of the early###stages of the open . after a day of mostly tidy business as usual , the prime time matchup of sixth###seeded juan###mart###n del potro and lleyton###hewitt was highly###anticipated , even if it did not have the current brand name figures of the sport . it was still the charismatic del potro , the winner here in , and hewitt , a perennial contender whose backward cap and spunkiness fans have come to adore . their performance surpassed its billing . hewitt , 32 , from australia , outlasted del potro , 6 4 , 5 7 , 3 6 , 7 6 ( 2 ) , 6 1 . it 's an amazing feeling , hewitt said . i love being out in that atmosphere , soaking up every second of it . from the outset , both players seemed to nestle into their comfort zones . hewitt was serving to win the second set , ahead by , but he double faulted to bring the game back to deuce a severe miscue that cost him . del potro wound up winning the game and rallied to take the set , 7 5 . from there , it was back and forth , neither player sustaining momentum for more than a game or even a point . del potro struggled with his backhand , but his powerful forehand was crisp . hewitt , who won here 12 years###ago , played like the grizzled bulldog he has become known as . he 's a great champion and a great fighter , del potro said of hewitt . for the second round , it 's a really difficult player . two hours and 45 minutes into the match , it could not have been tighter both players had 105 points . after del potro won the third set , he fought off two break###points to hold serve and even the fourth set at . both players wound up exchanging breaks and the set went to a tiebreaker . there , hewitt played at his sharpest , jumping ahead , 6 0 , before winning , 7 2 . he committed only four unforced###errors in the fifth set , and del potro fell flat . i just kept fighting and putting it out there , hewitt said . i kept coming at him the whole night . i felt like i was seeing the ball well . felt like i played a good game plan . earlier in the evening , the defending###champion , andy###murray , became the highest###seed to drop a set at the open , and for a moment it looked as if leonardo###mayer of argentina could push the match to its brink . but the third seeded murray rebounded with a fourth set more typical of him , beating mayer , 7 5 , 6 1 , 3 6 , 6 1 , at louis###armstrong stadium . against the hard hitting mayer , murray made seven unforced###errors , while mayer was superb with his forehand and turned up the intensity of his serves , notching five aces . the match stretched well past two hours . i was a bit frustrated at points in the match , murray said . i was doing quite a lot of the running for a lot of it , and was n't getting quite as much depth on my returns . you do n't###feel like you 're dictating the match . it can be a little frustrating . top seeded novak###djokovic needed a tiebreaker to win the first set in a , 6 2 , 6 2 victory over benjamin###becker of germany . djokovic admitted he had trouble###adjusting to the winds and conditions early in the match , but it hardly sounded like cause for alarm . it was very tough , he said . it was a lot of unforced###errors , very windy conditions . you could n't really read and predict where the ball is going to go , so you have to be very alert . at the start i had difficulty with my footwork . but , you know , i won the set , and after that , it was much , much better . also advancing was no . 12 seed tommy###haas , who beat the qualifier yen hsun lu , 6 3 , 6 4 , 7 6 ( 3 ) . haas , 35 , is playing in the rare over 30 crowd , now enthusiastically joined by li###na .
east###rutherford , n.j . a week after he had plasma therapy for his balky ankles , nets point###guard deron###williams returned to practice monday feeling a shade closer to his former self . he added , somewhat sheepishly , an admission that sounded astonishing coming from someone playing###professional###basketball . i ca n't dunk , williams said . i ca n't###jump . even if i tried , off one leg i ca n't dunk . i can dunk off two , but if i just tried to dunk off my left###leg , i ca n't dunk . dunking is one thing williams , who is listed at 6 feet 3 inches , was never known for his leaping ability . but the nets hope he can get some of his explosiveness and lift back for the second half . williams missed the last two games before the all star game break to have the ankle procedure , an orthobiotic treatment that uses an injection of the players' own blood into the injured area to help the body repair . he practiced monday and said his legs felt fine , although he was not prepared to say the procedure had made a significant###difference . williams said he would be in the lineup tuesday against the milwaukee###bucks , but coach p . j . carlesimo said he was unsure about williams 's availability for the home###and###home###series against the bucks on tuesday and wednesday . i have no expectations , honestly , carlesimo said . i was n't sure if he was going to practice today . whatever they say is fine . if he can play , great . if he ca n't , that 's o.k . williams rested in miami while watching the all star game from afar for the first time since . this season , he has been bothered by ankle , quadriceps , wrist and shoulder discomfort . none of those knocked him out for more than two games , but they have hampered his ability to perform at an all star level . his statistical output averaging . 7 points and . 6 assists is down considerably from previous###seasons . he averaged double###figures in assists for four consecutive###seasons for utah before signing a 98 million contract to stay a net . on saturday , jerry###colangelo , chairman of the u.s.a . basketball###team , told the daily news that williams was not in the best shape and a little overweight last summer in london , when he won his second olympic gold###medal . though colangelo later clarified his comments , the critique seemed to sting williams , who did not respond monday . he refused to blame his injuries , but acknowledged that his ankles had been a concern . it 's definitely affected me , williams said . if you 're going into the lane , a hard jump stop hurts . any hard impact or hard move hurts . i do a good job getting it warmed up usually in the first quarter it 's great . then i go and sit down , and it stiffens up and it 's hard for me to get going . regardless , williams said , if fans expect him to produce the statistics he routinely put up in utah , they may be disappointed . it 's a different offense , he said . i 'm not going to be doing the same things and have the same numbers that i did in utah . but i can still have a great###impact on the game . it will probably not be above the rim . in late###november against the los###angeles###clippers , a dunk attempt by williams his only one so far this season was soundly rejected by blake###griffin . williams even jammed his wrist on the play , adding injury to insult . it was that kind of first half of the season for him . now the nets are hoping for better results . we just want deron to be deron###williams , carlesimo said . if deron is deron###williams , we 'll be fine . i do think if the treatment allows him to play with a little or a lot less pain , that will be significant .
lake###buena###vista , fla . bruce###bochy spent his first career in baseball as a catcher , his second as a manager . he has absorbed the crush of oncoming base###runners and felt the sickening despair of witnessing his own catchers' injuries in collisions at the plate . the way these catchers are getting speared , they do n't have a chance , bochy said wednesday . i think it 's better to be proactive before we carry a guy off the field paralyzed and think , 'why did n't we change this rule ? ' now they have decided to do so . in the first step to formally eradicating a thrilling but dangerous staple of the game and an emphatic response to the concussion crisis that has gripped other sports major###league###baseball 's rules###committee voted wednesday to eliminate home###plate collisions . bochy , the manager of the san###francisco###giants , and st . louis###cardinals manager mike###matheny , whose catching career was cut###short by concussions , made presentations to m.l.b . 's senior###vice###president , joe###torre , and some other managers in the morning . the committee eagerly adopted the guidelines in the afternoon . it was unanimous that it 's time , bochy said . it was very encouraging . i personally thought either through the managers or general###managers or the rules###committee , there would be a few more naysayers . but there was n't one . some former catchers , like oakland###athletics manager bob###melvin and detroit###tigers manager brad###ausmus , wondered how ingrained instincts could be removed from the game . base###runners strive to score , and catchers strive to prevent them from scoring . i am a little bit old school in the sense that i do n't want to turn home###plate into just another tag play , ausmus said . this is a run . this is the difference between possibly making the playoffs and not making the playoffs . it should matter a little bit more . in my mind , i 'd love to see something that if there 's a collision , any hit above the shoulders , maybe the runner is out . i do n't know how it 's going to pan out . mets general###manager sandy###alderson , speaking for the rules###committee , said the language of the rule and its method of enforcement were still to be determined . when the wording is completed , the rule will be submitted to ownership for approval in january , and then to the players union . if the union approves , the rule will take effect for the 2014 season . if not , it could be unilaterally imposed for . either way , change is coming , and a mentality that persisted for decades will be officially outdated . when i was growing up as a kid in philadelphia , it was a badge of honor , said los###angeles###angels manager mike###scioscia , a former catcher . you were expected to hang in at the plate , and the runner was expected to do everything he could to tag the plate . we 're going back 40 years###ago , but the mind set has changed a bit . scioscia , who was widely###celebrated for blocking the plate in his playing###career , was asked to recall his most vicious collision . he responded that he could not clearly remember the worst shot he took . i got knocked out at home###plate , scioscia said . i 've been dizzy . chili###davis absolutely hit me the hardest , no doubt , and i managed to find a way to our dugout . jack###clark helped me at home###plate i needed some help being taken off the field . i do n't###remember those , to be honest with you . the n.f.l . with many more violent collisions than baseball was slow in responding to the concussion problem , playing it down or denying it for years , at great cost , both monetarily and to the league 's reputation . baseball is less dependent on contact plays , but it has some inherent risks , especially for catchers . a foul###ball to the mask caused a concussion last summer for the minnesota###twins star joe###mauer , who announced last month that he would now play first base . the idea behind wednesday 's vote , alderson said , was to make the game safer without changing its essence .
the genome of a young###boy buried at mal'ta near lake###baikal in eastern###siberia some , 000 years###ago has turned out to hold two surprises for anthropologists . the first is that the boy 's dna matches that of western europeans , showing that during the last ice###age people from europe had reached farther###east across eurasia than previously supposed . though none of the mal'ta boy 's skin or hair survives , his genes suggest he would have had brown hair , brown###eyes and freckled skin . the second surprise is that his dna also matches a large proportion about 25 percent of the dna of living native###americans . the first people to arrive in the americas have long been assumed to have descended from siberian populations related to east###asians . it now seems that they may be a mixture between the western europeans who had reached siberia and an east###asian population . the mal'ta boy was 3 to 4 years old and was buried under a stone###slab wearing an ivory diadem , a bead necklace and a bird shaped pendant . elsewhere at the same site about 30 venus###figurines were found of the kind produced by the upper###paleolithic cultures of europe . the remains were excavated by russian archaeologists over a 20 year period ending in 1958 and stored in museums in st . petersburg . there they lay for some 50 years until they were examined by a team led by eske willerslev of the university of copenhagen . dr . willerslev , an expert in analyzing ancient###dna , was seeking to understand the peopling of the americas by searching for possible source populations in siberia . he extracted dna from bone taken from the child 's upper###arm , hoping to find ancestry in the east###asian peoples from whom native###americans are known to be descended . but the first results were disappointing . the boy 's mitochondrial###dna belonged to the lineage known as u , which is commonly found among the modern###humans who first entered europe about , 000 years###ago . the lineages found among native###americans are those designated a , b , c , d and x , so the u lineage pointed to contamination of the bone by the archaeologists or museum###curators who had handled it , a common problem with ancient###dna projects . the study was put on low###speed for about a year because i thought it was all contamination , dr . willerslev said . his team proceeded anyway to analyze the nuclear###genome , which contains the major part of human inheritance . they were amazed when the nuclear###genome also turned out to have partly european###ancestry . examining the genome from a second siberian grave###site , that of an adult who died , 000 years###ago , they found the same markers of european origin . together , the two genomes indicate that descendants of the modern###humans who entered europe had spread much farther###east across eurasia than had previously been assumed and occupied siberia during an extremely###cold period starting , 000 years###ago that is known as the last glacial###maximum . the other surprise from the mal'ta boy 's genome was that it matched to both europeans and native###americans but not to east###asians . dr . willerslev 's interpretation was that the ancestors of native###americans had already separated from the east###asian population when they interbred with the people of the mal'ta culture , and that this admixed population then crossed over the beringian land###bridge that then lay between siberia and alaska to become a founding population of native###americans . we estimate that 14 to 38 percent of native###american###ancestry may originate through gene###flow from this ancient population , he and colleagues wrote in an article published wednesday in the journal nature . a european contribution to native###american###ancestry could explain two longstanding puzzles about the people 's origins . one is that many ancient###native###american skulls , including that of the well known kennewick###man , look very different from those of the present day population . another is that one of the five mitochondrial###dna lineages found in native###americans , the lineage known as x , also occurs in europeans . one explanation is that europeans managed to cross the atlantic in small###boats some , 000 years###ago and joined the native###americans from siberia . dr . willerslev thinks it more likely that european bearers of the x lineage had migrated across siberia with the ancestors of the mal'ta culture and joined them in their trek across the beringian land###bridge .
gainesville , fla . it was a sloppy way to restore a rivalry that had lost its luster , but florida and tennessee were seeking basic answers saturday , and they emerged with simple truths . the no . 19 gators proved they had perhaps the nastiest defense in college###football , one that might carry them to the southeastern###conference 's eastern###division###title despite a dysfunctional offense that will now be without its starting###quarterback , jeff driskel . he was lost to a broken lower###leg that will end his season . the volunteers ( 2 2 ) continued to be a team in disarray , benching their quarterbacks twice and committing six turnovers in a 31 17 loss in the sec opener for both teams . tennessee managed one offensive touchdown , an 18 yard pass from justin worley to alton howard with 10 minutes to play , and 12 first downs in its ninth###consecutive loss to florida . driskel was sidelined on florida 's second possession after he threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown by devaun swafford . driskel was replaced by tyler murphy , who completed 8 of 14 passes for 134 yards and a touchdown . one man 's misfortunes are another man 's opportunities , florida coach will muschamp said of the quarterback situation , referring to murphy , a redshirt###junior who was seeing his first action . he kept drives alive with his legs and his arm . early on , tennessee was without its starting###quarterback as well , having announced a few hours before kickoff that worley was being benched in favor of nathan peterman , a redshirt###freshman . peterman making his first start , at one of the sec 's most hostile home fields lasted the first half , going 4 of 11 for 5 yards , and the decision was made to bring back worley , who finished 10 of 21 for 149 yards . tennessee 's band belted out its always rousing rendition of rocky top , and fans here at ben###hill###griffin###stadium sang along in full throated chorus . but the volunteers have become inept and irrelevant on the college###football landscape , stumbling to a 25 29 record under three head###coaches since phillip###fulmer was fired in 2008 after 17 seasons . i will tell you this , and i 've told you this before losing is never accepted at tennessee and never tolerated , tennessee coach butch###jones said . i 'm proud of our football###team . i thought they showed resiliency . they did n't###quit . they gave us opportunity to be in the game at the end . still , on saturday , tennessee faced a 17 7 halftime###deficit as it offered further evidence of its downward###spiral in a first half###filled with squandered opportunities and four turnovers . momentum was the volunteers' for the taking on the gators' first possession , when punter kyle christy dropped the snap and tennessee took over on the florida 15 yard###line . one play later , though , fullback rajion neal was drilled by linebacker dante fowler jr . , who knocked the ball loose and recovered the fumble . tennessee 's defense provided hope for an upset after that turnover , scoring on a 62 yard interception return by nickel back devaun swafford and sending driskel to the sideline . driskel 's right ankle and lower###leg twisted as he was hit while throwing the pass , and he motioned to the gators' bench after he tried to stand and fell back to the turf . but a 7 0 lead and the sight of driskel on crutches seemed to do little to inspire the volunteers , and the gators' defense staked its claim to being the best in the sec , if not the country , holding tennessee to 31 total###yards and 3 first downs in the first half . the gators' offense sputtered , too , behind murphy , although he did throw a quick pass in the flat that wide###receiver solomon patton turned into a 52 yard touchdown in the first half . in all , florida fumbled six times but lost only two , both of which gave the volunteers good scoring###chances that ended in interceptions thrown by peterman . the tennessee program 's reputation took a hit recently after separate reports that two former players accepted money while playing for the team . arian###foster , a star running back for the houston###texans , said in a coming cable###television documentary that he took money on the side while playing for the volunteers from 2005 to . tyler bray , a rookie backup###quarterback with the kansas###city###chiefs who played at tennessee from 2010 to , was among a handful of sec players recently accused of taking money . the off the field problems mirror the ones on the field . on saturday , the volunteers finished with 220 total###yards and rushed for only . worley and peterman threw###two###interceptions each . now add an unsettled quarterback situation to the list of unpleasant truths tennessee has to face . there is no panic , jones said . where we sit , we 're . there are a lot of football teams that would like to be 2 2 right now , and we have to keep things in perspective as we continue to build this football program and learn what it takes to play winning football .
jonathan martin and richie###incognito spent most of the season side by side , a pair of 300 pound men made rich from football , crouched inches apart on the offensive###line of the miami###dolphins . when the defense took the field , they sat on the bench in order of their position martin , the left###tackle , next to incognito , the left guard . they were as connected as teammates could be though they could hardly be more different . now martin and incognito are gone from the team , at least temporarily , opposites embroiled in a twisted controversy over hazing and workplace abuse . martin , a classics major who attended stanford and is the son of two harvard graduates , left the dolphins last week after an episode in the cafeteria in which teammates stood as martin sat , the last in a string of perceived slights . incognito , a 30 year old veteran with a reputation for dirty play and a history of rough behavior , was suspended###indefinitely by the dolphins late sunday while the team and the league investigated the matter . their unfolding saga is forcing the national###football###league to uncomfortably turn its gaze toward locker###room culture and start defining the gray areas between good natured pranks and hurtful bullying . for years , young###players in the n.f.l . have been subjected to a wide###swath of indignities straight from the hallways of high###school or the back rooms of fraternity houses . young###players are often expected to carry teammates' equipment off the field . they are sometimes forced to sing or otherwise entertain teammates on demand , left helplessly taped to goal###posts or asked to regularly bring sandwiches or fast###food to teammates . they are often called names incognito referred to martin , privately and publicly , as the big weirdo . in the glossy program sold at the dolphins' halloween night home###game , after martin left the team , incognito called martin the easiest teammate to scare . espn and the associated press , among other outlets , citing unnamed###sources , have reported that incognito sent threatening and racist voice###mail and text###messages to martin . many teams have a tradition of requiring rookies to pay the bill at an annual steakhouse dinner , with free###flowing liquor , where tabs run into the tens###of###thousands of dollars . one report monday said martin was pressured to pay , 000 toward a trip###to###las###vegas that he did not attend . in , dallas receiver dez###bryant paid a , 896 tab . everything tastes better when rookies pay for it , dolphins defensive###lineman jared odrick wrote in a twitter message on friday , accompanied by a photograph of a table of food , including bowls of shrimp and other seafood . most incidents come with the tacit , unsupervised approval of coaches and executives , who see the pranks as a rite###of###passage , a worthy bit of team###building and character strengthening . last year , martin and other miami rookies were subjected to deliberately bad haircuts at the hands of veterans . offensive###lineman josh samuda had his eyebrows shaved and his hair###shaved into a penis shaped mohawk . glad we 're such a first class organization , josh , joe###philbin , then in his first year as head###coach , said to a room full of laughing teammates , according to the miami###herald . but the hazing generally stays in the macho atmosphere of the locker###room . the dolphins' latest problems symbolized by two behemoth millionaire teammates turned archetypical opposites burst into the public in recent days , forcing the team to address the matter . i want you to know as the head###coach of the miami###dolphins , i 'm in charge of the workplace atmosphere , philbin said monday , declining to provide specifics about what led him to suspend incognito . if the review shows that this is not a safe atmosphere , i will take whatever measures necessary to make sure that it is . martin has not spoken###publicly , and neither he nor his agent responded to messages seeking comment . incognito fell silent after his suspension after initially using twitter to defend himself from damning news###media reports over the weekend . ( enough is enough , he wrote to espn 's adam###schefter in one . if you or any of the agents you sound off for have a problem with me , you know where to find me . bringit . ) players and coaches around the league generally defended the culture of pranks , provided they did not become overly###aggressive . those borders may be impossible to define .
chicago jose quintana took a no###hitter into the seventh before david###ortiz broke it up with a one out broken bat single , and the chicago###white###sox beat the boston###red###sox 3 1 on tuesday###night . jeff###keppinger hit a two run homer off felix doubront ( 3 2 ) in the fifth . alex rios extended his career###high hitting###streak to 16 with a single and rbi double , and the white###sox won for the sixth time in eight games . they 'll try to complete the sweep against clay###buchholz on wednesday . the left hander struck out five and walked two , and he had the fans thinking they just might be witnessing something special . the roars from the stands grew louder with each out as the game wore on , right until ortiz 's bat shattered on a bloop single to center with one out in the seventh .
you do n't want to see me after a rehearsal , said the mezzo###soprano alice###coote , looking stylish during a recent prerehearsal interview at the metropolitan###opera . i 'm sweating and disgusting . i have to sing while being physically active and rolling around the floor and leaping around with guns . i 'm getting fit again in this production , she added , referring to david###mcvicar 's energetic staging of handel 's giulio###cesare , which opens on thursday###evening at the met . ms . coote , 44 , will sing sesto , the vengeful son of cornelia , a role she performed at the met in 2007 in john copley 's production . mr . mcvicar 's production , imported from glyndebourne , was a hit in the 2005 season there . ( it is available on dvd . ) there are very specific , hugely demanding physical moves i have to do while making it look effortless , ms . coote said . she has gained a reputation for trouser roles like sesto . she has also sung hansel in humperdinck 's hansel and gretel , prince###charming in massenet 's cendrillon , the composer in strauss 's ariadne###auf###naxos and ruggiero in handel 's alcina . as an actor , she said , she relishes the challenge of playing men she was once flattered to learn that audience members did not realize a woman was singing . but she says she does n't want to be pigeonholed . i do male roles well and embrace it , but i am a girl , for god 's sake , said ms . coote , who has sung the title roles in carmen and the rape of lucretia . i 'm so ready to do the big female roles , like mary###stuart and jane###seymour in the donizetti operas , she said . i feel vocally and emotionally ready for those big diva roles . as an actor , i do n't only want to do young###boys . ms . coote is also an active recitalist , which gives her a chance to make her own artistic decisions . i am increasingly###frustrated by opera , she said , as i feel that as soon as i enter an opera rehearsal###room , quite often i 'm asked to leave my brain cells and personality and experience and depth at the door . the choices are taken away from me . the choices are given back to me when i sing a recital . i do have opinions , said ms . coote , whose spark comes across immediately in an interview . opera is hopefully a democratic process , but sometimes it 's a bit too nondemocratic . and this is very much still a male preserve . it 's still a man 's world . maybe that 's why i like playing men . her dusky , alluring voice is notable for its burnished middle###range and ringing top notes . she recently###recorded schubert 's winterreise ( wigmore###hall live , a song###cycle usually sung by men , as well as mahler 's lied von###der erde ( pentatone ) and elgar 's sea###pictures ( hall orchestra . in recital she often sings contemporary repertory , and in the met 's next season she will sing detective###inspector anne strawson in nico muhly 's two boys , which explores the shadowy side of the internet . ( it had its premiere in london in . ) other recent###projects include a disc of handel arias ( hyperion ) conducted by harry###bicket . handel is one of ms . coote 's specialties she imbues his music with an electric intensity and emotional###depth . she inhabits every role so completely , not necessarily from an intellectual point of view , but she becomes the character , said mr . bicket , who is conducting giulio###cesare at the met and has often collaborated with ms . coote . it 's a very emotional and instinctive way of coming at a role . it 's an amazing voice , as on the one hand it has a middle and low###register that sounds like it could be a contralto , then it goes up and up . she finds the right color . ms . coote is now in prime vocal health , although she has had difficulties , including hemorrhages on a vocal###cord that she said were worsened by flawed medical advice . all singers struggle at some point , she noted , adding we 're athletes , for god 's sake . anyone who has a long career goes through things that people never hear about , whether it 's mental , physical , emotional . singers often refer to their instrument as a third person entity , but ms . coote said i ca n't###stand calling it 'the voice . ' it 's part of my body , like my armpits or knees . she felt the calling to be a singer from a young###age while growing up in rural cheshire in northwest england , a daughter of two painters . she described her parents , mark coote and mary moss , as eccentric , reclusive out of the box thinkers . they both encouraged her love of singing when her mother was in her 50s , she learned computer skills and took an office job to pay for ms . coote 's training at the guildhall###school###of###music and drama in london . she dropped out but later studied at the royal###northern###college###of###music in manchester . ms . coote said that while she enjoys her many prominent engagements , she has made sacrifices to maintain an international career , including finding it hard to make time to see her parents and to sustain a romantic relationship . you have to be completely focused , and some people are lucky enough to meet someone who will accept who they are and what they are , she said . no one has come up to me and said , 'right , off i go round the world with you , ' or 'i 'll stay at home and wait for you to come back . ' no one has said that to me yet , and i hope they will . ms . coote is sometimes described as self deprecating , and she came across that way at a recent rehearsal with the met orchestra . but that does n't reflect any lack of confidence , she said . i can trash myself in a rehearsal because i 'm not where i want to be , she said . the summit of where i want to be seems like a mountain away , and i 've got to get there each job . daily life frustrates me hugely . music goes right past that , right to the core . i want to push that to the limits of what i 'm capable of as an artist .
kyle###okposo 's first career###playoff goal , with 7 minutes 37 seconds###left in the third period , lifted the islanders to a###4 3 victory over the host pittsburgh###penguins on friday###night , tying the teams' first round###playoff series at one game each . it was the islanders' first postseason win since april , 2007 . after a 5 0 loss in game , coach jack capuano told his players that all they needed to get back into the series was a fortunate bounce . the bounce came in the third period . okposo fired the puck wide of the net , but it caromed back to the crease , then rolled off pittsburgh goalie marc###andre fleury and across the goal###line . matt###moulson , colin mcdonald and matt martin also scored for the islanders , who rallied from an early two goal###deficit and spoiled sidney###crosby 's comeback from a broken###jaw . crosby scored twice in the first eight minutes as the penguins raced to a 3 1 lead . but they could not hold it . crosby missed more than a month and had a series of dental procedures after taking a shot to the face against the islanders on march . he returned to practice about two weeks###ago and wore a protective cage attached to his helmet friday . evgeni###nabokov overcame a sluggish start to stop 30 shots for the islanders . they will host game 3 of the best of seven series sunday . we 're in the series , okposo said . we just wanted to come out and let them know that we 're not going away . ryan###white , brendan gallagher and michael###ryder scored second period goals for the canadiens . milan michalek had the senators' goal . before the game , the n.h.l . gave ottawa defenseman eric gryba a two game suspension for his crushing hit to lars###eller 's head in game . eller had his head down when gryba hit him at the montreal blue line during the second period of the senators' 4 2 victory thursday . eller crashed face first to the ice and was bleeding heavily as he was taken away on a stretcher . he sustained a concussion and facial and dental injuries . eller was released from a hospital friday and was resting at home . blackhawks , wild 2 patrick###sharp and michael frolik each scored###two###goals , and host chicago beat minnesota to take a 2 0 series lead . patrick kaneadded two assists for the blackhawks . bryan bickell had an empty net goal , three nights after scoring the overtime###winner in game . devin###setoguchi and marco scandella scored for the wild , who were without goalie niklas backstrom . josh###harding , who started in goal for game 1 after backstrom sustained a leg###injury during warm###ups , started again friday . he finished with 43 saves . sharks , canucks 2 at vancouver , a minute from defeat , the san###jose###sharks dug deep . patrick###marleau scored in the final###minute of regulation and raffi###torres won it at 31 of overtime . vancouver even missed a shot at an empty net before marleau forced###overtime . ''i think it shows a lot about our team , '' torres said . ''we give up the lead , they were playing great . they were coming at us with everything . we showed a lot of determination , a lot of perseverance . ''the sharks took a 2 0 lead in the best of seven series , which shifts to san###jose for games sunday and tuesday . san###jose was 17 2 5 at home this season .
when the mets cited a blister and a rising innings count as their reasons for manipulating matt###harvey 's pitching schedule , the hope was that their showpiece pitcher would still be able to start in the showcase###event at their home###stadium . every time harvey has taken the mound for the mets , it has been a special day , but perhaps never more so than on tuesday , when he will be the starting###pitcher for the national###league in the 84th all star game , at citi###field . bruce###bochy , the manager of the national###league team , announced monday that harvey would start in the second all star game hosted by the mets , and the first at citi###field . mets manager terry###collins said harvey was likely to throw two innings , if all goes well . he will face the 13 game winner max###scherzer of the detroit###tigers in a game that will decide home###field###advantage for october 's world###series . the mets chose not to have harvey make his last scheduled###start in pittsburgh in a game that theoretically could affect a pennant###race . but they thought he was ready to throw an inning or two in a game that could help project his rising###star across the baseball world . it 's not an exhibition###game for matt###harvey tomorrow , you can bet on that . collins , a coach on bochy 's staff , said . he 's bound and determined to be the best . that 's all he ever talks about . this is just another step so that he shows everyone that 's going to be here tomorrow and everyone watching on tv that he 's as good as there is . harvey , an all star just 355 days after making his major###league###debut , will become the third mets pitcher to start an all star game , following in the steps of tom###seaver and dwight###gooden , two aces to whom he has been compared . harvey arrives at the all star break with a 7 2 record and a . 35 earned###run###average , with 147 strikeouts in 130 innings . he earned the starting honor over clayton###kershaw of the los###angeles###dodgers , who might have earned the start in another city with his 8 6 record and major###league low . 98 e.r.a .. but bochy said that harvey 's numbers would merit the start in any park in the country . that did not sit well with kershaw . there was no justification required when american###league manager jim###leyland introduced scherzer , his own pitcher with the tigers , and mentioned his 13 1 record and . 19 e.r.a . i do n't think i need to explain anything more than that , leyland said . both managers did their best to appease local###fans . bochy inserted david###wright , the mets' third baseman , into the lineup as the cleanup###hitter , saying that if wright was the captain of the n.l . 's home###run###derby squad on monday###night , then cleanup was the only sensible place for him to hit . leyland has robinson cano , the yankees' second baseman , batting second . but more important , he promised that mariano###rivera , who is retiring after his 19th and last season , would pitch . rivera is on his 13th all star team . the hope , leyland said , was to bring rivera on in a save situation in the ninth###inning . but if that did not materialize , leyland said he would find a spot for rivera . you can rest assured he will be on the mound at some point , and you will see him pitch , leyland said . harvey will become the first pitcher to start in his home###park since roger###clemens started for the n.l . at houston 's minute###maid###park in , a game that ended###badly for clemens and his team , which lost , 9 4 . another pitcher who started in his home###stadium was the boston###red###sox' pedro###martinez , who tossed two perfect innings at fenway###park in , striking out five . harvey , obviously , would prefer that kind of performance . having the opportunity to take the ball is something i 'll###never###forget , and i 'm very thankful for , especially at home , harvey said . it 's my first all star game and being at home , it 's extremely special and i 'm very , very thankful . harvey said he had no more issues with the blister on his right index###finger , which collins said was the worst he had ever seen . he ripped the entire skin back , collins said . i mean , it was torn up . and the next day , you did n't know he even hardly had a blister , because he did exactly what the trainers said to do , how to fix it , how to take care of it . he probably sat there all night taking###care of this thing . and the next day , it looked like it hardly bothered him . some of the other stars said harvey belonged . i ca n't###imagine many pitchers having better stuff than matt###harvey , said joe votto of the cincinnati###reds . st . louis###cardinals catcher yadier###molina compared him to justin###verlander , the tigers' hard throwing right hander . yeah , absolutely verlander agreed . you 're naturally going to draw###comparisons . hard throwing , and he 's having a great year . i have n't seen him pitch in person , so i 'm excited to see him . the mets and baseball are excited for him to be seen , too .
just 18 days after phil###mickelson 's name was engraved on the silver claret###jug at muirfield as the british###open champion , the first tee###shot will be struck at oak hill in rochester for the p.g.a . championship , the season 's final major . the tournament has been called glory 's last shot , and it takes on even greater###importance to tiger###woods and rory###mcilroy , two of the game 's biggest###stars . which one is more desperate to win at oak hill ? woods is no . 1 again and likely to stay that way for the rest of the year . his four pga###tour wins are twice as many as anyone else . he has a comfortable lead in the vardon###trophy standings for the lowest adjusted scoring###average , one of the most reliable measures of who consistently plays the best . but he is on the brink of going five straight###seasons without a victory in a major , the only measure that matters to woods . mcilroy would settle for a trophy of any size . he has gone eight months since he last won a tournament , and his life and game have never been under so much scrutiny . he switched out all his equipment by signing with nike in the off season . he is changing management for the second time in less than two years . that bounce in his step seems to be missing . he looks lost at times . one year ago , not many would have guessed either player would be in this predicament . mcilroy , 24 , won the p.g.a . championship by a record eight shots , his second blowout###victory in a major in two years . he left kiawah###island with the wanamaker trophy and the no . 1 ranking , and he did it wearing a red###shirt on sunday . for the first time , woods had a worthy opponent who was younger . though woods ended another season without a major , there were numerous signs he was on his way back to the top of golf . he had three pga###tour victories . he twice shared the 36 hole lead in majors . he was healthy enough to play a full schedule for the first time in five years . a year later , the landscape for these two stars is far different . i 've won two in the last two years , mcelroy said , referring to his victories in majors . it would be great to continue that trend and win another this year and make it three years in a row . you know he 's got . i 've got two . so i 'd better try and catch up . so i think i need one more than he does . woods , 37 , who for years said a season could not be considered great without a major , keeps trying to explain his 0 for 17 streak in the majors dating to his 14th title , in the 2008 united###states open at torrey###pines . even though i have n't won a major championship in five years , i 've been there in a bunch of them where i 've had chances , he said last month . i just need to keep putting myself there , and eventually , i 'll get some . that 's not entirely accurate , depending on the definition of a serious chance of winning . since returning from the scandal in his personal###life after the 2009 season , woods has not been a factor in the final round of any major . he did not go into sunday at a major closer than four shots off the lead until last month at muirfield . woods was two shots behind , in the next to last group , playing a fast , firm links course that was built for his game . and then he three putted for bogey twice in the opening four holes and never threatened . obviously , tiger has had a very , very good year , said jack###nicklaus , whose 18 majors remain the standard that woods pursues . he 's not finished off a couple majors he 's had an opportunity to be involved in . would be pretty hard###pressed not to make him if not the favorite , one of the favorites going into oak hill . he 'll play oak hill well , and he 'll control his golf###ball well and manage his game well , just as he does every week . will he win more majors ? i think so . when ? i do n't know . more than ever , the majors are up for grabs 18 players have won the last 20 majors , with multiple wins during that span for only mcilroy and mickelson , who produced one of golf 's greatest closing rounds at the british###open . adam scott and justin###rose , longtime###friends born two weeks apart , captured the masters and the united###states open . during an exchange of text###messages after scott won at augusta national , he told rose that this was our time . it mainly referred to how they had paid their dues and were ready to take the next step . it helps that woods has n't won a major in more than five years , and mcilroy is struggling . woods and mcilroy are not the only players desperate to win a major . lee###westwood is coming off another close call in a major , failing to hold a two shot lead at muirfield and feeling helpless when mickelson shot 66 to blow by everybody . luke donald had his closest call yet in a major he played with the winner , rose , at the united###states open . brandt###snedeker is regaining his strong###form from earlier in the year . he joins three americans hunter###mahan , dustin###johnson and matt###kuchar who have won enough big tournaments that a major could be next . mahan might be a sentimental favorite at oak hill . he will be playing for the first time since leaving the canadian open with a two shot lead going into the weekend so he could be with his wife for the birth of their first child , a daughter they named zoe . most peculiar about this season is that 11 players from the top 20 in the world have yet to win a tournament this year . that includes recent major winners like bubba###watson , webb###simpson , charl###schwartzel and keegan###bradley . most prominent on that list is mcilroy . mcilroy has reason to find hope when he looks back to where he was at this time a year ago . he had gone five months without a win , which included a stretch of missed cuts that had critics questioning everything from his game to his romance with the tennis star caroline###wozniacki . mcilroy had a 67 68 weekend at firestone to tie for fifth , gleaning just enough confidence to win by eight shots in the p.g.a . championship . i was sitting up here this time last year probably not feeling as if my game was in great shape , and i 'm sitting up here this year a lot more positive , mcilroy said from the bridgestone###invitational . so that 's a great sign . if something similar could happen like it did last year get a good finish here or get into contention that would set me up for the last major of the season , and going on from there , set me up for the great end of the year .
philadelphia quarterback nick###foles threw seven touchdown passes sunday against oakland and appears to be the new eagles starting###quarterback . that will give michael###vick another eight games to get healthy and prepare for next season , wherever he signs as a free###agent . ( attention , minnesota shoppers . ) lesean###mccoy will be able to run against green###bay , as will the packers rookie eddie###lacy against the eagles . but when philadelphia 's defensive###players look into the packers' backfield and see seneca###wallace filling in for the injured aaron###rodgers , they will not exactly be quaking in their turf shoes . but the packers' offense might . it 's convenient that jacksonville desperately needs a franchise quarterback and that at least two of them will apparently be available at the top of the 2014 n.f.l . draft . right now , however , the jaguars have bigger problems . whom does their obviously not the answer quarterback blaine###gabbert throw to besides cecil shorts , who caught seven passes against the 49 ers in week 8 but has been nursing a sore groin for weeks ? the answer is no one . carolina 's defense has given up . 1 rushing###yards###per###game , and the team has won four consecutive###games by double###digits , scoring 30 points or more in each of them . impressive , but those four opponents have a combined###record of . san###francisco is coming off a bye###week if you count the jaguars game , it 's two bye weeks and is beginning to get the gang back together . defensive###end aldon###smith , the rookie defensive###lineman tank carradine , wide###receiver mario###manningham and cornerback eric wright might all suit up . that depth spells trouble for the panthers . detroit comes out of its bye###week with a head of steam . lions quarterback matthew###stafford makes up for his active###imagination in terms of what constitutes an open receiver with a huge arm and the unwavering support of his teammates . he also has wide###receiver calvin###johnson , who has even greater###powers than the transformer leader he has become . judging from the way chicago barely squeaked by the aaron###rodgers less packers on monday , look for megatron to save the day for detroit . these teams dropped games they should have won in week . but cincinnati has had a string of injuries to players on defense , including the dominant defensive###tackle geno atkins . he was lost for the season with a torn knee###ligament , which might just be the blow that topples the bengals' season . baltimore , which has a winning###record at home , certainly hopes so . seattle should be excused from playing the rest of its regular###season###games . with another heart stopping win , overcoming a 24 7 third quarter###deficit against tampa###bay , the seahawks have proved that they do n't panic . atlanta , led by matt###ryan , who has been throwing interceptions at an alarming###rate ( he has , only four fewer than he had all last season , has apparently decided that sleepwalking through the season is acceptable as long as the players look busy . but they are not even succeeding at that . when st . louis wide###receiver tavon###austin was drafted , he was full of the confidence possessed only by rookies and the seahawks' secondary . with only two touchdowns in his first eight games , austin changed his tune , saying that the n.f.l . was a little harder than i thought at first . to which every current and former n.f.l . player replied , you think ? break up the giants . with a two game winning###streak , they are still alive , for lack of a better term , in the n.f.c . east , a division led , for lack of a better term , by dallas at . that 's right the giants are in last place , only two and a half games out of first .
berlin german leaders , heeding economists' warnings that the younger###generation may become disillusioned with the european project , are counting on a series of bilateral agreements to help curb stubbornly high youth unemployment in the european###union . wolfgang###sch###uble , the german finance minister , and v tor gaspar , his counterpart in portugal , announced a plan on wednesday to use the german state development###bank to help set up a financial###institution to assist portuguese under age 25 in getting jobs or job###training . this week , ursula###von###der###leyen , the german labor minister , signed an agreement with her spanish counterpart , f tima b ez garc a , that foresees bringing thousands of young spaniards to germany for apprenticeships . at the same time , germany will seek to help spain build a dual track vocational system in which young people earn qualifications through a combination of work and study . the initiatives are part of a multipronged effort by berlin to quickly get more young people into the work force , a move that experts say is crucial if a unified europe is to survive into the next generation . what is decisive is that we must be faster and more definitive in fighting youth unemployment , mr . sch uble said . more than . 6 million people under 25 are without work across the union , according to figures released by eurostat , the statistical###office of the european###union . among the countries with the largest###number of young people out of work are the weaker members of the euro###zone that are undergoing deep###cuts to social###services and other structural changes , part of efforts to recover from the debt crisis . germany grappled with its own youth unemployment problem early last decade . while its numbers then were nowhere near the 60 percent of young people now out of work in greece , or the nearly 56 percent in spain , german leaders said their experience could be of value to their european partners . next week , german and french officials plan to draw up a bilateral###agreement on employment when they meet alongside european business###leaders at a conference in paris . on july , chancellor angela###merkel of germany will gather labor ministers and the heads of 27 european###union labor agencies in berlin for a meeting to further discuss the problem . details of the german french proposal remain vague , but mr . sch uble insisted that financing would not be an issue . he cited the 6 billion###euros , or . 8 billion , that the european###union has earmarked in its new budget for addressing the problem , as well as additional###money that was given to the european###investment###bank in luxembourg intended for loans to small and midsize businesses , which would help create more jobs . we are working to use the existing funds more efficiently , mr . sch uble said in berlin . unemployment in the early###stages of a person 's career damages the ability to integrate into society , or , in the case of the union , to later support the idea of more integration on the continent , said joachim m ller , director of the institute for employment research in nuremberg . the long###term effects reach far beyond the working world , he added . it could be catastrophic for their idea of europe .
airline passengers should be allowed to use their personal electronic###devices to read , play games or enjoy movies and music , even when planes are on the ground or flying below , 000 feet , according to recommendations an advisory###panel sent to the federal###aviation###administration on monday . but the panel said that restrictions should remain on sending text###messages , browsing the web or checking e mail after the plane 's doors have been closed . passengers can do that only when the aircraft 's wi###fi network is turned on , typically above , 000 feet . the use of cellphones to make voice calls , which was not part of the review , will still be prohibited throughout the flight . the review was the work of a 28 member panel set up last year to revise current###policies . it provides a road###map to changing the policy , but it is now up to the f.a.a . 's administrator , michael p . huerta , to decide whether and when to do so . the f.a.a . received the report and recommendations today on the expanded use of personal electronic###devices , said les dorr , a spokesman for the agency . the administrator will review the report and determine next steps . the panel would maintain restrictions on devices like smartphones and tablets with data communication features that could potentially disrupt some airplane systems . for that reason , those devices should be used only on airplane mode , which disables their transmission capability . this would leave passengers , broadly , with tablets , e readers and smartphones to use any material books , music , or movies that has been downloaded before the flight . the f.a.a . started its review of current###policies more than a year ago and appointed the panel to look at the technical###aspects of the ban and outline steps to ease restrictions . policy changes have been long expected by passengers , increasingly###frustrated by rules seen as outdated in a tech driven world . the f.a.a . recognized the need for change , given the proliferation of electronic###devices in recent###years , particularly smartphones and tablets . the policy is increasingly###difficult to enforce . one study###suggested that about a third of all passengers did not turn off their devices once on a plane . senator claire###mccaskill , democrat of missouri , who has pressed the f.a.a . to relax the ban , said she was pleased with the panel 's recommendations and hoped that the f.a.a . would adopt them quickly . anytime you have a rule that appears to be about safety but it is widely ignored , it undermines the importance of other rules about safety , she said . if people are being told to do things because it keeps the public safe , there needs to be solid scientific###data that supports that , and clearly that was not the case with this prohibition . airlines , too , have been eager to relax the rules , which are seen often as a distraction for flight###attendants forced to police the cabin . they are also expanding the use of wireless systems on board , offering live###television and considering streaming movies to passengers' own devices . but given the persistent uncertainty , as well as the potential risk , the f.a.a . has taken a cautious approach . in recent###years , pilots have reported hundreds of episodes in which they suspected that electronic###devices might have interfered with instruments on the flight###deck . but the evidence has been largely anecdotal , and neither regulators nor airlines have been able to formally substantiate them . the effort to regulate electronics on planes began in the late 1950s , when studies found that passengers carrying portable fm radios interfered with radar navigation systems used at the time . the panel recommended that the f.a.a . require airlines to demonstrate that their planes were immune to electromagnetic###interference . many have done so already when installing wi###fi . once that is done the agency can allow the airlines to lift the restrictions . that could happen next year . consumer###electronics makers have long called for the relaxed rules . amazon , which makes the kindle electronic reader , once loaded a plane with kindles to see whether it would have an impact on flight###instruments . we 've been fighting for our customers on this issue for years testing an airplane packed full of kindles , working with the f.a.a. , and serving as the device manufacturer on this committee , drew herdener , a spokesman for amazon , which makes the kindle . this is a big###win for customers and , frankly , it 's about time . the current###policy is that all electronic###devices must be turned off once the main cabin###doors are closed and until the aircraft reaches , 000 feet , or descends below that level for landing . flight###attendants' efforts to enforce the rule can cause tensions with passengers . above , 000 feet , where possible interference is deemed to be less critical and pilots have more time to respond to a problem , passengers are allowed to use laptops , smartphones and tablets , provided that their transmission functions remain turned off . the use of cellphones is not banned by the f.a.a . but by telecommunication regulators because their use in flight could interfere with transmissions between cell towers on the ground .
it has become a familiar question backstage at festivals , concert###halls or anywhere else that musicians gather on the road have you heard that amazing cuban percussionist in new york###city ? pedrito mart###nez may not yet be known to the public , but among his peers , he is firmly###established as a source of rhythmic delight and inspiration . fifteen years after arriving from havana , mr . mart###nez , 40 , is a first call player for recording###sessions of all types , and his three nights a week residency at guantanamera in manhattan has made that small restaurant club a favorite hangout for visiting pop , rock and jazz stars . on tuesday , he takes another step forward , with the release of his first cd as a bandleader , accompanied by a celebratory show at city winery . pedrito 's got a unique###combination of forces coming together in him , said the musician and writer ned###sublette , author of cuba and its music . he 's a percussionist with deep drum knowledge , and also a singer and bandleader , but he 's also something over and above that the flowering of a new creative###spirit of rumba , breaking out of the traditional context and taking it to a larger audience . mr . mart###nez was born and raised in a havana neighborhood called cayo hueso , a traditional center of the family of african derived rhythms known as rumba . not only did he have uncles who played the music , but he also grew up just a block away from the palacio de la rumba and sneaked into that theater to watch top orchestras rehearse when he was a child . initially , though , because mr . mart###nez could not qualify for government programs to train musicians , which are limited in number , he thought about becoming an athlete . he boxed for a while , but focused on judo , which gave him stamina and made him limber , two qualities that have served him well in coping with the physical###demands of playing the congas and the two headed bat drum , his main###instruments . i never went to music school , because in cuba , at that time , to get in , you needed a connection , some clout , and i never had that kind of connection , he said in a recent interview . but at the same time , i 'm happy with the way i learned things on the street , because they teach you things you ca n't learn in school . as a teenager , mr . mart###nez began###working as a musician and performed with top ensembles , like those of tata g ines and los mu equitos de matanzas . but he found the routine , playing in hotels for a dollar a month , he said , enervating and demeaning . if you wanted a ham sandwich , you had to eat it on the sly , in the kitchen , because if the manager of the hotel saw you eating in front of the foreigners , you 'd get fired , he recalled . and then , at 2 in the morning , i 'd have to walk home carrying my congas or my bat , because there was no bus . when i got home , there was no light , water or gas , so i 'd eat some cold###food , amid a terrible heat . it was the worst time of my life . in , the canadian jazz saxophonist jane###bunnett , a frequent###visitor to havana , invited mr . mart###nez to join her touring###band , which allowed him to leave cuba . when the group got to new york , and his contract ended , he decided to stay on , because of all the musical opportunities here , and played with local###bands . breezy , outgoing and relentlessly optimistic , mr . mart###nez said he thought making his mark would be easy . but he went to a jazz show and had an unpleasant revelation after he was invited to jam onstage , the band , led by the trumpeter brian###lynch , promptly launched into a tune that began in a 5 4 time signature and then shifted to , and he was lost . you hardly ever see that kind of irregular time in cuban###music , so i had no idea what to do , he recalled . it was the biggest embarrassment i 've been through as a musician , but it 's what made me say to myself , 'this city is a place that can teach you a lot of things , and i 'm going to learn how to play this . ' so mr . mart###nez embarked on an intense program of instruction , learning to read music and studying###composition . he also took private###lessons with a fellow cuban , rom n d az , a master percussionist and santer a priest whom he describes as a mentor . a strong religious element pervades mr . mart###nez 's own music . at his home in union###city , n.j. , where he lives with his wife , daughter and parents , a room is set aside as a shrine to santer a deities , and he said it is there , practicing on the bat , often used in santer a ceremonies , that he perfects many of the innovative rhythms he plays onstage . mr . martinez said one big challenge he faced in making the new cd , called###simply the pedrito mart###nez group ( mot ma music , was translating the dynamism of the band 's live performances . the record includes several songs the group regularly###plays live , both originals and cuban standards , as well as afro cubanized versions of robert###johnson 's travelling riverside blues and the jackson 5 favorite i 'll be there . all four members of the group sing , with mr . mart###nez doing lead###vocals on most tracks . the record also features###guest###appearances###by wynton###marsalis , john###scofield and steve###gadd , the ace american drummer who also produced the record with mr . mart###nez . it 's pretty extraordinary what they do , mr . gadd said . the rhythms that pedrito is singing are complicated themselves , and then to be able to play other complicated rhythms around that , it 's special . this is a real band , singing and playing rhythmically advanced music of the highest###order . when mr . gadd stops by guantanamera , he occasionally joins the group onstage , but most visiting musical luminaries , perhaps as intimidated as mr . mart###nez was when he first encountered jazz , are content to remain in their seats . on successive###nights last month , members of earth , wind fire and a spanish flamenco troupe showed up , and mr . mart###nez 's manager , paul siegel , also remembers visits by eric###clapton , steve###winwood , paul###simon , roger###waters , billy###cobham and stanley###clarke . over the last six to eight years , i 've taken every band i 've been with to see him , because his musicality is just staggering , said the guitarist derek###trucks , who has played with the allman###brothers and eric###clapton bands . after allmans' rehearsals , three or four of us will head there , and it 's funny how many other musicians you 'll see . you know that everybody is going to go through new york , so you say 'you 've got to see this guy , you 've got to go to guantanamera and see pedrito whipping it .

detroit chrysler , the smallest of the american###automakers , on wednesday reported a big increase in 2012 earnings that helped its italian parent###company , fiat , become profitable for the year as well . chrysler said that its net###income soared to . 67 billion last year about nine times as much as the 183 million it earned in . the exponential increase underscored the company 's comeback from its government bailout and bankruptcy in , when it was taken over by fiat . in the fourth###quarter alone , chrysler said it earned 378 million , a 68 percent increase from 225 million in the same period in . revenue in the quarter was . 2 billion , a 13 percent gain from . 1 billion a year earlier . chrysler concluded a very successful 2012 with a robust fourth###quarter performance , said jesse toprak , an analyst with the auto research site truecar . com . the company was the only domestic automaker to gain market###share last year . chrysler also benefited from having little exposure to the deepening economic###crisis in europe , where vehicle###sales have fallen to the lowest###levels in nearly 20 years . the european problems , however , took a heavy toll on results at fiat , which also reported earnings on wednesday . without chrysler , fiat said it would have lost . 04 billion###euros . 4 billion ) in . but instead , chrysler 's results helped fiat earn a profit of . 41 billion###euros for the year , about a 15 percent###decrease from the . 65 billion###euros the italian###automaker earned in , which included chrysler after the middle of the year . in the fourth###quarter , fiat reported a profit of 388 million###euros . without chrysler 's contributions , it would have lost 241 million###euros . analysts said chrysler 's strong###performance in the surging united###states market should compensate for fiat 's troubles for some time to come . with europe in the mess it is in , it 's going to be a tough slog for fiat , said mike wall , an analyst with the market###research firm ihs automotive . they need all the help chrysler can give them . fiat currently owns a.5 percent###stake in chrysler , and has been consolidating the american company 's performance into its own results since june . chrysler has been growing###steadily as it introduced new vehicles and revamped older###models . its revenue for 2012 was . 8 billion , a.6 percent improvement from 55 billion the previous year . for the year , its global vehicle###sales increased to . 2 million , an 18 percent increase from . 9 million the previous year , and its market###share in the united###states improved to . 2 percent , up from . 5 percent a year earlier . sergio###marchionne , who serves as chief###executive of both chrysler and fiat , said the turnaround at chrysler was gaining###momentum thanks to solid sales of core products like the ram pickup and the jeep###grand###cherokee s.u.v . we pause for a moment to enjoy our accomplishments , mr . marchionne said , but we will not stop . mr . marchionne forecast continued###improvement for chrysler this year . he said the company expected to earn net###income of . 2 billion in , on revenue of 72 billion or higher . he also outlined###plans on wednesday to bring more fiat and alfa###romeo models to the united###states , even as chrysler delays the introduction of some of its own new products . the alfa###romeo brand , which left the american market almost 20 years###ago , will return with a sports###car later this year . it is the first of several new alfas destined for the united###states over the next three years . fiat will also add several new products for the american market , building on its first offering , the tiny fiat 500 microcar . mr . marchionne said that a few chrysler car models , mostly derived from fiat platforms , would be delayed as a result . the product plan is a living document , he said , referring to changes in chrysler 's vehicle timetable . and we continue to rework that document . mr . marchionne also said plans were fluid regarding an initial###public###offering of chrysler stock . a health###care trust for retired members of the united###automobile###workers union is seeking an i.p.o . to cash out its . 5 percent ownership###stake in chrysler . chrysler 's large###profits in 2012 will directly###benefit its current hourly work force . about , 000 union members will receive average profit###sharing checks of , 250 , the company said .

new york american twins bob and mike###bryan had their calendar year grand###slam hopes dashed at the u.s . open on thursday and then said no duo will likely ever accomplish the feat again . the top seeded brothers , who won this year 's australian###open , french###open and wimbledon men 's doubles titles , fell 3 6 6 3 6 4 to czech radek stepanek and india 's leander###paes in the semi###finals of the men 's doubles at flushing###meadows . the hype surrounding the brothers' attempt to secure the first doubles calendar slam since australia 's ken###mcgregor and frank###sedgman in 1951 came to a halt after one hour and 51 minutes on arthur###ashe###stadium . realistically it will probably never happen again , mike said . the margins are just so fine in doubles . there are just too many great teams out there and too much can go wrong . a lot has to go right to be in that position . the brothers , who became the most successful men 's pair in grand###slam history in january when they won their 13th doubles title together at the australian###open , said they were anxious in the lead up to the year 's final grand###slam . i do n't know about mike , but i have had a tough time sleeping in the last couple of weeks , bob said . his brother added it 's been in the back of your mind the whole way . once you get out there , you try to put it aside . you win a set and then you 're seeing that , okay , you 're three sets away from a grand###slam . every point just becomes a little bit bigger , every moment . it makes it a little tougher . bob denied the pressure got to them . after cruising through the first set , they fell behind 1 5 in the third set before a comeback started too late . once you get on the court you 're just boom , game plan , focus . it definitely did n't get to us , said bob . it was just that they hit some great shots . in one sense we 're disappointed . in another sense , we 're relieved and we can start the next chapter . we 're competitors and we hate to lose , and we knew what was riding on this match . but it 's a little bit of a relief when you get to exhale for the first time in a few months .
there are only about , 000 black rhinoceroses left in the world at least until next year , when a high bidder gets a chance to shoot one . this week brought news of a controversial auction , plus an account of what the food###and###drug###administration found in imported spices . british archaeologists working on a construction site in london were thrilled to find a roman###era sculpture of an eagle , nearly , 000 years old , carved from cotswold limestone . the 26 inch###tall sculpture was exquisitely preserved and will be displayed in the museum of london for six months before researchers take it back . the artifact , which once adorned an aristocratic tomb , is among the very best statues surviving from roman###britain , martin henig , an oxford archaeologist who specializes in roman###art , told the guardian . people are less likely to lie and cheat in the morning , according to a modest study published in the journal psychological science . in four experiments , participants were given small financial###incentives to lie . in one , 62 undergraduates those perpetual guinea###pigs were flashed an image of a square that held 20 dots , spread unevenly , and asked if the left or right side held more . the students earned 5 cents for each right side answer and . 5 cents for each left side answer , whether right or wrong . people who took this and other tests in the afternoon were more likely to tilt their answers toward the lucrative ones , the researchers found . we propose that the normal , unremarkable experiences associated with everyday living can deplete one 's capacity to resist moral temptations , they concluded . the food###and###drug###administration calls it a systemic challenge . you and i might find more colorful words 12 percent of spices imported to the united###states are contaminated with insect parts , whole insects , rodent hairs and other things , like salmonella , according to the new york times . spices from mexico and india had the highest###rates of contamination . while india is urging spice farmers to improve practices , the american spice trade###association says spices sold in the united###states are treated for contamination . consumers can have confidence that the spices they purchase at their grocery###store from reputable companies are clean and safe to eat , the group said in response to the f.d.a . report . the dallas safari club , a group of big###game###hunting enthusiasts , will auction off a rare permit to shoot an endangered black###rhinoceros in namibia and bring the head back as a trophy . the permit , one of five granted each year by the namibian government , will be the first sold in the united###states it is expected to fetch upward of 1 million at the auction in january . critics have piled on , but the club says there are valid reasons to cull older , male rhinos , which often kill other rhinos . the animals being targeted are troublemakers that are too old to breed , the club said , and the money will go to wildlife###conservation . though it may seem counterintuitive to critics , the hunt is being sanctioned by scientists around the world as helpful to the future of a rare###species , it said in a slightly defensive sounding fact###sheet . the greenland###ice###sheet was first crossed in 1888 in a perilous foot journey led by the norwegian explorer fridtjof###nansen . today it is scary for different reasons its rapid melting is a symbol of global###warming . on wednesday , nasa will start flying a c 130 research aircraft across the sheet , to measure changes in the height of the greenland###ice###sheet and surrounding arctic sea###ice produced by a single season of summer melt . studies in recent###years have found worrisome melt levels .
sydney###australia has a few help wanted ads it would like you to take a look at . there is this opening in the australian state of new south###wales chief funster . responsibilities ? review festivals and events , tweet about them and be a sydney vip . meanwhile , western###australia is hunting for a taste master , whose duties###include eating the state 's tastiest food , seeking out its finest produce and uncovering the best bars and restaurants . but behind the jobs' impressively lighthearted descriptions lies a serious goal resuscitating the country 's tourism###industry , which experts say has about , 000 unfilled positions and has been hit###hard by a strong australian###dollar . the segment represents about . 5 percent of the country 's gross###domestic###product . the novelty listings are part of a viral###marketing campaign called best jobs in the world by tourism###australia , the government body tasked with attracting###visitors in an increasingly###competitive global tourism market to visit one of the world 's most expensive and remote destinations . the campaign aims to promote australia 's working###holiday maker program , in which 18 to 30 year olds from nearly 30 countries can spend a year living and working down under . the promotion expands on a 2009 effort by tourism queensland in which applicants vied for a six month gig as caretaker of a tropical island paradise , which attracted , 000 applicants . tourism###australia , which started the current campaign march , says it has received , 000 applications in the first week , this time around . but while the campaign highlights the holiday aspect of the program , it is the working part that is of the most concern to australia 's tourism and hospitality###sector . the country is in the midst of a mining###boom that has lured thousands of young###workers into resource related###fields , leaving tourism , manufacturing and many other sectors of the australian economy short of skilled###labor . and the australian###dollar , which has soared in recent###years because of the mining###boom , has driven up costs , discouraging young tourists at precisely the time when they are most needed to offset those labor###shortages , said trent zimmerman , acting###chief###executive of the tourism transport forum , a lobbying group . the advantage of working###holiday makers of course is that they 're people traveling here for a set period of time , so they allow us to meet the short###term needs of the employment market , which are being affected by things like the staggering , vacuuming power that the mining###industry has in terms of employees , he said in an interview . so it helps alleviate the short###term ups and down in the labor market . the tyranny of distance sydney is about , 000 kilometers , or , 000 miles , from both new york and london has traditionally been the main barrier to tourism in australia , despite its array of world###class beaches and sites like the sydney###opera###house and uluru , formerly known as ayers###rock . technological and commercial innovations have driven airfares down in recent###decades , leaving the inflationary pressures of the mining###boom the biggest remaining obstacle , said felicia mariani , managing###director of the australian tourism export council . probably what has been a challenge over the last couple of years in particular is the increasing cost of visiting australia , she said . so while the cost of getting here is not so much the issue , it is the cost once you 're here . australia was the 42nd most visited country in the world in , with . 9 million , or . 6 percent , of global arrivals . at the same time , however , it was ranked###eighth in terms of global tourism receipts , taking in . 4 billion , or 3 percent , of the money spent on tourism globally , according to the united###nations world###tourism###organization . thanks to the strength of the dollar , even though its share of arrivals fell . 2 percent compared with the previous year , its share of receipts rose . 4 percent . the youth market people 15 to 30 years old represents 26 percent , or about . 6 million , of international###visitors to australia . in addition to providing labor , particularly in rural###areas where the draw from high mining wages is particularly enticing for locals , they stay###longer than other tourists and spend more money . working vacationers spend , 000 australian dollars , or about , 300 , on average during their yearlong stays , according to tourism###australia .
los###angeles for much of the last decade , metro###goldwyn###mayer has been troubled by financial###turmoil and infuriating production stops and starts , including a debacle in which tom###cruise helped###run its united###artists label . is it possible , just maybe , that the studio finally has its act together ? it certainly appears that way , even as some questions remain . shares of mgm holdings' thinly traded over the counter stock have risen 50 percent since april , to about . 50 . revenue almost tripled in the last quarter , to 339 million , according to the company . helped by repeated standard###poor 's upgrades over the last three years , mgm now has access to revolving###lines of credit totaling 750 million . the company was on death 's doorstep and now has effectively no debt and is generating a ton of cash , said kevin ulrich , co founder of anchorage capital group , a new york investment firm that is mgm 's largest###single owner , with a 30 percent###stake . that 's an outstanding turnaround . most important , new movies are flowing from the studio . a remake of carrie arrives on oct . 18 , while the blockbuster hobbit series returns in december . robocop , 22 jump street and hercules come next year . mgm 's james###bond franchise returns in 2015 and remakes of ben###hur and poltergeist are in the works . mgm 's television business a vital part of its growth###strategy is also showing momentum . vikings had its debut on the history###channel and was an instant###hit . teen###wolf continues on mtv , while paternity court arrives in syndication on sept . 23 and a series adapted from fargo chugs toward fx . the mgm name had become pretty toxic , both in the financial community and the creative one , and that 's certainly not the case anymore , gary###barber , mgm 's chief###executive , said last week in a wide ranging interview . he added , i feel that mgm is fully###rehabilitated . hollywood is not entirely convinced . some movie executives dismiss the studio as little more than a , 000 movie library that has already been aggressively exploited on dvd and in cable reruns . the studio 's library generated about 558 million in revenue in , when the dvd market was strong . the total had plunged to 228 million by . mgm has in recent###years declined to disclose how much revenue its stockpile of old films generates , leading to suspicion that sales are weak . all mr . barber will say is that library revenue is substantial . mgm has blown the comeback trumpets before only to have its owners cash out and leave the studio reeling anew . the billionaire investor kirk###kerkorian , for instance , bought and sold the studio three times between 1969 and . by that measure , the studio 's long###term future is far from clear . in addition to anchorage , shareholders include hedge###funds like highland capital management and davidson kempner . many initially bought mgm debt , which was converted to equity in 2010 as part of a prepackaged bankruptcy . hedge###funds are not known as patient caretakers . it 's one thing to say the company is doing great , but it 's another thing to successfully sell out a position , said steven azarbad , co founder of maglan capital , a small hedge###fund that owns about 1 percent of mgm . this thing should either be sold or i.p.o . 'd . i 'd like to see that happen by the end of the year . selling is a potential option . ( lions###gate###entertainment is seen as the likeliest bidder . ) mgm could also potentially expand through an acquisition of its own . as for an initial###public###offering , the studio last year filed a registration###statement for one , but never moved###forward with it . because the studio has since grown , that filing is void . an i.p.o . will continue to be an opportunity , mr . barber said . we 're carefully evaluating all of our options . quite frankly , we do n't need that capital right now . are his hedge###fund shareholders restless ? no , no , no , mr . barber said . the board of directors is strongly###supportive of the business###strategy we have developed and that 's not for tomorrow but for long###term value growth . that 's a critical###difference from the past . mr . ulrich , of anchorage , said , as long as the return profile remains very strong we will remain a key shareholder . using standard financial comparisons , anchorage and others believe that mgm is sharply undervalued compared to other independent studios like dreamworks###animation and lions###gate .

jersey###city patrick###reed hit balls on the driving###range while listening to the indie rock###band imagine###dragons on his mp3 player , which was in the left front pocket of his golf pants . upon completing his warm up , he pulled his ear buds out . for the rest of an abbreviated workday friday at liberty national###golf###club , reed 's wife , justine , was in his ear . reed , 23 , in his first full season on the pga###tour , employs his wife as his caddie , an arrangement seldom seen on tour for reasons that seem self evident to other married###couples . i would think it could get kind of complicated , said hunter###mahan , who played in the group with reed and jim###furyk for the first two rounds of the barclays , the opening tournament of the monthlong fedex###cup###playoffs . the reeds make it look simple like fun , even . their professional collaboration started last year , when they were engaged . justine karain , who was a competitive###swimmer and soccer###player , wore patrick down with her entreaties to carry his bag . he gave her a tryout on a sweltering houston day and packed extra rain gear , water and anything else he might need . that day , i struggled to get through the last two holes , he said , but she was fine . reed added she just has a knack for reading greens extremely well , and she knows how far i hit every club . she 's always at lessons with me and always around me when i 'm practicing , so it 's basically like my coach being out there with me . justine reed calls to mind the actress kristin###chenoweth , which perhaps explains why more men in the crowd friday aimed their cameras at her than at furyk , the 2010 fedex###cup champion . people laugh at the sight of her lugging a 45 pound bag that appears to weigh half as much as she does , but there is no making fun of the results . at the wyndham###championship in north###carolina last sunday , the reeds became the first husband###wife team to win on the tour since steve###stricker triumphed at the kemper and western opens in 1996 with nicki stricker as his caddie . it was the reeds' third top 10 finish in three starts . after that rush of success came the inevitable crash . we 're still excited about the win last weekend , reed said friday , but we 're also exhausted . with their tee time friday moved to past 4 in the afternoon , the couple planned to sleep in until 30 , a time they would usually consider borderline slothful . they were awakened at 30 by the hotel maid when she let herself in to clean the room . as night fell on their second round friday , the reeds were on the sixth tee , five strokes above the projected cut with four holes to play . maybe we can do the ultimate and shoot five under the last four holes , he said . if not , we 'll just rest this weekend . the reeds will get the rest they need . they came out saturday###morning and finished birdie bogey bogey par for a six over , which was 17 strokes behind the leader , matt###kuchar . after the third round , kuchar is tied for the lead with gary###woodland at 12 under . a caddie never rests during a round , with clubs to count , pull , clean and retrieve , yardage to walk off , putts to read , sand to rake , balls to mop and divots to replace . on the par 4 15th hole on friday , reed 's approach found a greenside trap . after he hit out , she handed him his putter , picked up the rake and smoothed the sand as three men holding cups of beer stood within earshot critiquing the technique of the girl caddie , as they described her . their conversation was momentarily drowned out by a woman , accompanied by her husband , who shouted , power to the woman ! justine reed smiled and kept raking . usually , i 'll hear quite a few women in the crowd who will cheer me on , she said . it 's definitely a little bit empowering . as she was walking off the second tee , a man shouted , happy wife , happy life ! she said , i thought that was pretty###funny .
phoenix immigration agents arrested the mother and brother of a prominent###activist during a raid at her home here late thursday , unleashing a vigorous response on social###media and focusing new attention on one of the most controversial aspects of the obama administration 's policies on deportation . the agents knocked on erika andiola 's door shortly after 9 p.m. , asking for her mother , maria arreola . ms . arreola had been stopped by the police in nearby mesa last year and detained for driving without a license . her fingerprints were sent to federal immigration officials as part of a controversial program called secure communities , which the obama administration has been trying to expand nationwide . that routine###check revealed that ms . arreola had been returned to mexico in 1998 after she was caught trying to illegally cross the border into arizona with erika and two of her siblings in tow . as a result , she was placed on a priority list for deportation . after being seized on thursday , she could have been sent back to mexico in a matter of hours , but obama administration officials moved###quickly to undo the arrests . officials had been pressured by the robust response from advocates through phone calls , e mails and online petitions , but primarily on twitter , where they mobilized support for ms . andiola , a well known advocate for young illegal###immigrants , under the hashtag weareandiola . the reaction offered the obama administration a taste of what it might expect when it gets into the thick of the debate over an immigration overhaul , which congress is expected to tackle this year . president###obama has already been under harsh###criticism for the number of foreigners deported since he took office roughly , 000 each year , a record unmatched since the 1950s . ms . andiola , 25 , posted a tearful video on youtube shortly after her mother and brother were handcuffed and driven away . i need everybody to stop pretending that nothing is wrong , she said in the video , stop pretending that we 're all just living normal###lives , because we 're not . this could happen to any of us anytime . she is the co founder of the arizona dream###act coalition , one of the groups pushing for a reprieve for immigrants brought illegally to the united###states as children , as she was . she has been arrested while camped in front of senator john###mccain 's office here , protested outside the united###states###capitol , and appeared on the cover of time magazine in june under the headline , we are americans just not legally . in november , ms . andiola got a work permit under a program begun by the obama administration last year that gives certain young illegal###immigrants temporary reprieve from deportation . she graduated from arizona###state###university in . on friday###afternoon , her mother returned###home from a detention###center in florence , 70 miles southeast of phoenix and usually the last stop for certain illegal###immigrants before they are deported . her brother , heriberto andiola arreola , 36 , who had been kept in phoenix , was let go earlier , at 6 a.m . their swift releases underline the power of the youth immigrant movement and their social###media activism , which was critical in spreading ms . andiola 's story overnight . in a statement , barbara gonzalez , a spokeswoman for immigration and customs enforcement , said a preliminary review of the case revealed that it contains some of the elements outlined in the agency 's prosecutorial discretion policy and would merit an exercise of discretion . advocates have long argued that the policy has done little to keep families from being broken apart by deportations . ms . andiola said in an interview that she told her mother to go to her room before opening the door thursday###night she suspected the men standing outside worked for immigration . by the time the men came in , her brother , who was outside talking to a neighbor , was already in handcuffs , she said . where 's maria ? the men asked her , she recalled . ms . arreola walked out of the room and , in spanish , the men asked her to accompany them outside , where they placed her under arrest . though she and her son are free , their future is uncertain , as they could be arrested again while their cases are under review or deported should the eventual ruling go against them , said marielena hincapi , executive###director of the national immigration###law center , one of the groups helping the family . stories like this , ms . hincapi went on , happen every day , in every state , outside of the media###spotlight . what made it different this time is that ms . andiola had connections and wasted no time mobilizing them . there are others , she said , whom you never hear about .
even before the record business imploded , musicians regularly brainstormed about ways to get their work to potential listeners . but carla###kihlstedt and matthias bossi were feeling more than the usual###sense of urgency when they came up with a novel plan , a subscription web###site , rabbit rabbit radio , to distribute new music by their latest band , rabbit rabbit . every other conversation you had with a musician , the gist of it was 'the business is falling apart . what are we going to do ? ' ms . kihlstedt said by phone . i ca n't tell you how many times i 've###worked really hard on a cd , for however many months or years , and then you hope the label does its job and gets it out , and that the stars align . but at a certain point , we got tired of complaining and began saying , 'o . k. , what are we going to do ? ' with some help from george hurd , a composer and music administrator , they produced a blueprint for rabbit rabbit radio and started the web###page in february . the plan was to release a new song for subscribers on the first of every month . along with the song , ms . kihlstedt and mr . bossi , who are married to each other , began###posting video###clips , slide shows and photo###albums information about the making of the track essays on various subjects and lists that might include links to clips by other musicians whose work they admire or notes about restaurants they have discovered on tour . past###releases can be explored in their online archives . subscribers pay 2 to 5 a month . ( there is no difference in access it 's a matter of paying what you can . ) in order to work , mr . bossi said , we get so involved in preparing the material surrounding the song that it feels like we 're putting together a magazine issue every month . so far , 18 months into the project , rabbit rabbit radio has nearly 900 subscribers . ms . kihlstedt , 41 , and mr . bossi , 34 , who live in dennis , mass . , said they would be happy if their subscription list grew by 500 listeners a year . our goal is to be able to count on rabbit rabbit radio as part of our monthly income , she said , noting that if you factor in web###hosting fees , site management costs and other incidentals to say nothing of the time they put into recording the music and preparing other materials they are barely making a profit . but we 're taking the long view and giving it three years . the first subscribers were drawn from followers of mr . bossi and ms . kihlstedt 's other bands the art###rock group sleepytime###gorilla###museum and causing a tiger , an improvisatory ensemble as well as fans of ms . kihlstedt 's various ensembles , which include tin hat and 2 foot yard . ( ms . kihlstedt also has a career as a classical composer she performed her recent song###cycle , at night we walk in circles and are consumed by fire , with the international###contemporary###ensemble at mostly mozart on saturday###evening . ) we spread the initial word about the site in a very grass###roots kind of way , said mr . hurd , who manages the site . we reached out to carla and matthias 's fan###base that they 'd been amassing over the past couple of decades . we also created a series of original video commercials to promote each month 's content , and asked our fans to share them far and wide . rabbit rabbit 's material is varied often lighter in spirit and more pop than sleepytime###gorilla###museum 's music , but sometimes driven and experimental as well . sometimes a song reflects what they 're up to during the month they recorded it . merci vielmal , which they recorded while they were touring###europe as part of the guitarist fred###frith 's band cosa brava , is about crossing linguistic and geographical###boundaries , and was recorded in trains and backstage at clubs in france and switzerland . their most recent offering , the laconic before the sun , is a collaboration with the chicago band cheer accident . thymme jones , a member of cheer accident , said that his group planned to adopt the rabbit rabbit radio subscription###model , starting in september . the instant i saw what they were doing , said mr . jones , who was a subscriber from the start , the light###bulb went off , and i thought , 'we 're going to rip off this idea . ' for us , it will be an interesting way of doing things###differently after 25 years of releasing physical discs . and if my math is right , we have tons of people on our mailing###list . john schaefer , the host of several radio shows on wnyc that focus on new music , said the subscription###model struck him as a plausible way for some musicians to supplement their performing income . if radiohead did this , mr . schaefer wrote in an e mail , it would go through the roof . if a local indie band did it , it might still be terrific , but i 'm not sure how successful it would be . what makes it work , i think , for carla and matthias is that they have enough of a following to get them started and then the resulting word of mouth will hopefully sustain it . ms . kihlstedt and mr . bossi have looked at other models as well , including those like kickstarter and artistshare , which encourage fans to provide money for musicians' projects . ms . kilhstedt used kickstarter to raise###money for a song###cycle , necessary monsters , and found the experience valuable , even though , she said , she went overboard with the gifts she sent to fans who contributed . ( contributors to that project , she said , were also given free subscriptions to rabbit rabbit radio . ) they are currently working with fractured atlas , an organization that helps independent artists raise###money and organize their business###affairs . we 're about to release our 20th issue , mr . bossi said , pursuing his magazine analogy . and we 've gotten better at working fast and meeting our deadlines . this fall we 're going to spend some time getting the word out in a bigger way , and pushing it to the next level .
london one of the largest manufacturing plants in scotland will be closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs , the chemical giant ineos said on wednesday , after employees there declined to accept an ownership plan involving pension and job###cuts . a spokesman for ineos said the company told its employees at grangemouth that it would permanently shut the petrochemical plant at the facility on the firth of forth and that liquidation will start in a week . the move would eventually mean that half of the , 300 workers at the site would lose their jobs , said richard longden , the ineos spokesman . another 650 jobs are at the nearby oil###refinery , which is a joint###venture between ineos and petrochina , the large state###owned###company . ineos , which is privately###owned , shut down operations at both plants on oct . 17 while workers , represented by the unite union , were considering the company 's proposals . ineos said about half the workers accepted the plan . the union said a majority were against it . pat rafferty , head of the scotland branch of unite , said the union was still in talks with the company . we have made further proposals in a last ditch effort to stave off these catastrophic job###losses , he said in a statement . for ineos 's part , the joint###venture called petroineos will now decide whether to restart the refinery , the company said in a statement . this will be primarily dependent on removal of the threat of industrial###action . in a note to clients on wednesday , analysts at energy aspects in london said , the closure of the petrochemical site will involve 700 800 job###losses so further industrial###action seems quite probable . the announcement puts pressure on the british and scottish governments to intervene , though neither appears to have easy options . even at this late###stage , i urge ineos to continue dialogue with the work force , and government will offer help and support with this , edward davey , britain 's secretary for energy and climate###change , said in a statement . the closure of the plant is a major issue for the scottish###government , which is heading toward a referendum on independence next year . grangemouth is scotland 's only petroleum refinery , normally producing about 80 percent of products like jet###fuel consumed in the country . most analysts believe that closure of the refinery might cause short###term disruptions but that over time the refined###products could easily be supplied by other refineries in europe that have plenty of spare###capacity . rob west , an analyst at bernstein research , noted that europe 's largest refining hub is just across the southern north###sea at rotterdam . ineos 's willingness to scrap a key industrial facility shows how difficult the refining and petrochemical situation is in europe . mr . west estimated that there is 15 percent overcapacity in the european refining industry , while the situation in petrochemicals is worse . european refiners are being squeezed by weak demand as well as product imports from the united###states and the middle###east , according to richard mallinson , an analyst at energy aspects . another concern is that the key forties pipeline , which transports oil from about 80 fields in the north###sea and is powered by steam from a generating plant at grangemouth , might be disrupted . but so far ineos has kept the generating###plant open . ineos had earlier threatened to shut down the petrochemical plant by 2017 unless employees accepted a survival plan involving pension cuts and some layoffs . the company also asked for 125 million , or 202 million , in support from the british and scottish governments , mostly in the form of loan###guarantees , to build a terminal to import from the united###states low cost raw###materials for petrochemical production at the plant . ineos asked workers to accept a shift away from a pension###plan with defined benefits to a lower cost retirement###savings plan with defined contributions , akin to an american style 401 ( k . employees who accepted were also promised up to , 000 as incentives . the company says that it is now paying 65 percent of employees' salaries into the pension###plan . as for the refinery , there still seems to be some prospect that it will survive , although it may require###substantial capital investment at a time when most analysts think that several more european refineries will close . one source of protection may be petrochina of beijing , the ineos partner , which may not want to lose an asset in the west . we hope a consensus can be reached between ineos , the unite union and other parties involved , petrochina said tuesday in a statement .
the new mexico supreme###court unanimously affirmed on thursday the right of same sex###partners to marry in the state , reasoning that the protections and responsibilities that result from the marital relationship shall apply###equally to them and to opposite###sex###couples . with the ruling , which takes###effect immediately , new mexico becomes one of 17 states and the district of columbia to permit same###sex###marriage . thirty three states limit marriage###to###opposite###sex###couples . today 's decision is a powerful affirmation that same sex couples are equal members of new mexico 's diverse culture and must be given the same legal###protections and respect as other families , shannon price minter , legal director of the national###center###for###lesbian###rights , which joined the american###civil###liberties###union to bring the case to court , said in a statement . in a written###opinion , the court 's five justices agreed that marriage rights for same sex couples are guaranteed under the equal###protection###clause of the new mexico constitution , amended in 1972 to state that equality of rights under law shall not be denied on account of the sex of any person . justices weighed this amendment against the opposition 's argument that prohibiting same###sex###marriage was necessary to protect the government 's overriding interest of responsible procreation and childrearing . the justices said in their opinion that such interest played no role in the development of the state 's marriage regulations . its purpose , they contended , is to bring stability and order to the legal relationship of committed couples by defining their responsibilities to one another , their children if they choose to have them , and to their property . procreation , wrote justice edward l . chavez , author of the opinion , has never been a condition of marriage under new mexico law , as evidenced by the fact that the aged , the infertile and those who choose not to have children are not precluded from marrying . the decision capped years of failed###attempts in the state legislature to have same###sex###marriage legalized , or banned . in march , six same sex couples filed a lawsuit , bringing to court a battle that , until then , had been governed primarily by political interests . in august , a district judge ordered the clerks in bernalillo###county which encompasses the state 's most populous###city , albuquerque and santa###fe###county , which includes the state 's capital , to begin###issuing marriage###licenses to same sex###partners . the 33 county###clerks in new mexico intervened , asking the state supreme###court to resolve the issue . among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit were ona porter and miriam rand , who have been together for 26 years and have three children . after the supreme###court decision became public on thursday , ms . rand said our kids get to feel they matter both legally and by name . gov . susana###martinez , a republican , chose to stay away from the dispute , although she has publicly taken the position that marriage should be between a man and a woman . on thursday , she talked about a proposal to roll out high###tech research and development###programs , and issued no comment on the court 's ruling . the justices heard###arguments on oct . 23 spectators packed three rooms in the historic territorial courthouse in santa###fe . by then , eight county###clerks had begun granting marriage###licenses###to###same###sex###couples . according to the state 's chapter of the a.c.l.u. , more than , 000 such couples have already been married in new mexico . an appeal of thursday 's ruling is impossible , because it was issued by the state 's highest###court and is specific to the state 's constitution .
you have to make me like you , montgomery said . wait . there is an addendum . you have to make me like you fast . his time is valuable , so after pressing play , montgomery needs to see tackles broken and linebackers fooled and yards after contact . he needs to see acceleration and elusiveness and something special . he needs to be given a reason to tell his boss , ozzie###newsome , that baltimore must draft this running back even though the ravens start a pro###bowler , ray###rice . this is how the team came to select bernard pierce last april , trading up in the third round to take him . in montgomery 's estimation , pierce was more explosive in the first 20 yards of runs than any other back he had seen since the two time rushing champion edgerrin###james , who was drafted in . like james , pierce is 6 feet and about 220 sculptured pounds , and the comparisons do not end there . pierce does not welcome contact as much as invite it , squaring his shoulders to barrel over defenders , then sprint past them . his physical style , with a flourish of speed , serves as an ideal and , perhaps , necessary complement to the slippery , stockier rice , who understands the value of having a dynamic backup in the current n.f.l . climate . i do n't have to inflict that kind of pounding on my body when you 've got a guy who 's 220 pounds or more and coming at you with downhill action , rice said , adding when you 're spelling yourself , one thing you 're afraid about is , 'is the offense going to run the same ? ' you have to play the baltimore###ravens the same when bernard pierce comes into the game . more than half of pierce 's 135 rushing attempts during the regular###season and the playoffs have come since jim###caldwell replaced cam###cameron as offensive###coordinator . in two of baltimore 's three postseason victories against indianapolis and at new england pierce gained more yards , and on fewer carries , than rice . pierce 's . 3 yards per rush ranks first this postseason among running###backs . we liked him a lot , ravens coach john###harbaugh said , but i do n't think we thought he 'd be this good of a player . harbaugh is seeing a more evolved version of the player and the person who at 16 was sent to glen###mills , a residential###school outside philadelphia for juveniles referred by courts . pierce said he was young and immature then , with a coterie of troublemaking friends . his role in a brawl at his high###school , lower###merion , landed him at glen###mills , where students were held to a strict###code###of###conduct . the acclimation was difficult . he would skip class . he would leave campus . he trusted few . but pierce bonded with kevin###owens , his football###coach , and rick badanjek , the running###backs###coach . badanjek encouraged him to join the track team , to start power###lifting . badanjek said he felt , at times , like a surrogate###father pierce , raised mostly by his mother and his grandmother , rarely saw his birth###father , who died in a 2008 car###accident . whenever he flouted the rules , refused to behave , badanjek would call pierce 's mother , tammy , in front of him . you 're not listening to me you 've got to listen somebody , badanjek recalled telling him . it took a long time of me just staying on him , telling him , 'this is the way it 's got to be , this is the way it 's going to be it ca n't be your way . ' he came to understand that . owens said he detected a change in pierce when he opted to stay for a second year , his senior year , at glen###mills . that 's very unusual , owens said . we build a new football###team every year . pierce 's decision , owens said , showed he realized how much he had benefited from glen###mills 's structure . several colleges recruited pierce , but none harder , owens said , than temple , whose defensive###coordinator at the time , mark d'onofrio , watched pierce as often as n.c.a.a . rules allowed . at a county track meet during pierce 's junior year , d'onofrio hand###timed his 100 meter dash in . 6 seconds . d'onofrio called al golden , temple 's coach at the time , immediately . for such a big###guy , just the way he ran , to see that flat out breakaway speed on top of everything else that he had was unbelievable , said d'onofrio , who is now golden 's defensive###coordinator at the university of miami . when you watch his football tape , he was a football###player who ran track not the opposite . in three seasons at temple , pierce rushed for , 570 yards and 53 touchdowns , and staying close to home allowed him to maintain his relationships with badanjek and owens . they communicate every so often now , mostly through text###messages , but badanjek traveled to baltimore for the ravens' game dec . 2 against pittsburgh . pierce said badanjek rarely praised him , but that night badanjek told him how proud he was of him . i said 'it 's all coming###true for you , is n't it ? ' badanjek said , recounting the conversation . 'it 's all coming together for you . you 're where you want to be . you always claimed you were a man , but you never were . now you are .

london spain international goalkeeper pepe###reina has left liverpool for a season###long###loan at serie a club napoli , but said in an open###letter to fans of the five times european###champions it was not his decision to leave anfield . reina , 30 , who joined liverpool in , said he wanted to extend his contract at anfield and was not consulted before the loan move was agreed . although it was not my decision to leave i will accept it . if i have one regret , it is the way that i am leaving , wrote reina , who made nearly 400 appearances for liverpool in all competitions and has played 28 times for spain . it is only natural that i would be disappointed that the liverpool management agreed to loan me to napoli without telling me first . i thought that i deserved better than that even though i understand that difficult###decisions have to be taken in football . reina , the first choice at liverpool until last season , might well have found himself on the bench for much of the coming campaign following the signing of simon###mignolet from sunderland . the spaniard said he was looking forward to the napoli challenge and linking up again with his former liverpool boss rafa benitez . i have to look forward to a new challenge with rafa benitez , who i consider to be the best manager i have worked with , and i am fortunate to be going from one great club to another , he wrote . napoli remind me in many ways of the liverpool i found in , in all the affection they have shown me on my arrival , in having an ambitious###project , even in coinciding and working with benitez again .
berlin hamburg sv sacked coach thorsten###fink on tuesday after their 6 2 demolition by borussia###dortmund on saturday compounded a bad###start to the season . reserve###team coaches rodolfo cardoso and otto addo had been put in temporary charge , the club said . i had very good relations with thorsten###fink and i hope this will stay that way but given the situation we are in we decided last night to go our separate###ways , sports###director oliver kreuzer told a news conference . the 45 year old fink , who angered club bosses after leaving the team following the heavy###loss to join his family in munich , had taken over in 2011 from swiss side fc###basel . after a bad###start to the current campaign and heavy###defeats to dortmund and hoffenheim , hamburg are in 15th place on four points from five games , having conceded 15 goals so far for the league 's worst defence . hamburg , who were hoping for a europa###league spot finish before the season start , are the only team to have played in the bundesliga every season since its creation in . rodolfo cardoso and otto addo will take over this afternoon 's training . obviously it is in our interest to present a successor very soon . there are a few names we are considering , kreuzer said . he said fink had been surprised , shocked and disappointed by the decision which he did not expect . but i did not have 100 percent confidence in him that the team with him in charge could show the necessary power to turn it around . former argentina international cardoso had also briefly taken over as caretaker###coach in 2011 before returning to the under 23 team . former ghana international addo was until tuesday hamburg 's under 19 coach . i am proud to have worked here for two years , fink told northern german radio ndr earlier on tuesday , confirming his departure . i coached a great club . now there is still time to reach their goals , even with a different coach .
berlin kevin###prince###boateng continued his stellar start to life at schalke 04 by helping them secure a third straight win since he joined the ruhr###valley club but his talismanic credentials will be given their sternest test against bayern###munich on saturday . the ghana international , who joined schalke just three weeks###ago , scored one goal and helped orchestrate a 3 0 win over steaua###bucharest in the club 's opening champions###league group match on wednesday . it was schalke 's third win without conceding since boateng , whose powerful midfield presence has formed a strong bond between defence and attack , signed from ac###milan . kevin prince does not shy away from a challenge easily , schalke coach jens keller told###reporters . he always makes himself available and demands the ball . he talks to the team and leads it and it is very clear that he has already become a very important player in this team . boateng 's arrival could not have come at a better time for schalke , who are missing injured leading striker klaas###jan###huntelaar and defensive rock kyriakos###papadopoulos . the 26 year old german###born midfielder , whose half###brother jerome plays for bayern and germany , was welcomed with open arms despite his past spell at rivals borussia###dortmund , and has quickly become a crowd favourite . his experience , with stints at tottenham###hotspur and portsmouth before joining milan in , has proved###invaluable at a key###moment for schalke , who are looking to re establish themselves as a major force . we have got every reason to be satisfied with this win , a smiling boateng told###reporters on wednesday . everyone in the dressing###room is very happy with this excellent team performance . we know we have some tough games coming up but we are prepared . the boateng effect has restored schalke 's bundesliga ambitions after they failed to win any of their first three league###games before the arrival of the player once branded a 'bad###boy' for his off pitch antics . it is great for us to have played three straight###games without conceding a goal , added julian###draxler , who set up boateng for schalke 's second goal in the 78th minute before scoring the third himself . our game with kevin is coming together and is becoming better . we are on a very good road . however , treble winners bayern , two points behind leaders dortmund , are riding high after a solid 3 0 champions###league win over cska###moscow on tuesday , boosting their confidence as they look to extend their 30 game###unbeaten###run in the league . dortmund , still licking their wounds after a 2 1 defeat at napoli in the same competition , travel to nuremberg in the hope of extending their perfect###start to the league###season with a sixth###straight victory .
it stretches for nearly two miles along the oceanfront , block after block of weed filled , trash strewn lots , occasionally###interrupted by a cluster of buildings . it is the arverne urban###renewal area in the rockaways , for a quarter century the site of a repeatedly thwarted effort to build a " new town " of homes , parks and shopping###centers . the arverne project suffered its latest blow two years###ago when the developer of the most recent plan for the site , oceanview associates of manhattan , pulled out , citing a poor###economy in which to market the kind of vast development it was contemplating a 1 . 5 billion complex of 7 , 500 apartments priced to sell or rent to families with annual###incomes of 45 , 000 to 80 , 000 . stores , movie###theaters and a refurbished boardwalk and beach were also part of the package . previous obstacles to construction on the site had included the city 's fiscal###crisis of the 1970 's , sharp cutbacks in federal housing subsidies and local###opposition to various schemes . the result was that although nearly 4 , 000 deteriorated buildings were demolished in the late 1960 's , very little of the envisioned new housing was built to replace them , and the area became one of america 's most notorious examples of redevelopment gone nowhere . but the dinkins administration insists that the arverne project is not a nightmare of failure but a dream deferred . " the project is still alive , " valerie jo bradley , a spokeswoman for the city 's department of housing preservation and development , said last week . " we 're working on a phasing plan , " she said , referring to what other officials have described as a future " series of discrete , smaller###projects by separate developers within the urban###renewal area , rather than proceeding with a single master developer . " kathleen dunn , the agency 's deputy###commissioner for development , said that two companies ehrenkrantz eckstut and vollmer associates have been retained as engineering and planning consultants to help determine such issues as where in the vast renewal tract the first such project should go and how much housing to " put out on the market " as part of that phase . ms . dunn could not say how long it might be before the city could move to the next stage requesting yet another round of proposals from potential developers in an area where schemes have come and gone like the nearby tides . joseph p . fried neighborhood report rockaway update
encountering steve###martin at a party can be an uncertain proposition . maybe you 'll###end up talking to him about developments in art , politics or the weather . or maybe he 'll ask if you want to add lyrics to some banjo tunes he 's been playing around with , an invitation that leads to your making a record together and solidifies a creative union between the two of you . that may sound like the more unlikely outcome , but it is in fact how edie###brickell , the singer###songwriter , ended up working with mr . martin , the cultural multihyphenate and sometime bluegrass musician , on love has come for you , a new album that rounder###records is to release on tuesday . like its origin###story , the whole project can seem a little improbable two performers with seemingly not much in common , collaborating on music that does n't quite sound like anything either has made before . it is mystifying to its creators , too , but also satisfying in a way that they hope listeners will appreciate . as mr . martin described his partnership with ms . brickell a few weeks###ago , the whole thing was a giant accident that , in our view , turned out to be very rewarding to us . on a march morning , they were sitting a few seats apart in the otherwise empty house of town###hall in manhattan . mr . martin , 67 , who has lately applied his well honed banjo skills to two bluegrass albums , the crow and rare###bird alert , the latter recorded with the steep###canyon###rangers , was playfully professorial , wearing###glasses and striped socks that poked out from his pants . ms . brickell , 47 , best known for her work with the alternative###rock band new bohemians , was dressed in a scarf and tall boots , and spoke in a gentle , ethereal voice . though the two had been working together for several months , there was a sense that they were still getting to know each other , and ms . brickell said she was sometimes intimidated by mr . martin 's range of abilities , from comedy to essays to playwriting . i was shy around him , she said . when i first started###singing in front of him , i did n't want to sing anything that he did n't like . and i did n't know what he liked . their arrangement arose from casual conversations in which ms . brickell had complimented mr . martin on his bluegrass records , and he offered her a melody he 'd composed but for which he had been unable to write lyrics . listening to mr . martin 's slow string plucking , ms . brickell began to improvise the opening###lines lonely , broken feeling###lonely , to my soul that became the duo 's first song , sun 's gonna shine . in the beginning , ms . brickell said she was afraid to tell mr . martin exactly what she was singing . i was looking at a tadpole of a song , she explained , and needed to let it grow into a hoppy little number before i shared its essence . but mr . martin was satisfied with this initial###effort , and he gave ms . brickell another tune , faster and rhythmic , which she played at home while she was cooking and for which , she said , the lyrics flowed out instantly when you get to ashevilletell me how you 're doin'when mr . martin heard her lyrics , for when you get to asheville , which became the leadoff track of love has come for you , he said , i thought 'oh ! good . ' we 're not writing old fashioned pretend songs . we 're writing contemporary###songs with sort of an old flavor . the banjo is evocative of something in the past , and these lyrics are evocative of something new . as he and ms . brickell were fine###tuning their demo tracks and passing them back and forth electronically , mr . martin played them for a friend , the musician peter###asher , at another party . mr . asher , who was one half of the british pop###duo peter and gordon and has worked as a manager , producer and record###label executive with artists like james###taylor and linda###ronstadt , suggested to mr . martin that these songs could make for an unorthodox album . you did n't have to restrict yourself to the bluegrass palette , which is a relatively formal one , mr . asher recalled in a telephone interview . it 's like if you 're writing baroque chamber###music , you only have a certain number of instruments to choose between . you do n't think , what about a few electronic parts ? what about a fender###rhodes keyboard sound ? or what , indeed , about a drummer ? one e mail exchange later with mr . martin , mr . asher found himself the producer of love has come for you . on close###inspection , the album reveals ways in which mr . martin and ms . brickell are not entirely dissimilar . in addition to their overlapping social###circle ( ms . brickell is married to paul###simon , a longtime###friend of mr . martin 's , they both were born in texas . while mr . martin moved away from waco at a young###age , ms . brickell was strongly###influenced by her upbringing in the oak###cliff neighborhood of dallas .
baltimore there 's still more than half a season left to play , so there 's no reason for the baltimore###orioles to become overly excited about their current###situation . then again , what harm is there in enjoying the moment ? chris###tillman took a two hitter into the seventh###inning , chris###davis hit his major###league leading 22nd home###run and the orioles blanked the boston###red###sox 2 0 friday###night in a duel between the top two teams in the al###east . manny###machado had three hits for the orioles , who have won five of six including the first two in this four game series . baltimore moved within 1 games of the division leading red###sox , the closest the orioles have been to first place since may . obviously you want to continue to play as well as you can , no matter if you 're at home or on the road , if it 's early or late in the season , davis said . but we know we 're close . and any time a division rival comes in , you want to try to take as many games as you possibly can . i think we 're pleased with the way things have gone so far , and hopefully we can continue it . tillman ( 7 2 ) allowed three hits and four walks in six plus innings . the right hander permitted only one runner to get past second base in winning his third straight start . after bouncing between the majors and minor###leagues last year , tillman has emerged as baltimore 's most steady starter . i said it in the spring , manager buck###showalter said . chris came in full aware that he was out of options . but he pitched like a guy who had three and did n't want to go to ( triple a ) norfolk . and that shows a lot of maturity , because he wanted to be a guy for us this year and he has been so far . after jose iglesias chased tillman with a leadoff double in the seventh , darren o'day got three successive outs . tommy###hunter worked a perfect eighth and jim###johnson completed the three hitter to earn his 24th save . making his first career appearance at camden###yards , 36 year old ryan###dempster ( 4 7 ) gave up two runs and five hits in 7 2 3 innings . he was victimized by a lack of offensive support the red###sox have gone 15 straight innings without scoring a run , and in this one they got only one hit after the fourth . the guy just pitched his tail off over there , dempster said . sometimes you just get outpitched . there is really nothing you can do about . we do n't get shut out very often . it 's kind of a rarity . ... i felt good about my outing , for sure . i felt like i pitched well . the other guy just pitched better than me . boston has lost two in a row for the first time since may 28 29 against philadelphia , and its streak of winning four consecutive###series is over . the red###sox are 1 4 against the orioles this season and have won only four of the last 17 games between the clubs . davis led off the second inning with an opposite field drive into the left###field seats , his sixth homer in the last eight games against the red###sox . i think chris knows he does n't have to get into pull mode to be effective , showalter said . that 's been good for him . baltimore made it 2 0 in the third . nate###mclouth walked , took second on a single , advanced on a fly ball and scored when adam jones reached on a two out dribbler down the third base###line . tillman issued a walk in each of the first four innings but kept the red###sox at bay . after boston got runners on the corners with one out in the fourth , will middlebrooks hit a short fly to right and david ross struck out . we did get a couple of guys on base over the course of the game , but it was a night where we could n't bunch anything together , red###sox manager john###farrell said . he did issue the four walks to give us a couple of opportunities . still , when you take ( iglesias ) out of the mix , where he got two out of three hits in that ballgame , tillman did a good job of keeping us in check . notes machado hit two doubles to increase his majors leading total to . he also extended his hitting###streak to 12 games , a new career###high . ... the red###sox recalled rhp rubby###de###la###rosa from triple a pawtucket and optioned rhp alex###wilson to the same club . ... the orioles recalled rhp jake###arrieta to fill out their weary bullpen . ... after being designated###for###assignment monday , boston inf pedro ciriaco was traded to san###diego for a player to be named or cash . ... john###lackey will start for boston on saturday against baltimore and freddy garcia . lackey is 11 4 lifetime against the orioles and garcia is 10 4 vs . boston . ... j.j . hardy went hitless against dempster and is 2 for 30 lifetime against the right hander . ... iglesias has hit in 15 straight###games in which he has a plate###appearance . ... the orioles reinstated lhp tsuyoshi wada ( elbow ) from the 60 day disabled###list and optioned him to norfolk . ... mclouth stole his 23rd base , tying a career###high .

gullane , scotland wily spaniard miguel###angel jimenez led the way and tiger###woods ground out a second round 71 to stay right in the mix as the british###open turned into a dogfight at muirfield on friday . the early starters enjoyed the best conditions on another sun drenched day but the course bared its teeth in the afternoon to throw up a congested leaderboard heading into the weekend . jimenez , 49 , followed his opening 68 with a###level par , the cigar loving spaniard drawing on all his experience to mix two birdies with two bogeys in a rock steady round to finish at three under . i like to feel the pressure . as long as you can handle that , it 's no problem , he told###reporters . i feel###comfortable . world number one woods made two birdies and two bogeys on the front nine and sank a 10 foot###putt on the final green to finish on two under par along with briton lee###westwood , henrik###stenson of sweden ( 70 ) and american dustin###johnson . briton martin###laird , spaniard rafael###cabrera###bello , american zach###johnson and angel cabrera of argentina were the only other players to finish under par and will start the third round two behind jimenez . woods collected birdies at the third and fifth holes but bogeys on the fourth , eighth and 11th halted his charge and the american waved his putter in frustration after wasting a birdie chance at the 12th . he maintained his concentration , however , to par the next five holes and a fine approach###shot set up a birdie on the last which he celebrated with a trademark fist pump . towards the middle part of my round i lost the pace and was blowing it past the hole , said 14 times major winner woods . but i finally got it fixed at the end . just got to continue plodding along . continue being patient , putting the ball in the right spots and trying . we 're not going to get a lot of opportunities out there but when i have i 've been able to capitalize and hopefully i can continue doing that . westwood , seeking a long###overdue first major championship , took advantage of a hot putter to pick up six birdies over the first 12 holes . he briefly moved to five under but had to settle for a round of 68 after three bogeys over the closing stretch . i was pleased to be five under through , said westwood . i was playing some great stuff and it was just getting harder as the holes progressed , tougher to score , tougher to get it close . the finish is tough , 16 , 17 , 18 are playing hard . so it 's like most major championships , it 's a grind out there . cabrera , twice a major champion and runner up in this year 's u.s . masters , got to four under after 13 holes but dropped shots at the 14th , 15th and 18th to fall back . zach###johnson , the overnight leader after an opening , bogeyed four holes on the front nine but got back to five under before giving away another four shots including a double###bogey six at the treacherous 15th . pars on the closing holes were not easy to achieve with the greens speeding up throughout the afternoon . as the players struggled to cope with the conditions , the projected cut mark increased###steadily throughout the day and was finally made at eight over . world number two rory###mcilroy will miss the weekend 's action after slumping to a 75 and a 12 over par total while former world number one luke###donald finished 10 over , a 72 failing to repair the damage of his opening . u.s . open###champion justin###rose and former british###open winners tom###watson , nick###faldo and david###duval also missed the cut . only four players broke 70 westwood , south african charl###schwartzel , american kyle###stanley ( 69 ) and briton paul###lawrie .

alpha###house , the first original###series from amazon , may be about four fictional scandal clad senators living in a group house in washington , but verisimilitude is a foundational element . the russell###senate###office###building has been painstakingly recreated at kaufman###astoria###studios in queens , right down to the hideaways and mail slots . and while there are quite a few other shows set in the milieu of beltway politics , there is none other in which barack###obama is president and mitch###mcconnell is the senate minority###leader , as they are here . but there is one dead giveaway that we are not in the version of washington that we read about every day the republicans and democrats on alpha###house actually speak to one another . john###goodman plays gil john biggs , a basketball coach turned republican senator who is under attack from the right by a tea###party candidate . one of his housemates , senator robert bettencourt , played by clark###johnson , comes under investigation by the senate ethics committee , which is run by carly armiston , a strident democrat played by cynthia###nixon . in the senate dining###room , as senator biggs tries to send over a fancy bottle of wine , a waiter named lloyd tells him , she thinks you are up to something , senator . i am up to somethin' , lloyd . comity . comity ! senator biggs says . means gettin' along with the other side . he and his sworn political enemy eventually share frank conversation and far too much wine . the reason the scene works as comedy is that it sounds so far fetched , but there are other reasons alpha###house has a shot at finding the funny . garry###trudeau , the pulitzer###prize winning cartoonist of doonesbury , conceived and wrote the series , and it stars mr . goodman , who played big and fun on the sitcom roseanne . he brings a darkly comedic reputation from his film work with the coen###brothers as well , thanks to characters like the dude 's wingman in the big lebowski . mr . goodman has a role in the coming coen###brothers film inside###llewyn###davis , but said he has his reasons for saying yes to alpha###house . i 'm working in new york , which i love , he said . i am doing a show with garry###trudeau , and we are doing something that has n't been done before . it both has and it has n't . for amazon , it is certainly a first . the first three episodes will become available friday to all amazon customers , and then a new episode will be available each week thereafter to amazon###prime members . given that alpha###house is a series set in contemporary washington and delivered on the web not through broadcast or cable comparisons to netflix 's house of cards are bound to crop up , though this does n't seem to concern mr . trudeau at all . that 's a drama , and we are making a comedy , he said by phone . but i was as startled as anyone about the impact that 'house of cards' made . it certainly came out with a roar , and i found it very watchable and engaging . mr . trudeau conceived alpha###house about five years###ago , but it ended up in a drawer until he and jonathan###alter , the journalist and author , were on a road trip for the 2012 new hampshire primary , when mr . alter convinced him that there was room in the market for a funny , well told comedy about politics . mr . alter brought the show to amazon and now serves as an executive###producer , along with elliot webb and mr . trudeau , spending much of his time making sure the show nails the details of beltway life . mr . alter said that coming behind house of cards , which won a directing emmy for its creator , david###fincher , is a happy coincidence . i think what happened with 'house of cards' is great for our show , mr . alter said , standing in one of the senate offices on set . it legitimized online###viewing and lets people know that there is quality programming on the web . for mr . goodman , it feels like , well , a television show . it 's all the same to me , he said , shadowboxing with a door###frame as he warmed up for a scene . the distribution is out of my control . speaking of which , bill murray played a disgraced senator who was hauled off to jail in the pilot . he has been tough to pin down since . he is scheduled to be in the final###episode , but he keeps us on our toes because it 's never quite clear what 's going on in bill 's world , mr . trudeau said . we call him 'the unicorn . ' we think he actually gets to the set by magical###thinking . ( he actually drove himself there for an early###morning call during the pilot shoot , surprising everyone when he walked in . )
wayne , pa . with the television in her pizzeria showing an endless###loop of the boston manhunt on friday , bessie kontis glanced up at scenes of the quasi military lockdown and shuddered . after something like that happens , they should stop all visas , for crying out loud , said ms . kontis , 58 , who owns new wayne pizza with her husband , alex . it 's insane . it just angers me . ms . kontis was born in greece and immigrated to the united###states as a child , but when two men of chechen heritage were identified as the suspects in the fatal boston###marathon bombings , her usually broad views about immigration became colored by concerns for national###security . that is who 's coming in , she said . we do n't know what kind of people they are . the bottom line is we have to stop being goody###goody americans . as a national###debate over major immigration###reform begins in congress , some opponents are pointing to the boston bombings as cause for concern about expanding visa programs and offering millions of illegal###immigrants a path to citizenship . on friday , senator charles e . grassley , a senior iowa republican on the committee debating the plan , which is proposed by a bipartisan group of eight senators , said the terrorist###bombings should figure into the debate . some conservative###commentators and congressional republicans want to shift the focus away from economic and humanitarian concerns to border security and the potential###threat from terrorists entering the country . how successful their efforts turn out to be , and whether boston slows momentum for change , could depend on how many citizens express views like ms . kontis 's . but judging by a sampling of voters in one politically###divided region , the western###suburbs of philadelphia , the boston bombings may be an imperfect test###case for opponents of reform . in interviews friday###night , as the denouement of the manhunt played out in the hours when people gathered in taverns or strolled the streets on a pleasant evening , many mentioned that the two brothers linked to the attacks dzhokhar a . tsarnaev , 19 , who was captured friday , and tamerlan###tsarnaev , 26 , who was killed earlier had arrived in the country a decade earlier , with a father who claimed asylum because of the conflict in their homeland . they could hardly have been identified by more vigilant border###control , people said . you ca n't###stop people who came into the u.s . who 10 years later do bad###things , said andrew factor , 26 , an investment###adviser who stopped outside his office on the main###street here . we 're supposed to screen for terrorists when kids are 9 and ? nonetheless , the details of the tsarnaev family 's odyssey may become lost in a larger debate over immigration###policy , an issue that evokes visceral reactions . two republican###senators favoring reform , lindsey###graham of south###carolina and john###mccain of arizona , warned friday of bringing boston into the debate and insisted an overhaul would tighten security by helping us identify exactly who has entered our country and who has left . but that message was not always embraced . i 'm a little more of an extremist now after what happened in boston , said greg ricker , 41 , a stockbroker , as he stepped outside the flying pig saloon in malvern for a cigarette . i think we should just stop letting people in . like nearby wayne , malvern is part of a suburban belt that has grown more democratic in recent###elections . attitudes toward immigration###reform seem to be changing , in part along generational lines . frank cunningham , a 27 year old accountant , said that he , unlike his father , favors a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal###immigrants in the country . the way i was raised , my dad says , 'if you come into the country illegally , you do n't deserve to be here , ' mr . cunningham said . but i 'm wondering who is going to do those jobs ? gary burnett , 35 , said he favored a path to citizenship and expanded permanent###resident visas for those waiting outside the country , because the nation is already part of a global###economy . as a software###engineer , he said , i compete with the entire###world already . i have to be able to do the work of at least three people in asia to compete . he thought the potential that some immigrants might turn out to be terrorists was a red###herring . melvin cook , 57 , who was buying a pizza , went further . he accused politicians of exploiting the boston bombing . they 're trying to put fear into us of immigrants , he said . mr . cook , a truck###driver , said of illegal###immigrants , the jobs they 're getting , nobody wants .
as the health###care bill that was to become known as obamacare was making its way through congress in , senator jon###kyl , republican of arizona , sought to block the requirement that health insurers cover a minimum set of health###benefits determined by the federal###government . i do n't need maternity care , said senator kyl , who retired from the senate last year at the age of . requiring that on my insurance policy is something that i do n't need and will make the policy more expensive . mr . kyl 's proposed###amendment embodied the conservative view the affordable###care###act that passed###congress in 2010 is an unacceptable intrusion into the private decisions of american families and businesses . the senate###finance###committee , by a vote of 14 to , rejected the amendment , opting for a different approach that could change , in subtle but profound ways , the nature of the american social###contract . pregnant###women , across the country and anywhere along the income spectrum , will for the first time have guaranteed access to health###insurance offering a minimum###standard of care that will help keep their babies alive . the benefit may seem narrow . but it offers the best opportunity in a generation to tackle one of the united###states' most notorious stigmas an intractably high infant###mortality###rate that hardly fits one of the richest , most technologically###advanced nations on earth . if it succeeds , it could provide americans with an alternative view of how government can serve society . i have brought up infant###mortality before as a marker of the drawbacks inherent in the united###states' model of relatively low###taxes and modest government , leaving more social###outcomes to the sway of market forces . the united###states was not always at the bottom of the charts . four decades###ago , americans lost proportionately fewer babies than average among industrialized###nations . the united###states lost more than france but fewer than germany , more than sweden but fewer than luxembourg . by , however , virtually every other advanced country had surpassed the united###states . in portugal , 2.5 babies out of every , 000 born###alive died before they were a year old . in finland and japan the figure was . 3 . though the united###states has made progress recently , it still lost . 1 . among members of the organization for economic###cooperation and development , only mexico , chile and turkey did worse . it is unclear to what extent obamacare might help prevent these earliest of deaths . infant###mortality is a complex###problem . the frustration of hundreds###of###thousands of americans fruitlessly trying to buy health###insurance on the new federal exchange raises legitimate questions about whether such a mind bogglingly complex reform can fulfill its main###purpose of providing near universal health###coverage . still , the experience of other countries not to say common###sense suggests that offering broad access###to###health###care to women before , during and after their pregnancy could help close the gap with the nation 's peers . this is a sea###change , said genevieve kenney , co director of the health###policy center at the urban###institute , a nonpartisan research center in washington . the needle could move . consider finland . mika gissler , a research professor at the national###institute for health and welfare in helsinki , told me that finland decided to take action against infant###mortality in the 1940s , when the country had a poor agrarian###economy . today the finnish government provides free prenatal###care to every woman who wants it . of every , 000 pregnant###women , some 997 including illegal###immigrants visit the maternity clinics 13 to 15 times during their pregnancy , on average . they are screened for risk factors . they learn about breast###feeding and how to care for their baby . fathers too , learn what to expect and how to contribute once their baby is born . partly as a consequence , the infant###mortality###rate has fallen to about one sixth of what it was in . mr . gissler notes that only . 7 births out of 100 are premature , about the same as a quarter of a century ago . in the united###states , such maternity care is rare . individual health policies usually do not cover pregnancy . fewer than two out of three pregnant###women in texas or maryland have even one prenatal###care visit in their first trimester . and almost 12 american babies out of 100 are born###prematurely , more than twice the rate in finland and 18 percent more than 25 years###ago . prenatal###care alone is not enough . the causes of the high###death###rate of american babies remain , to some extent , nebulous .
cleveland justin###masterson hopes his season is n't over , though the indians' ace realizes the possibility###exists . masterson will miss at least one start because of a strained left oblique , another blow to a team struggling to stay in playoff###contention . the right hander was pulled from monday 's game against baltimore in the second inning because of soreness in his left side and an mri on tuesday revealed the injury . cleveland manager terry###francona said masterson wo n't resume baseball activities until he 's pain free . an oblique injury takes some players four to six weeks to recover from , which would be too late for masterson to return . i do n't know , he said when asked if he could be done for the season . i 'm sure you get worst###case###scenario , whatever it is , that could always be the case . we 'll take a few days and continue to assess . when it 's based off how i feel , it makes it a little more difficult to say for sure what it 's going to be . my hope is to make a few more starts by the time the season 's over and be ready for the playoffs . francona does n't know if his no . 1 starter will take the mound again in . he 'll definitely miss a start , francona said . after that , you just do n't know . he 's going to miss a little time here . the hope would be it 's not the rest of the season . masterson 's injury is more bad###news for the indians , who have lost six of seven and fallen 3 games out of the second al wild###card spot . reaching the postseason will be even more difficult without their best pitcher . it could take a short amount of time or it could take little bit , masterson said . we 're hoping for the shortest bit of time . masterson , who made his first all star team this season , leads the indians in wins and is tied for first in the al with three shutouts . the right hander is 14 10 with a . 52 era in 29 starts . for now , he wo n't###pick up a ball until the pain is gone . it 's not any worse than it was yesterday , he said . i 've got a touch of soreness over there , maybe a little bit when i cough . hopefully that will go away in a few days . i 'm icing and resting and throwing some prayers out there . despite the fact the indians are playing poorly in their most crucial stretch of the season , francona is n't going to rush masterson back . we 'll go on symptoms , francona said . we ca n't let him start doing anything until he 's pain free . we 'll keep monitoring him and see how he 's progressing . we 're not going to do something that 's not in his best interests . masterson , listed at 6 foot 6 and 250 pounds , is managing to keep his sense###of###humor . asked if doctors found an mri tube big enough to fit him , he said , just barely . we almost went to the zoo . corey###kluber , who has been on the disabled###list since aug . 6 with a sprained right middle###finger , will start saturday in masterson 's spot against the new york mets .
boston jason###terry was upright again sunday###afternoon , his chin and his jump###shot in working###order , his conviction strong and his missions clear save the boston###celtics ' season . extend an era . if at all possible , irritate the knicks just a little bit more . it took five flicks of the wrist , in 66 seconds , to make it all possible . terry scored the celtics' last 9 points in overtime , delivering a 97 90 victory at td###garden , denying the knicks a sweep and sending the series back to new york for game . when he was finished , terry , whose nickname is jet , smiled and extended his arms into wings for a brief , celebratory flight . as long as there 's time on the clock , as long as there is another game , it 's an opportunity for me to do something special , terry said . for boston , this was poetic###justice repayment for the knicks' j . r . smith 's elbowing terry in the face in game . while smith served a one game suspension sunday , the knicks ultimately buckled and terry soared . the knicks erased a 20 point###deficit in the second half and a 5 point###deficit in the final###minutes of regulation , but there was little else to like after an afternoon in which they shot . 4 percent and produced just 10 assists . carmelo###anthony commandeered the offense , shooting 35 times , as if he intended to single handedly replace smith 's offense . but he converted just 10 of those shots and had 7 turnovers . i was trying to win the basketball game , said anthony , who finished with 36 points and was trying to complete the first playoff sweep of his career . it would have been a great feeling to close it out here in boston , so i was trying to do whatever i could to win the basketball game . as great a clutch shooter as anthony has been in his career , this was a day the knicks could have used smith 's uncanny touch . anthony missed three of four shots in overtime , including a rushed 3 pointer with 20 seconds###left and the knicks trailing , 93 90 . he missed his last five shots in regulation , including two attempts on the knicks' last possession , with the score tied , 84 84 . he also missed two free throws with 1 minute 50 seconds###left in the fourth###quarter and walked away shaking his head . when the game is on the line , you 're going to give the ball to no . 7 , raymond###felton said , referring to anthony . that 's what we 've been doing all year there 's no need to change it now . paul###pierce led the celtics with 29 points , his best game of the series by far , and kevin###garnett added 13 points and 17 rebounds in what might have been their final###home###game together . jeff green added 26 points . the celtics were perhaps seconds away from elimination and an off season of radical###change , but pierce said he never had any doubts . i already called my friends in new york yesterday , telling them i 'd be there for dinner , he said . terry , who was signed to replace ray###allen last summer , had been a bust in the series until sunday . he finished with 18 points , perhaps inspired by smith 's elbow . he was definitely vocal , coach doc###rivers said . someone said it yesterday maybe that elbow , who knows said it changed the events for all of us . definitely , jason###terry was angry that it happened . so the knicks left boston still in search of their first playoff###series victory in 13 years . they will try again wednesday###night at madison###square###garden . the sour finish overshadowed a thrilling second half comeback , spearheaded by anthony and felton , who scored 16 of his 27 points in a blistering third quarter rally . felton also gave the knicks their first and only lead of the afternoon , 84 82 , with an 18 footer with 18 left in the fourth . the knicks trailed by 19 points at halftime their biggest deficit of the series , by far having converted just 11 of 38 shots . 9 percent , with anthony going 3 for . he was beyond erratic , shooting air balls , picking up offensive fouls , committing five turnovers and negating a felton free###throw with a lane violation . terry put the celtics ahead for good on a pull up 3 pointer , for a 91 88 lead . anthony hit a jumper , but terry answered with a 13 foot fadeaway , then put the game away with two free throws . smith has been as indispensable as any knicks star this season , providing points , clutch shots , defense and fire . until sunday , he had played in every meaningful game sitting out only the last two regular###season###games . the suspension could not have come as a shock there was ample precedent but the ruling rankled the knicks all the same . i 'm not even going to comment on that , coach mike###woodson said before the game . not at all . under league###rules , smith was not permitted to attend the game . his twitter feed has been silent since the suspension was announced . he 's a little down , but he 'll rebound from it , woodson said . without smith , woodson used jason###kidd as his first guard off the bench , then filled the open minutes with steve###novak and quentin###richardson , none of whom could remotely replicate smith 's firepower . woodson effectively tightened the rotation to seven players for the second half . the knicks' bench produced just 7 points . we obviously missed j . r . tonight , said tyson###chandler , who had 11 rebounds and kept the knicks in the game with a series of tap outs . we still had our shots , though . the celtics jumped ahead in the opening minutes and took their first double###digit lead of the series in the second quarter while the knicks unraveled behind a series of turnovers and clanked jumpers . pierce had 17 points by halftime , matching his game 3 scoring total , every swish eliciting a powerful roar , as if any one of those shots might be his last here . we have to be confident going back home , anthony said . he added , we look forward to wednesday , i can tell you that .
london chelsea manager jose mourinho 's pursuit of manchester united 's unsettled striker wayne###rooney has added spice to the first big premier###league match of the season when the title###rivals clash at old trafford on monday . the west###london club have already tabled two bids for the england forward and have not ruled out making a third , despite new united boss david###moyes 's steadfast refusal to sell . we have plans b and c , mourinho said ahead of wednesday 's home###game against aston###villa , which they won 2 1 thanks to a second half header from serbian branislav ivanovic . do n't ask me names because it 's difficult to speak about players from other clubs . we have the conditions to try to improve our team by bringing in one more player and we are going to try that till the end . the blues are keen to add to their striking options of fernando###torres , romelu###lukaku and demba###ba but united do not want to sell to a premier###league title###challenger despite the form of robin###van###persie and danny###welbeck , who each scored twice in an opening 4 1 win at swansea###city on saturday . monday 's match between two of the premier###league 's biggest###rivals sees david###moyes in charge of united at home in the league for the first time since replacing alex###ferguson , a man whose absence the returning mourinho said would be strange . it will be difficult for me , and i think all managers , to go to old trafford and play against manchester united without this mythical###figure waiting for us , he recently told sky###sports . the match ( kickoff 1900 gmt ) is part of another busy start to the season for europa###league holders chelsea , who take on european###champions bayern###munich for the super###cup in prague on friday , a repeat of the 2012 champions###league final . it is also the first in a tough run of fixtures for former everton boss moyes' side , who also play liverpool and manchester###city in coming###weeks , and the scot will be desperate to make an early mark in front of his new fans at old trafford . arsenal will look to put their off pitch woes to one side when they make the short trip to fulham on saturday . manager arsene wenger has been under fire for a lack of transfer activity , especially after a shock 3 1 home###defeat by aston###villa on saturday , though he maintains reinforcements will be brought in before the transfer###window shuts on september . one player ruled out of the game is winger alex###oxlade###chamberlain , who injured his knee against villa and could be out for three months or at least six weeks , according to wenger . gutted i 'm injured so early in the season . but i 'm going to be working###hard to hopefully be back playing in 3 months , the player tweeted on tuesday . newcastle united will hope for a significant###improvement on their 4 0 thrashing at manchester###city when they host west###ham united on saturday , a match which sees sam###allardyce return to st###james' park where he briefly managed in . cardiff###city host their first top flight match since 1962 when manchester###city travel to south###wales on sunday ( 1500 ) and are confident danish striker andreas cornelius will make his premier###league debut after missing the 2 0 defeat at west###ham . the welsh side 's chances of gaining their first premier###league points could be slim , however , despite the likely absence of captain vincent###kompany with manuel###pellegrini 's expensively assembled side looking ominous in their opener . having splashed out over 50 million###pounds . 39 million ) to date on new players , tottenham###hotspur will be keen to impress against swansea###city at white###hart###lane on sunday ( 1500 ) after their opening 1 0 victory at crystal###palace .
london hammering down serves , bickering with the umpire and even engaging in cheeky banter with his opponent 's support team , livewire jerzy###janowicz roared into the wimbledon quarter###finals on a momentous day for poland on monday . the 24th seed came through a ferocious duel with grizzled austrian juergen melzer , winning 3 6 7 6 6 4 4 6 6 4 to set up a last eight clash with 130th ranked compatriot lukasz kubot . not since wojtek###fibak reached three consecutive###grand###slam quarter###finals in 1980 has a polish man survived until the last eight and two achieved the feat in a matter of minutes . it 's unbelievable what is going on right now , the 6 feet 8 inch janowicz who rose 200 places up the rankings last year , told###reporters , just as a scoreboard flashed up women 's fourth###seed agnieszka radwanska completing a great day for the poles . we have this moment two players in quarter###final in men 's draw . this is by far the best thing to happen to polish tennis . i went straightaway to ( lukasz 's ) locker###room . we hugged . janowicz , 22 , had barely stopped signing###autographs and throwing his shoes to the court 12 crowd before , over on the even tighter confines of court , kubot clinched a###4 6 6 3 3 6 6 3 6 4 victory over fellow outsider adrian mannarino of france . the 31 year old doubles specialist then launched into his comical celebratory can###can dance routine , known simply as the the kubot as the crowd roared their approval . whoever wins on wednesday will become the first polish man to reach the semi###finals of a grand###slam###singles event . janowicz , who a year ago had to qualify for wimbledon and went on to reach the third round in his maiden slam , is an animated character on court a welcome change to the poker faced demeanour of some players higher up the rankings . melzer can be fiery too and the pair ensured there were plenty of sparks flying on in front of an enthusiastic###crowd on a court that is about as close to muck and nettles as you can get at the all england club . janowicz had problems with his shoes , the net cord sensor and the line judges as well as melzer 's crafty left handed style in the early###stages and smouldered his way through the first two sets , losing the first before cranking up the power to edge the second with an emphatic 7 1 tiebreak . during a tight second set dominated by serve janowicz branded the net cord sensor useless after being made to take one seismic first serve again . he then took exception to melzer 's support team who greeted their man 's winners with loud shout of jawohl sarcastically congratulating the austrian with the same response . later he described the court 12 surface as unplayable after a few tumbles and some quizzical looks during the match . despite the histrionics , janowicz played spectacular tennis , mixing crunching groundstrokes with dabbed drop shots that appear to defy###gravity while all the time softening up opponent 's with a serve that has topped the speed charts at 140mph so far during the tournament . he is prone to losses of concentration , though , as he showed when leading breaking in a testosterone fuelled fourth set , only to hand it back in the next game prompting some eye balling and fist pumping from the wily melzer . when janowicz got the break in the fifth he did not falter and closed out the match before collapsing to the court and kneeling with his head pressed against the grass . he is getting quite a taste for the all england club lawns and with kubot up next , london 's sizeable polish population will be heading to south west###london on wednesday for one of the most unlikely quarter###finals imaginable .
costa do sauipe geoff###hurst was a national###hero when he scored a hat###trick in england 's 1966 final###victory but he did his country no favours when he drew the former champions in one of the toughest 2014 world###cup groups . with three balls already drawn and five to go in the pot containing the remaining european teams , hurst pulled out england for the one vacant###position in group d to set up their hardest campaign for years . roy###hodgson 's side will face south###american champions and twice world###cup winners uruguay , four times winners italy and unpredictable costa###rica at the finals in brazil . to add more spice to the mix england 's opening game will be against italy in manaus in the humidity of the amazon jungle on june . hodgson 's men must also contend with uruguay 's red###hot striker luis suarez , top scorer in the premier###league this season with 13 goals for liverpool . fa chairman greg###dyke was caught by tv cameras on friday making a throat slitting gesture , implying that england had been drawn in a 'group of death' . italy coach cesare###prandelli echoed dyke 's message with his choice of words . it will be very tough indeed for all of us , prandelli told###reporters . it does not matter that we beat england in the euros last year . this is different , everything will be different , the heat will be different , but that is the world###cup . it means that one former world###champion will go out and my job is to make sure it is not italy . hodgson explained earlier this week that the one venue he would rather avoid was manaus , prompting an angry response from mayor arthur virgilio who said the england team would not be welcomed in the city . both backtracked after the draw was made . hodgson said he was happy to play anywhere and that the amazonian venue was not a particular problem as they were facing another european team there . virgilio said his city would be gracious hosts . with uruguay and italy we have almost two top seeds in the group , added hodgson . as the draw progressed i realised there were not too many easy groups but although this one is harder than most at least it is the only one that does not involve a lot of travelling . our other two games against uruguay and costa###rica in sao###paulo and belo###horizonte are not too far from our base in rio de janeiro . one of england 's famous defeats came in belo###horizonte at the 1950 world###cup when they lost 1 0 to the united###states who , like costa###rica , come from the concacaf region . those who believe in omens might think that is a sign hodgson 's team will not progress . england have never beaten uruguay or italy in five attempts competitively . they last faced uruguay in the group###stages of the world###cup in 1966 when former west###ham###united striker hurst helped them win the trophy with his hat###trick in the 4 2 victory over west###germany in the final on home###soil at wembley .
cardiff west###bromwich###albion manager steve###clarke admitted there was no magic formula for success as they slumped to a fourth###straight premier###league defeat with saturday 's 1 0 loss at cardiff###city . the baggies , who sit two points above the relegation###zone , have won only once in their last 10 league matches since beating manchester united at old trafford in late###september . they finished an impressive eighth last season but have struggled to replicate that form , especially without striker romelu###lukaku who scored 17 league goals on loan from chelsea . there is no magic formula , clarke told###reporters . there is no magic###wand . it 's difficult for the players and all we can do is keep trying as hard as we can to break the run as quickly as possible . i do n't think it 's lack of confidence . you can see the team plays with confidence we try and pass the ball . while defeats to manchester###city and liverpool could be excused , failure to beat teams in the lower half of the table such as norwich###city and aston###villa have been costly . you work as hard as you can , you hope you get a lucky###break or you hope that someone does something fantastic , clarke added . one individual moment can change the run of games . the only goal at cardiff on saturday came through peter###whittingham 's second half header , which was enough to put the hosts four points clear of the bottom three . last season 's championship winners hoped to capitalise on their decent home form , which has seen them beat manchester###city and swansea###city this season , and boss malky###mackay was happy to get three points from a side so close to them in the table . it 's another win and it 's against a team that 's round about us in the league as well , the scot said . it 's an important win for us today . it 's a good win for us playing against another proven premier###league team . we deserved to win in my opinion . cardiff 's first league win since early###november moved them up to 14th with 17 points with west###brom two places back on .
the bolshoi###ballet has drawn more notice recently in the united###states for the offstage acid attack on its artistic###director , sergei filin , than for its onstage artistry and virtuosity , but that could change next year when the company plans a series of tour###dates in washington and new york . the themes of betrayal and vengeance will be back onstage , where they belong , when the company returns to washington from may 20 through 25 to dance giselle at the kennedy###center . ( the ballet , with choreography by jean###coralli , jules###perrot and marius###petipa , and staging by yuri grigorovich , tells the tale of a peasant girl , an aristocratic seducer and a bevy of ghosts of jilted maidens bent on revenge . ) the company 's plans for new york###city were less clear . the bolshoi announced this year that it plans to visit new york from july 12 through , to dance swan###lake , don###quixote and spartacus , and to give a concert performance of the tsar 's bride , the opera by rimsky###korsakov . there was speculation that the troupe would perform at lincoln###center , but officials there said it would be premature to comment on the bolshoi 's plans for new york and were less than forthcoming about what the holdup might be . officials at the bolshoi did not immediately respond to calls or an email seeking more information about the tour schedule . at the end of july , though , the bolshoi plans to head to upstate new york to dance don###quixote at the saratoga###performing###arts###center from july 30 through aug . 1 , officials at the center said . the bolshoi 's appearances in washington in may will be the troupe 's first since , when it danced copp###lia there . in a review of that performance , alastair###macaulay of the new york times wrote that its meeting of music , dance and story brings out the sweetness and brio of the bolshoi . since then , the bolshoi has been categorized more by tumult , culminating in the attack , which nearly blinded mr . filin . a bolshoi dancer , pavel dmitrichenko , was charged with orchestrating the attack , which took place in january he pleaded###not###guilty , saying he had arranged for two men to beat mr . filin but did not know that acid would be thrown in his face . the first public hearing in his case began last week , but was then postponed . in the wake of the attack , nikolai tsiskaridze , a popular bolshoi dancer who had clashed with the theater 's leadership , had his contract terminated , and the company 's longtime general director , anatoly iksanov , was ousted . on monday mr . tsiskaridze was appointed the acting director of the vaganova ballet academy in st . petersburg , one of the oldest and most prestigious dance schools in the world .

brussels the european###union 's top economic###policy chiefs , invoking new oversight tools , warned germany , france and 14 other member###countries on wednesday to address problems with their economies . by virtue of their size in the european economy , germany and france have a special responsibility to contribute to the recovery in the rest of the euro###area , said jos###manuel###barroso , president of the european###commission . the verdicts form part of a series of policy recommendations in 11 areas , from employment to public###finances . the goal is to screen all 28 member states for economic risks , known as macroeconomic imbalances , by issuing early warnings under rules that came into force in december . germany 's trade###surplus and france 's public spending were singled out as problem areas . in theory , countries that do not meet their goals could be fined . in practice , the commission has already decided to shy away from full blown confrontations with member states by making the exercise more of an advisory one . this looks like a big procedure , but for no country is there any chance of any concrete enforcement###action at present , said daniel gros , the director of the center for european policy###studies , a research organization in brussels . in one way or another , the commission has put a majority of member###countries into the review , and when you put everyone in the same boat you reduce the scope for identifying standout cases . over all , the european###union has shrunk its average budget###deficit by around half since a peak of almost 7 percent###of###gross###domestic###product in 2009 and has created room for a reduced emphasis on austerity , according to a report issued by the commission . but levels of sovereign and private debt are still too high and member states need to open their product and services markets , the commission said . member states were also told to offer more training to reduce###unemployment , which is likely to remain high in greece and spain through next year and to increase in france . to restore lending and rebuild a stable financial###sector , mr . barroso said , differences of approach between european officials and germany should be overcome to continue building a so called banking union that could help reduce the chances that indebted lenders threaten the stability of national###economies and the euro###area . the commission decided to open a further review into serious problems in spain , noting its high###levels###of###unemployment , and slovenia , for problems such as weak corporate balance###sheets . both countries were already identified by the commission as having excessive imbalances in april . the other countries under examination , though for less serious levels of imbalances , were belgium , bulgaria , croatia , denmark , italy , hungary , luxembourg , malta , the netherlands , finland , sweden and britain . britain was identified as having high private###sector debt , while luxembourg was cited for problems including a loss of export market###share in its important financial###services sector . the commission said it would publish the results of its reviews in the spring , but it did not set a deadline for countries to meet their goals . the commission could recommend financial###penalties of up to one tenth of 1 percent of g.d.p . if countries did not take steps to fix problems . the chance that germany would ever face such a fine is especially low , since european###union finance ministers agreed in 2011 that large and sustained current###account surpluses did not raise the same issues about the stability of the euro###zone that ballooning budget###deficits did and would not lead to sanctions . officials in brussels are also extremely wary of knocking any nascent economic###recovery off course by cracking down too heavily , eroding investor###confidence or , at a time of growing disenchantment with the european project , being seen to usurp national###policy making . the increasing###involvement of the authorities in brussels in national###policy has stirred opposition in some government capitals , in particular in berlin , making the recommendations on wednesday a delicate political exercise . but the bureaucratic thicket of rules and procedures , including the need for the commission to issue a series of further warnings before fines are even considered , allows plenty of scope to avoid serious clashes with national capitals . the in depth review will be done with an open###mind , and there should be no precooked conclusion , olli###rehn , the european###commissioner for economic###and###monetary###affairs , said at a news conference on wednesday , referring to the investigation into germany 's trade###surplus .
paris it is rare that rafa nadal steps off court at the french###open and talks about being made to suffer at the hands of an opponent . yet such was the impact of daniel brands 's free swinging display in their first round###match on monday that the seven times champion was left scratching his head at how the german could be ranked 59th in the world . i do n't know where brands is in the rankings but i can tell you that he ca n't be around 60th . the way he played , i just do n't believe it , nadal told###reporters after moving nervously into the second round with a###4 6 7 6 6 4 6 3 win . he made me suffer , i can tell you , and i 'd like to pay###tribute to what he did . for a brief period on court philippe chatrier , it looked like the german was on the verge of pulling off one of the biggest shocks in the history of grand###slam tennis , leading nadal by a set and 3 0 ahead in a second set###tiebreak . that was when the game turned on its head . brands netted a high risk backhand slice at 3 2 and nadal restored parity by winning five of the next six points . it was just like some oxygen , nadal said about winning the tiebreak . i could finally breathe and it enabled me to think about the rest of the match with less pressure weighing down on me because we were neck and neck . then the match went down a different track and i started###taking over a bit and that 's how i could send back , return his second service . it was nadal 's first grand###slam outing since losing to lukas rosol in the second round of wimbledon last year . there then followed a seven month###absence from the tour as nadal recovered from a troublesome knee problem that has dogged him throughout his career . since his return he has won six of the eight tournaments he has played but he retains a boyish delight in simply being on court after such a lengthy period out . i 'm delighted with the situation as it currently stands , he added . i find myself in a state of affairs that , only a few months back , none of my team could ever have dreamed of . that 's why i 'm tasting every moment . what 's happened is behind me . each passing day is a little less tension and i think i have done more than i could possibly have dreamt about doing only a few months back .

pittsford , n.y . inbee###park of south###korea nearly gave it away sunday , but she held on at the l.p.g.a . championship to earn her fourth###victory and second major title of the season . park , 24 , the world 's top ranked###player , held a three shot lead with five holes to play in regulation but watched that cushion disappear with bogeys on three of the holes after errant shots into the rough . park bogeyed no . 18 to finish at three over par 75 and drop into a tie with catriona###matthew of scotland , who carded a bogey free round of four under . matthew stormed from seven shots back to catch park for a sudden###death showdown at locust hill###country club . park edged matthew with a 20 foot###birdie###putt on 18 on the third extra###hole the two were tied at five under 283 before the playoff . it feels good to win because i hit the ball everywhere and it made the day so much tougher , said park , who became one of six l.p.g.a . players to win the first two majors of a season . i struggled , and it 's almost a miracle that i won . park carded rounds of , 68 , 68 and 75 on a course that had been saturated by nearly five inches of rain , forcing marshals to mark shots into the thick rough with tiny flags . suzann###pettersen of norway blistered the course with a seven under 65 to move into a tie for third with morgan###pressel at four under . pettersen birdied 5 of her last 11 holes and 3 of her last . the south koreans amy###yang , chella###choi , sun young yoo ( 73 ) and jiyai###shin ( 75 ) tied for fifth at three under . for most of the final round , it was a two player race between park and pressel , but pressel , who led the tournament after two rounds , also struggled with errant shots and putts that would not fall . she had three bogeys on the back nine and dropped out of the lead . i 'm definitely disappointed , but it 's the first time in a long time i 've contended , so i 'm happy with the way that i played this week as a whole , said pressel , who has not won since 2008 and has only one top 10 finish this year . normally one of the tour 's most accurate players , park struggled to stay in the fairway in the final round and scrambled more than once to recover from the deep grass . she hit only 6 of 14 fairways and found 8 of 18 greens in regulation sunday . but in the playoff , park hit all three fairways . i just was n't comfortable with my swing in the final round , she said . i do n't know if my swing was bad or my body was tired on the back nine , but i was happy i made the playoff . the stress of locust hill 's unforgiving rough in a major championship was compounded by the fact that park was one of 77 players who played 36 regulation holes sunday in the rain plagued event . thursday 's opening round was pushed back a day because of heavy###rain , so the third round started sunday at 30 a.m. , with only 20 minutes between the conclusion of the third and the start of the final round at noon . i feel like i ran a marathon today , park said . this golf course was playing tough and i 'm happy i got it done . the victory was park 's seventh and her third in a major championship . she also won the 2008 united###states women 's open and this year 's kraft###nabisco###championship . in 11 starts this year , she has won four tournaments , posted two other top 10 finishes and earned more than . 2 million###in###prize###money . and since her 2012 visit to this event , park has jumped from no . 26 to no . 1 in the world###rankings . she 's had an amazing run for the last two years , said matthew , 43 , who had no idea she was in contention until she reached the 18th green . she 's just so consistent and really does n't hit many bad shots . a mother of two , matthew was hoping for a chance to win her fifth l.p.g.a . title and second major . the big tournaments are the ones you want to win , she said . and for park , that chance finally came after 39 holes sunday .
one reason that offshore###wind has not caught on in the united###states is the steep cost of erecting a tower in the water , but researchers at the university of maine tried another approach on friday by launching a floating wind###machine . it is the first offshore###wind installation in united###states waters , according to the energy department , which helped###pay for it . the tower , launched in brewer , me . , sits on three hollow concrete tubes and will be anchored in the gulf of maine . it is a mere 20 kilowatts in capacity , an amount of power that could be soaked up by a handful of big suburban###houses on a hot###summer day . but it is one eighth the dimensions of the one the researchers hope to deploy in the next few years , a gigantic 6 megawatt model , with each blade as long as the wingspan of a boeing . because of its location , it will have two big advantages over machines on land , according to habib j . dagher , a professor of civil###engineering at the university . onshore###wind machines produce most of their energy at night , when it is least valuable to utilities buying the power , but this one will catch the predictable , strong breezes that come up every sunny summer###afternoon , he said , when the sun heats the land more than the sea , creating an onshore breeze . over a year , onshore machines in the eastern###united###states produce only about a third as much electricity as would result if they ran at full tilt every hour of the year , but this one will produce 40 percent to 50 percent as much , he said , because winds offshore are stronger . the engineering , though , is tricky for one thing , the tip of the tower will swing on the waves . but the platform is designed to rock at a slower###rate than the waves to lessen their impact . the project is one of seven sponsored by the energy department under a 168 million program . three are floating , four are fixed , and this is the first to be put into use , according to jose zayas , director of the department 's wind and water power technologies office . the friday project is small but it 's important to recognize it is at a relevant scale , he said . it does represent the behaviors and dynamics of a large machine . among the issues is durability mr . dagher said the concrete would not corrode and should last 60 years , just as the hoover###dam had proven durable over many decades . the offshore###wind resource is equivalent to thousands of hoover dams , he said . the beauty of the floating technology is it does n't care what the water###depths are , mr . dagher said . the platform bears some resemblance to the ones the oil industry uses to drill from . water is shallow off most of the east###coast but not off maine , and not off much of california 's coast , experts say . peter mandelstam , a wind developer and longtime chairman of the american###wind###energy###association 's offshore group , said , we and other developers want this technology developed on both coasts .
pep###guardiola is back on the treadmill . a spaniard who took a year 's sabbatical after winning 14 trophies in four years with barcelona , he is now holding a retreat in the dolomites in northern###italy . his new players speak a different language . but bayern###munich , too , has swept all before it at every level of german and european soccer . it would be arrogant , guardiola said in german , to talk about the start of a new era . i will try to continue with the high###level game that jupp###heynckes achieved . you do n't need to be changing a lot of things in a team that has just won every title . guardiola paused , appearing to marshal in his mind his next words in a language he had studied over the past six months in new york , where he and his family had taken time out from the competitive stresses he has known principally in his native catalonia . i am a bit nervous , he said at his introductory news conference in munich last week . everyone has their opinions about playing###football . bayern have won everything during my time as coach at barcelona , we won everything , so it 's normal there will be interest . interest would be an understatement in any language . it will only be little things we will be changing , guardiola added , really tiny . his news conference was followed by another introducing mario g tze , the playmaker whom munich had just paid . 5 million to buy from borussia###dortmund . again , deference . i 'm sure i can develop here , the 21 year old g tze told###reporters . intriguingly , matthias###sammer , the sport director at bayern , let it slip that g tze 's name , and his consummate adaptability and invention with the ball , had been discussed with guardiola even before the coach agreed to his three year deal . it was very clear early on what kind of player he was after , sammer said . mario 's name came up quickly . guardiola seemed to think it was impossible to get a player like that , sammer said . when we explained that it might be a possibility , he was very excited . the . 5 million release###clause in g tze 's contract with dortmund was easily within munich 's budget . but how g tze will fit in , and how guardiola will juggle the roles of the adaptable thomas m ller , the emerging xherdan###shaqiri and g tze are all part of the mystique of team###building and blending . how much , if at all , will guardiola tamper with the indefatigable work ethic that heynckes persuaded the wings arjen###robben and franck###rib###ry to add to their flair ? how will he change anything on a team that , among other things , utterly###destroyed the side that he built for his former club , barcelona ? everybody is very , very polite to us , guardiola said . and polite , too , was the catalan 's way of sidestepping issues over the personalities and players he has inherited and has yet to strike a rapport with . i take over a team that played exceptionally in the last season , he said . when you are bayern###munich , you always have pressure to play well . it 's one of the world 's biggest###clubs . with that comes pressure , but i accept this challenge without fear . that is why i am the coach . the players , of course , spoke of their new boss in that same polite way . philipp###lahm , the captain , said the first days had been fun . guardiola , he said , is the pleasant kind . lahm added one can talk with him about everything . he has a clear###vision . you can tell the coach is full of energy and has a clear idea of how he wants to play . we are hungry again , and we want to win more titles . saying it and showing it , and somehow putting a new accent upon it , will all come under the microscope as soon as the new season starts in a month . the getting to know one another began with handshakes at the s bener strasse training###base in munich . but it swiftly moved to the comparative serenity of riva###del###garda in northern###italy , where not , 000 but , 500 bavarians clamor to watch training###sessions in temperatures around 86 degrees . the fans will get to see bayern play a friendly against brescia on tuesday . they will probably see players in familiar roles and out to show their new coach and the new assistants he brings that their desire is unimpaired by the summer celebrations , or by the retirement of heynckes . history passes swiftly in soccer . it has to , because borussia###dortmund , the team that munich beat in the bundesliga , and beat , 2 1 , in the champions###league final in may in london , is also regrouping . i was not as depressed as you might have imagined , borussia coach j###rgen###klopp said over the weekend . a win at wembley would have brought other problems . then we would have won all that there is to win it is not so bad that it did not work the first time . klopp has tried to reverse the psychology of winning and losing . his team , which is taught to play closer to the guardiola ethos of movement and control rather than bayern 's more physical approach , has lost g tze but gained a striker , pierre###emerick###aubameyang , from saint###tienne in france and a defender , sokratis###papastathopoulos , from werder###bremen in germany . while klopp wants his team to give fewer###goals , guardiola wants to improve a munich attack that scored 98 goals last season in the bundesliga . i do n't like it when the opposition has the ball , guardiola said . and when we have it , i want to score more goals . subconsciously perhaps , guardiola sounded like the catalan he is . he was expounding on the expressive soccer learned in his childhood at bar a 's academy . converting germans to that style of play might take a little time and persuasion .
vancouver , british###columbia new vancouver###canucks coach john###tortorella was surprised the subject of his famous temper did n't come up in the first question of his introductory news conference on tuesday . but he did n't get angry or yell . the 55 year old boston native admitted his reputation needs some work , and he vowed to improve it as he attempts to give vancouver a long###awaited stanley###cup title . this is the mess i put myself into , and this is the mess i 'm going to get myself out of , he said . the canucks hired the fiery tortorella as the replacement for alain###vigneault , the winningest###coach in franchise###history . known for being abrasive , tortorella is perceived as a bench boss who can lose his temper quickly , sometimes blasts players in public , and has little time for questions from reporters . vigneault , who was hired last week by the new york rangers to replace the fired tortorella , was known more as a cerebral coach who laughed on many occasions and had a rapport with the media . but tortorella , dressed in a dark suit and tie and smiling at times , turned on the charm on tuesday , and even thanked a reporter for her question . i know how important that part of the job is here , tortorella said . when you lose your job , you crawl into a hole a little bit , you reassess yourself , you try to learn . i have certainly gone through that process . have i made mistakes ? absolutely . i make my own bed in this type of situation with the perception of myself in the media . tortorella is also known for battling verbally with players . tortorella , who has 24 years of coaching###experience and won the stanley###cup with the tampa###bay###lightning in , vowed to still be demanding of his players and hold everyone including scoring stars henrik and daniel###sedin accountable . we have a really good leadership group ... but we have not won the stanley###cup , he said . there 's going to be more asked of ( the players , and that starts from the twins right on down . gillis indicated that vigneault 's tenure with the canucks had run its course after seven seasons . vancouver went in the opposite###direction by bringing in tortorella . you have a shelf###life as a coach in the national###hockey###league , gillis said . occasionally , a different voice is necessary . i think john just has a different voice than alain . alain is a very good hockey coach . john is a very good hockey coach . but they approach it from different places and they approach it in different ways , and i felt it was necessary to make a change . gillis said the team 's ownership###group was involved in the interviewing process , but he dismissed the idea that the aquilini family chose the new coach . at the end of the day , we were both unanimous in our selection , he said . tortorella was fired by the rangers after they lost to the boston###bruins in the second round of the playoffs in five games . as coach of the rangers the past five seasons , tortorella led new york to the playoffs three times . tortorella has reached the playoffs eight times and won the jack###adams###award as nhl coach of the year in . he was let go four days after the rangers' season ended against the eastern###conference###champion bruins . tortorella was an assistant with the rangers in the 1999 2000 season and took over for john###muckler as coach for the final four games . tortorella later spent seven seasons as coach of the lightning before returning to the rangers in february 2009 after head###coach tom###renney was fired . vigneault was let go after the canucks were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the second straight year . he guided the canucks to a berth in the stanley###cup###final in 2011 and helped the team win two presidents' trophies and six northwest division titles . tortorella , the career leader in wins by a u.s . born coach with , served as an assistant for the american team that won###silver at the 2010 vancouver olympics . he also handled head###coaching duties for team###usa at the 2008 world###championship and served as an assistant###coach at the event in . he said he is looking forward to coaching a canadian team for the first time . to be involved with this , i could n't be more excited , he said . it 's always something i thought about and wanted the opportunity . regardless of the location , tortorella just wants to win . everybody says be a good loser , he said . i think if you 're a good loser , you are a loser .

( reuters ) coach gerardo###martino has become the target of european clubs while steering newell 's old boys to the argentine###league title they will celebrate at home in rosario on sunday . newell 's , who host argentinos###juniors at the marcelo###bielsa stadium on the last day of the season , secured the final championship crown with a match to spare . martino could join the club of former newell 's players like bielsa and mauricio###pochettino , now at southampton in england 's premier###league , to have tasted big coaching###jobs in europe . however , a stumbling###block could be that he has told both real###sociedad and malaga he will not be available until newell 's are no longer involved in the libertadores###cup having led them to next month 's semi###finals . media reports say this has not prevented real###madrid , though , from also looking at the 50 year old argentine as an alternative should their hopes of signing italian carlo###ancelotti fall through . martino , who made his name internationally steering paraguay to the last eight at the world###cup for the first time in , was at the heart of newell 's remarkable sixth first division title . he turned down a huge offer from colombia after quitting the paraguay job in 2011 to return to the club where he played 509 matches as a midfielder to help steer them clear of relegation . in 18 months in charge martino , who has a stand named after him at the marcelo###bielsa ground , has done much more than that . his success stands###in###stark###contrast to the failure of big buenos###aires side independiente , who changed coach three times in the same time span in their failed###bid to avoid###relegation for the first time last weekend . relegation in argentina is determined by a separate table of teams' average points over three seasons . a single poor###season does not necessarily lead to relegation but two or three can . martino , nicknamed tata ( grandad , has criticised the league###format with two 19 match championships per season , named inicial and final in , for the generally###poor standard of football . in 19 match tournaments a team without a very good overall performance can become champions . i adhere to the 38 match###format because there is less discussion over ( the merits of ) the champions , he said . newell 's were the best team of the season , having finished second to velez sarsfield in the inicial before winning the final . there is a strong sense of belonging among players who began their careers at newell 's , reflected also in the return from europe of argentina world###cup players gabriel###heinze and maxi rodriguez and top scorer ignacio###scocco to form the backbone of martino 's side . it 's a dream , we came to try to get ( the team ) out of a bad###situation and today we 're the best in argentina , said rodriguez . record 33 times champions river###plate , whose form has been irregular as they rebuild after promotion a year ago , vied with newell 's for the title until a crushing 5 1 defeat at lanus last weekend . they will , however , also have a say over the remaining third relegation###place after union and independiente when they host san###martin , who need only a draw to survive at argentinos' expense .

houston signaling a possible break with 40 years of energy###policy , energy secretary ernest###moniz has suggested that it may be time for the obama administration to reconsider the nation 's ban on exporting domestically###produced crude###oil . congress made most oil###exports without a license illegal in the 1970s to conserve supplies at a time when opec oil embargoes produced long lines at gas stations and threatened the american economy . but over the last five years a frenzy of oil###drilling in shale rock###formations in texas and north###dakota have produced a glut of crude in the midwest and gulf of mexico states . those restrictions on exports were born , as was the department of energy and the strategic petroleum reserve , on oil disruptions , mr . moniz said in remarks to reporters at the platts global energy outlook forum in new york on thursday . there are lots of issues in the energy space that deserve some new analysis and examination in the context of what is now an energy world that is no longer like the 1970s . the energy department does not have the power to relax restrictions on exports but mr . moniz said the it would be willing to produce technical###analysis on the issue for the commerce###department which issues the export licenses . oil###companies are lobbying to allow exports , arguing that the united###states could substantially###increase export###earnings from selling high quality crudes abroad . that type of crude###oil is not always easily refined by american refineries that were outfitted for processing lower quality crudes imported from mexico , venezuela and the middle###east . the lobbyists argue that such exports could lower global oil###prices , which would bring relief for american consumers . but others , including influential members of congress , say that oil###exports would actually raise domestic###gas prices and threaten domestic oil supplies during times of crisis in the middle###east or in africa . mr . moniz 's remarks were welcomed by oil company###executives as a sign that the administration may be moving in their direction on exports . if the department of energy and others push on commerce , then maybe they can get it over the hump , said chip johnson , president and chief###executive of carrizo oil and gas , a midsize texas based oil company active in the shale###oil fields . i think we should keep national###security first , but we should export oil just like anything else . oil###companies are already beginning to export more oil to canada since those export licenses are relatively easy to obtain . canada is the largest###exporter of oil to the united###states , but since many grades of american oil are selling at a discount to global benchmarks , eastern canadian refiners are buying american crude to process into diesel and gasoline . over the first 10 months of the year , the united###states exported an average of , 000 barrels of crude###oil a day , mostly to canada , according to the energy department . over the same period in , the united###states exported an average of , 000 barrels a day and , 000 barrels a day in , when american oil###production began its expansion . some analysts predict that exports to canada will soon approach , 000 barrels a day . but some democratic###lawmakers are already voicing concerns about exports . senator edward j . markey , democratic of massachusetts , said in a statement this week , the growing chorus from the oil industry to change longstanding u.s . law to permit the export of american crude###oil is a disturbing trend . he added , this oil should be kept here in america , to benefit our consumers and to reduce our dependence on imports from the middle###east .
richard dare made a splash last year as an outspoken entrepreneur turned arts administrator and started work on jan . 2 as the president and chief###executive of the new jersey symphony , with the promise that his business###acumen would bring it new luster . on friday , nine days later , he resigned , citing a 1996 case in which he was charged with an attempted lewd act upon a 15 year old girl , whom he later married . in a statement , mr . dare , 48 , said he believed that media attention to my family 's personal###life will harm the organization and musicians i cherish , as well as needlessly embarrass my wife . stephen sichak , the orchestra 's co chairman , said it knew about the charge when mr . dare was hired but that inquiries into the case from friends of the symphony , not reporters , began coming in . concerns about the public perception of this subject###matter emerged , mr . sichak said . the situation has become a distraction and is keeping us from being able to do what we do best , making###music , so the board accepted mr . dare 's resignation . the development came as a new york times investigation into mr . dare 's background raised###questions about aspects of his r sum and business accomplishments . former associates have suggested that he exaggerated the extent of his business###dealings , and evidence to support some of his claims like his having testified frequently before congress could not immediately be found . mr . dare declined to answer###questions during a conference call with new jersey symphony officials but said that he would consider e mailed queries . he did not respond to an e mail sent late friday###afternoon , although his lawyer , daniel n . arshack , responded in the evening to several questions about his client 's background . mr . dare pleaded no contest and was sentenced to 60 days in jail in the criminal###case . he was placed on probation for three years and was registered as a sex###offender in california , where the incident occurred , according to court documents . in his statement mr . dare called his actions attempted misbehavior , said the charges were completely dismissed , and the case was set aside . the court documents show that the case was dismissed in 1999 and his probation cut###short by a year . according to reports at the time in the press###enterprise of riverside , calif . , mr . dare had been a fifth grade teacher at loma###linda academy before opening an alternative###school in 1992 called brightwater academy . the victim now his wife had been a student there . her mother came home one day to find mr . dare naked in the house with her daughter and called the police . mr . dare then lived in grand terrace , in san###bernardino###county , east of los###angeles . the prosecutor , arthur harrison , said in a telephone interview that the girl did not cooperate with police . as soon as she turned , he up and married her , said mr . harrison , now a state judge . it was clearly a willing victim , but clearly under age as well . mr . dare said he had told new jersey symphony officials early on about his encounter with the law . mr . sichak , the co chairman , confirmed that and said a thorough background###check was completed . orchestra officials reviewed court documents . we were satisfied with what we saw , he added . he declined to disclose mr . dare 's salary , but the previous chief###executive earned about , 000 a year . mr . sichak said reference calls were also made to former business associates . we attempted to understand his capabilities , his management style , what he was good at , what areas he could improve in , mr . sichak said . we did not assess nor , frankly , base our decision on business results and the accuracy thereof . mr . dare described his career this way in a television interview on njtv i spent most of my career the last say , 15 , almost 20 years building large###companies . his major business venture was as founder of pacific###rim partners inc . , which acted as a go between between japanese and american businesses . it was founded in 2008 and ceased most operations after the march 2011 earthquake in japan .
the mets had promised 2014 would be their year . they had the pitching . they had david###wright . they had matt###harvey . they said they would spend###money . it would all come together next year , they hoped , and they would be contenders again , at last . those already shaky plans seemed to be dashed friday when the mets announced harvey , their ace , would have tommy###john###surgery , which means that in all likelihood , he will miss the 2014 season . dr . james###andrews , the noted orthopedic###surgeon , will perform the operation this month . on a conference call with reporters , general###manager sandy###alderson indicated that harvey 's recovery would take 15 months , and mentioned a return date of feb . 1 , 2015 . harvey 's decision came two and a half weeks after he said he would try to rehabilitate his right elbow , which has a partly torn###ligament , and forgo surgery . the risk had been that he could completely tear the ligament and miss the 2015 season , too . harvey made his initial###decision after consulting with andrews . he had not seen another doctor since then , had not started throwing and had not experienced pain . alderson said that harvey had thought it over and had come to a new conclusion on his own . i 'm an optimist , alderson said . i 'm assuming that matt will fall within the 85 to 90 percent who have this surgery successfully . then there 's always the possibility that things will not work out . but , alderson continued everyone believes , including the doctors , that he 's an excellent candidate for successful###surgery . he 's young . he 's strong . his elbow was stable in spite of the injury , which i think is a testimony to the strength that he has in his forearm and upper###arm . and his mechanics are pretty clean . harvey had , at times , appeared to be the best pitcher in baseball this season . he posted a . 27 earned###run###average and started the all star game for the national###league at citi###field . but in late august , after allowing 13 hits to the detroit###tigers , he reported he had discomfort in his forearm . when a tear was found , harvey said he would do everything he could to avoid surgery . when he saw andrews for a second opinion , andrews deemed the elbow stable . the mets held a news conference announcing there was still hope of avoiding surgery . for the time being , harvey would undergo a six to eight week throwing program to test the elbow . for me , harvey said then , i believe if i can rehab , i 'd rather bet on myself doing the work to stay out of getting surgery than having to get surgery . it was , alderson said friday , an emotional###response . about two and a half weeks later , harvey changed his mind . so , going into the 2014 season , the mets' rotation consists of zack wheeler , jon###niese , dillon###gee and two open###spots . alderson is unlikely to pursue a high###end starter . instead , he could try to add a reliable veteran , like the reds' bronson###arroyo . daisuke###matsuzaka pitched well in his last four starts for the mets , and could receive some consideration . the mets have several highly###regarded prospects including jacob###degrom , rafael montero and noah syndergaard but they would probably follow the same path to the rotation as wheeler , who joined the mets in mid###june and established himself over 17 starts . although many pitchers have rebounded from tommy###john###surgery , there is no guarantee harvey will return to form . the washington###nationals' stephen###strasburg is the most prominent pitcher to have the surgery in recent###years . after electrifying baseball in his first season in , the hard throwing strasburg had the surgery and came back late in the 2011 season . in the last two seasons , he has posted a . 08 e.r.a . the mets appeared relieved that harvey will have the surgery . based on the conversations that i had had with both of the doctors , i felt this would be the right decision , alderson said . in that sense , i 'm happy that matt has reached the same conclusion .

for the 2001 comedy monsters , inc . pixar###animation###studios devised all manner of squishy , creepy , cuddly , fuzzy , wobbly creatures to populate that tale of monsters who harness the energy of human screams to power their city . now , the film 's prequel , monsters###university , opening june , takes its familiar lead characters the short , green , one eyed mike and his tall , furry sidekick , sully , back to school . several new colorful###characters attend the college , but one of the most curious is art , a purple longhaired hippie esque monster majoring in new age philosophy . he 's one of the misfits of oozma kappa ( we 're o.k. ! ) , a fraternity mike and sully join . with his wide , rainbow shaped stance , he 's the kind of student who keeps a dream journal and is excited to laugh with you and cry with you . from his shape , to his no worries personality , to the way he moves ( and scares , art proved to be a design challenge . the filmmakers were trying to base characters on college types , like jocks , cool###kids and nerds . but , the film 's director , dan scanlon , said by phone from pixar 's headquarters in emeryville , calif . we did n't know what art was . he was this mystery . and in a weird , kind of wonderful way , that became who art was . we realized that that itself is a college type . here is a look at the visual evolution of art , as explained by mr . scanlon , the sketch artist chris sasaki and the production###designer ricky nierva . mr . scanlon initially###proposed making art a theater major . so mr . sasaki began with drawings like this sketch , in which he looks more alligator like and sports a scarf . we were playing around with this longer shaped , chest out character , where he 's more theatrical and over the top , mr . sasaki said . but the story went in a different direction and art became more mysterious . with the design , i went through a lot of frustration because i did n't know where to take it , he said . i remember as a joke i drew this letter a and put two dots for eyes in the middle . i thought , hey that 's kind of funny . maybe he 's just all legs . this sketch shows an early version of that shape . i thought , with these legs he could do some really funny walks and would be funny for the audience to see . these pencil###sketches by mr . scanlon were an attempt to better flesh out art 's movement , which became more versatile , and his purpose . they helped the creative###team visualize some possibilities . in one scene , he wraps himself in a circle and rolls like a tire . in another , he stretches himself out into a long line so he can roll under a bed . a big part of my job is to go to a guy like chris or ricky and explain who the character is and their purpose in the story , mr . scanlon said . i 'm the guy who knows the most about what the story needs . we have great###artists who can design appealing characters . i let them know what they need to create and inspire them to create it . when the oozma kappa members are under threat of arrest , art screams out , i ca n't go back to jail ! one liners like that abound , further complicating this character and what the audience does or does n't know about him . this rough sketch , which mr . nierva drew by marker , was an early pass at trying to capture art 's wacky but elusive nature . i thought that he would be shedding all the time , mr . nierva said , but added we went away from it because you do n't want him leaving this trail of hair everywhere . it 's technically a challenge . he said the technical###department got a little nervous when that drawing came up . also , i was playing around with the hair tuft on his head , really pushing that even further . this painting , by the art###director dice tsutsumi , is what the designers call a color rough . it is a pass at the final look of the character after it is fully sculptured in clay as a maquette . here , you would explore color and fur , mr . nierva said . it was mr . tsutsumi 's idea to make art purple , while the stripes came from mr . sasaki . i remember wanting to do the striping to kind of feel like tube socks in a way , mr . sasaki said . so i incorporated that into his fur pattern . one feature that remained throughout the evolution of the design was art 's giant mouth , which takes up much of his face . the team did n't want the teeth to be sharp . we wanted them to feel a little less threatening and kind of inviting , mr . sasaki said , explaining the rounded look they went with . and we wanted to make them kind of offset , so he does n't have that divide of where the center teeth would be . in the movie , art is heavy on fur , especially at the feet , with small mangled speckles of different colors in that fur . his stance , movement and arms had three inspirations . one was the whimsical performance###troupe mummenschanz . i showed dan some youtube###videos and there was this particular performance with a person inside of a gigantic coiled tube , mr . nierva said . the tube was a character playing with a big ball . another was the muppets . like those characters , pixar wanted to make art and the other monsters appealing , approachable and not too scary . the third was a saturday###night###live sketch , featuring chris farleyas the motivational###speaker matt###foley who lives in a van down by the river . it 's the way that chris###farley stood , mr . nierva said . he would spread his legs wide and put his arms between his legs as he 's making his point . and we loved how that look felt .
paris never a stranger to the big stage , david###beckham was finally overwhelmed and reduced to tears as he went out in a burst of fireworks and cheers saturday in his final###home###game for paris###saint###germain before retirement . fans chanted his name before the game , and they chanted some more when he was finished . there was an outpouring of hugs , cheers , song and congratulations from teammates , opponents and even former president nicolas###sarkozy . to end my career in front of a crowd like that , with players like that , it 's very special , beckham said , adding that emotions had already started overpowering him before he was taken off . it started about 20 minutes before that , to be honest . i started thinking and then , you know , i could n't concentrate by then , and it was difficult , he said . you know , you try to hold the emotion back because it is what it is , but it 's difficult . there also was some soccer to be played . and beckham , appointed###captain for the game , was involved in two of his team 's goals in a 3 1 victory over brest . he drew a roaring standing###ovation and wiped away tears when he left in the 81 st minute . as the match drew to a close , beckham appeared to tire , putting his hands on his thighs as he leaned forward . i want to say thank you to everybody in paris . to my teammates , to the staff , to the fans , beckham told the fans after the game . it 's been very special to finish my career here . it could not have been any more special . one after another , the players then walked out onto a makeshift podium in the middle of the field and thanked the crowd after the game had ended . when it was beckham 's turn to climb onto the podium , the beatles song 'hello , goodbye' rang out as the stadium 's big###screen beamed pictures of beckham 's short psg career and flashed another message of thanks . draped in the english flag , beckham sprinted onto the stage . merci , paris , he said . i 'm very sad to be leaving , but thank you . he will miss the world of football because he showed a good image every time , really professional , ancelotti said . i think that he is sure that this decision was the right moment and we have to respect this . it was a fantastic evening for him . he will have a very good memory of this night . when beckham had gone off , the crowd , which included sarkozy , rose as one and players trotted over to give him a hug . the players from brest also understood the moment . charlison benschop , who had scored brest 's consolation###goal a minute earlier , walked over to shake his hand . with chants of dav eed beckham , dav eed beckham echoing , beckham looked to be on the verge of tears . he applauded the crowd and blew a kiss to his family in the stands . there was time for one more hug this one a bit longer from coach carlo###ancelotti before he sat on the bench , maybe for the last time . i spoke with david and told him that in my last ( ever ) game i scored###two###goals , ancelotti joked . i said to him 'maybe tonight you 'll score two goals' but maybe he did n't have my quality . the former england captain announced thursday he is retiring at the end of the season . ancelotti added that it is unlikely beckham will play in the final###game of the season , away to lorient on may , but that this has not been decided yet . i just feel that it 's the right time . i feel that i 've achieved everything that i could in my career . i wanted to go out as a champion , beckham said . i 've finished my career in a team that has treated me like i 've been here for 10 years . beckham has yet to say if he will play in psg 's last game , at lorient on may . it 's a historic###moment , the stadium announcer intoned as beckham was substituted . not that the crowd of , 983 needed a reminder . as beckham walked off slowly , applauding the fans , his hair uncharacteristically bedraggled , his mother , sandra , wiped away a tear in the stands . his replacement , ezequiel###lavezzi , gave beckham a big hug and then ruffled the fashion maven 's hair . beckham immediately swept it back into place . after the final whistle , teammates hoisted beckham off the ground and repeatedly tossed him in the air , putting a smile back on his face . the celebrations kicked in as the lights were turned off , light sticks were held up and the crowd broke into song . the fireworks then flew into the night###sky , accompanied by an 'ole ! ' as each one went off . after 22 years of playing###football i 'm going to take a few months to enjoy time with my family , beckham said , before adding that he still wants to stay involved with psg . it 's been a very special place for me . before the game , the 38 year old englishman was given a rousing reception at parc###des###princes . spectators broke into chants of merci , david when his name was read over the stadium speaker . psg 's players walked onto the field to a thunderous reception , with nirvana 's smells###like###teen###spirit reverberating . psg right back christophe jallet dyed his hair in the blue , white and red of the french flag while the players all wore next season 's team jerseys . the game brought a stronger security presence , with about 150 riot###police forming a ring inside the stadium in the second half . the show of force followed monday###night 's riots at trocadero plaza , where a celebration to mark the french title turned###violent . this was beckham 's 14th game and fifth start since joining psg in a surprise move on the last day of the transfer###window . he was appointed###captain before the game . psg clinched the league###title last weekend , making beckham the first english player to win the championship in four countries after title success with manchester united , real###madrid and the los###angeles###galaxy . beckham was involved in the opening###goal in the seventh minute . his free###kick found clement chantome , whose pass released zlatan ibrahimovic as he broke into the penalty###area down the right side . ibrahimovic struck the ball into the opposite corner . ibrahimovic almost scored a minute later when beckham 's superb long pass sent him through , but the imposing swede hesitated between heading the ball over goalkeeper alexis thebaux or taking it past him . theabaux snatched the ball from him . beckham set up the second goal in the 32nd with a corner###kick from the left . blaise###matuidi 's poorly hit ball bounced into the ground and looped over thebaux 's outstretched arm . ibrahimovic blasted in a free###kick from 30 yards into the top left###corner for the third goal , setting a personal###record with his 29th league###goal of the season . early in the second half , beckham almost set up striker kevin gameiro with a curling cross from the right that the striker headed wide . it would not be long before beckham was gone , but the noise and the celebration and the fireworks still had a ways to go .
london during this gray november , three extraordinary athletes have demonstrated that 40 is just an age and not necessarily an end to performing well in sports . sachin###tendulkar passed that milestone in april . he chose his own time and place to play his final test###innings , on his home###ground in mumbai . he signed off by scoring a half###century more elegant than most men could ever emulate , and before he retired to the pavilion , a boy in the crowd held up a card that said only humans will now play cricket . tendulkar 's greatest###gift was the act of timing . his second greatest was a childlike ability to sustain enthusiasm for his game , year after year . in soccer , we have not one , but two 40 year olds still active at the highest###level . this month , we saluted javier###zanetti , the argentine defender who came back from a###torn###achilles###tendon . zanetti never countenanced that he would play again for inter###milan , and he does not believe that the minutes he enjoyed as a substitute at livorno on nov . 9 will be his last in the shirt . zanetti has put in the hard miles in training to make himself available at any time when the coach calls on his experience . tendulkar has left . zanetti refuses to go . and ryan###giggs can scarcely believe that anyone is even asking him to set a date for his retirement . giggs turns 40 on friday , when he will report an hour or more before his manchester united colleagues do because the welshman now has extra responsibilities . he is a player and a trainee coach , a member of the think tank planning the next match . but his priority , still , is to push his body as far as it can go . there are no plans to celebrate the big . the giggs family got that out of the way weeks###ago . friday is a working day , and he wants to play a part in sunday 's premier###league contest at tottenham###hotspur . the manager , david###moyes , is the new boy around united . moyes replaced alex###ferguson , who had signed giggs as a schoolboy , and moyes asked giggs to lend his unparalleled experience he has won the english###league 13 times to the coaching###staff . one thinks of the words of the roman poet virgil . experto credite , virgil wrote . trust one who has done it . the player said , yes , boss . but he begged to be allowed to fight for his place in the team at the same time . he 's a specimen , moyes told###reporters . ryan is incredibly fit . seeing him at close###quarters , you marvel every day . you can imagine how good he must have been in his prime . his prime ? giggs has n't yet conceded that he is so far beyond that . i 'm still enjoying training , giggs told gary###neville , his former manchester united colleague , on tv last week . neville , 15 months younger than giggs , retired a year ago to work for sky television . when pushed about whether the mind or the body are becoming tired , giggs sparred with his old pal . now i 'm a coach as well as a player , giggs said , i think you 've got to put our inconsistent start down to the players . he laughed , and spoke about staff and players winning or losing together . and no , he did not yet feel his time was up . he will sign a contract to play at least one more year if he feels as he does today . it is fashionable to discard experience in life , never mind in sports . giggs was united 's first team left winger at , and the team now has adnan###januzaj , 18 , and wilfried###zaha , 21 , challenging to play on the wings where ashley###young , nani and antonio###valencia are all established international###performers . giggs , however , is more versatile than them all . if he has lost a yard of acceleration , and maybe his breathtaking change of pace with the ball in his stride , he has gained craftiness . he knows how to work through central###midfield to make the passes , to guide other players , to channel his experience garnered through , 020 senior games for united or for wales . of course you have doubts , he conceded to neville . you can have bad games at , or at , but you work harder to get over them . hard work , high ambition , an unrelenting thirst to play and an addiction to winning . when you see giggs glide with unimpaired balance and hear his determination not to give up until someone else makes him , you understand why moyes marvels at him . there is precedence in the english game . stanley###matthews , the wizard of the dribble who played top class soccer until he was , regretted having retired too early , just because of a number . matthews played from 1932 to , a different era in a game played at a different tempo . but , like giggs , he was a naturally gifted and slender athlete , fanatically dedicated to maintaining his fitness . and both were blessed not to suffer serious injuries . they learned that the first yard of soccer is in the head . and that if you can see the moves before anyone else , you are halfway there . last sunday , united played for the first time in giggs 's lifetime in cardiff . it is the city of his birth , though the family moved to the manchester area when ryan was 7 while his father played###rugby###league for swinton . the toughness of rugby , which giggs also tasted in his school days , prepared him for the batterings he encountered against soccer 's hard men later on . being the elder###statesman , and player###coach , does not stop the united players from being cheeky about his age . where 's your walking###stick ? they joked sunday . some stick . he craved some action at cardiff . his mother , grandparents , uncles###and###aunts were in the stands , their cheers drowned out by the booing of home###team fans the moment giggs went on as a substitute with 20 minutes to play . in those minutes , he produced two incisive passes that were beyond the imagination of the younger manchester players in a hard fought match .
virginia###water luke donald , the pga###championship winner in 2011 and , missed the cut after returning a###level par 72 for a six over total of 150 at wentworth on friday . the real###damage was done in thursday 's opening round when the world number six collapsed to a six over 78 in cold , damp conditions at the european###tour 's flagship event . the weather was no better for the second round and donald suffered an early blow when he took a double###bogey five at the second . the briton also dropped a stroke at the third before he staged a mini revival with birdies at the fourth , eighth , 12th and 13th . another bogey followed at the 17th before he ended his round with a birdie four . donald said the eight degree temperatures and the 15 mph###winds were a factor in his performance but also acknowledged that he had played###poorly . it 's quite chilly , he told###reporters as he sheltered from the driving###rain under an umbrella . even for england this is pretty unseasonal and it made the course play tougher . the last couple of years it 's been pretty warm for this event and the ball traveled a lot . this year i 've been hitting longer irons into some of these holes because of the weather . the bottom line , though , is i did n't###play very well . i was nine over for the first 21 holes and that is pretty terrible golf really . the 35 year old donald said he struggled with every department of his game . when i missed fairways , i missed the green and then i was n't getting up and down , he explained . my problems were just kind of compounding . not one part of my game is really firing at the moment , added the former world number one . donald will attempt to take heart from the five birdies he notched on friday . it 's not like i am a million###miles away , he said . it 's about doing the things luke###donald usually does well being tidy around the greens and making the putts when i need to . i 've got to start there and work my way back . sometimes it 's just a little something small from my coach that will get me back on track . i 'm not too worried . it 's never nice to miss the cut here , a place i 've###played well , but failure is a much bigger motivation for me than successes . donald 's playing partners , spanish pair sergio garcia and gonzalo fernandez castano , fared a lot better than the englishman . garcia , embroiled in a racism row with world number one tiger###woods this week , carded a 71 for a one under total of . fernandez castano is also on 143 after going round in . the cut for the final two rounds fell at two over .
robin###thicke 's song blurred###lines is one of the year 's biggest###hits , but behind the scenes the song is the focus of a bitter dispute that led wednesday to the family of marvin###gaye filing a copyright lawsuit . in august , mr . thicke and his two fellow songwriters , pharrell###williams and clifford harris jr . ( also known as the rapper t.i . ) , sued the family of marvin###gaye in a pre###emptive###strike , saying that they expected gaye 's children to claim that blurred###lines copied gaye 's 1977 hit got to give it up . the similarities between the songs among them a smooth , retro beat and lots of falsetto have been noted by critics and mr . thicke has acknowledged got to give it up as an inspiration . but being reminiscent of a 'sound' is not copyright###infringement , the men said in their suit . two of gaye 's children , frankie and nona , have responded with a countersuit , filed in united###states###district###court in los###angeles . the suit says that not only does blurred###lines infringe on their father 's copyright , but that another of mr . thicke 's songs , love after war , also copies a gaye song , after the dance . according to the suit , which was first reported by the hollywood###reporter , a musicologist , judith finell , studied blurred###lines and got to give it up and found a constellation of at least eight distinctive and important compositional elements between them . extending their case beyond copyright , the gayes also sued sony###atv###music###publishing , which controls the emi publishing catalog , which includes gaye 's songs . the gayes accuse sony###atv which is also a publisher of mr . williams 's work of breach###of###contract and of fiduciary###duty by taking###sides against the family in the dispute and trying to intimidate them into dropping the case . gaye died in . according to the gayes , sony###atv tried to persuade them that their case was frivolous , and that the company 's chairman who was not named in the suit , but is martin n . bandier , a well known music###executive told the family they were killing the goose that laid the golden egg by pursuing the case . in a statement , sony###atv said that another musicologist had determined that blurred###lines did not infringe on got to give it up , and also defended its corporate role as a steward for songwriters . we take our role in protecting the works of all of our songwriters from infringement very seriously , the company said . and while we very much treasure the works of marvin###gaye and our relationship with the gaye family , we regret that they have been ill advised in this matter .

los###angeles the los###angeles###kings know all about the creeping inevitability that sets in when a team gets behind 0 3 in a playoff###series . after all , that 's where they put every opponent they faced on the way to the stanley###cup title last year . with more big points from their siberian defenseman and even more big saves from their champion goalie , los###angeles stayed safely out of that hole in the western###conference###finals . slava voynov had a goal and an assist , jonathan###quick made 19 saves , and los###angeles beat chicago 3 1 in game 3 tuesday###night , trimming the blackhawks' series lead to . this is kind of what i expected this to be when we did it last year , captain dustin###brown said . last year , we were playing at a###level few teams ever play at . this year , it 's taking that extra effort out of us , and we 're coming up with it . justin###williams also scored and dwight king added an empty net goal in the defending nhl champions' 15th consecutive###home victory since march . the kings never trailed while ending the top seeded blackhawks' five game postseason winning###streak , but they had to survive a tense third period with quick 's brilliance and a strong###defensive effort , avoiding that nearly insurmountable three game deficit . it 's not something we wanted to try and test out , so it was certainly a must win in our situation , kings defenseman rob###scuderi said . we were just able to be aggressive instead of sitting back and letting them dictate the pace this time . that 's what we have to do to compete with those guys . jeff###carter had two assists in an inspired effort , despite the absence of injured linemate mike###richards , and voynov had his fourth multipoint game in a prolific postseason . every time the blackhawks mounted their speedy attack , the kings survived with solid###defense and fortunate bounces a combination they 've been getting all spring at staples###center . although they ca n't###explain it , the kings have won all eight of their home playoff###games nine straight dating to last season 's title clincher . after their 16 4 roll through last season 's playoffs , not much has been easy this year for the kings , who have n't scored more than two goals without an empty netter in their last eight games . we have a certain way we need to play , kings defenseman robyn regehr said . for whatever reason , we do a heck of a good job of it at home , and not as good on the road . bryan bickell scored and corey###crawford stopped 25 shots for the blackhawks , who chased quick from game 2 and earned back to back home victories to open the series last weekend . the kings had lost five of their previous seven playoff###games before getting back to friendly staples###center and their sellout###crowd . quick also returned to conn###smythe###trophy form in game , highlighted by a dazzling late save on bickell , while his low scoring teammates generated just enough offense to hold off the blackhawks , who had n't lost since game 4 of the second round . they play a lot better at home , crawford said . they were buzzing . they were running around a little bit more than in chicago , but we were ready for that . we knew they would come harder . we were almost there . we almost tied it . the blackhawks matched their playoff low with just 20 shots , but the presidents' trophy###winners were one good bounce away from tying the score in the final###minutes . brandon###saad nearly had an open net after a cross ice pass from viktor stalberg with 5 minutes left , but could n't collect the puck . moments later , keith missed a near breakaway at the kings' blue line when chicago went offside and quick set off a frenzy in the crowd when he stopped bickell 's fine chance late . we knew exactly what kind of game they were going to play , and that they would have more confidence and more energy in their own building , saad said . we just did n't###bring that same effort and same pace . there were a lot of little thing we could do better , but that comes with our preparation and being ready to play at the highest###level . we know we 've got to be better than that . the kings played their second straight game without richards , their leading postseason scorer heading into game . the veteran center has an apparent concussion after a big###hit from dave###bolland in the series opener . richards' absence opened a lineup spot for promising rookie tyler toffoli , who has three points in the last two games . the 21 year old ahl rookie of the year got the primary assist on voynov 's goal . after the kings scored just 11 goals in their previous seven games , coach darryl###sutter shook up his lines . slumping center anze kopitar was moved back to the third line , while jarret###stoll moved up to the kings' nominal top line between williams and brown . between the line changes and the desperation necessary in such a situation , the kings came out with a noticeable edge and improved passing . they took the lead just 21 in on a strong sequence started and finished by williams , who forced nick###leddy 's turnover before scoring on a pass from voynov . the two time stanley###cup winner has six goals in the playoffs four in the past six games after scoring just 11 in the 48 game regular###season . los###angeles kept up the pressure in the second period , with carter and toffoli generating sustained###pressure before voynov beat crawford , who was screened . voynov 's shot was doubly hard to stop because he broke his stick on the swing , turning it into a changeup . the kings got a four minute power play moments later when defenseman duncan###keith high sticked carter in the face , punctuating a bad###tempered game by opening a gash on carter 's mouth . sutter thought keith deserved a match penalty for the nasty play , calling it retaliation . but los###angeles managed just one shot on that scoreless power play , and bickell got the blackhawks back in it with his seventh goal of the postseason in the final###minute of the second period . bickell was left###untouched behind the net after kings defensemen drew###doughty and robyn###regehr both lost their footing , and the pending free###agent skated in front alone to beat quick with just chicago 's third shot of the period . but the blackhawks could n't get another past quick , who had dominated the first two rounds with the same style that made him the kings' playoff###mvp last year . the blackhawks had n't been at staples###center since both clubs' season###opener jan . 19 , when chicago spoiled the kings' banner raising ceremony with a 5 2 victory . notes williams and chicago rw patrick###sharp nearly fought early in the game while scuffling for position before a faceoff , but linesmen kept them apart . he asked me to fight , sharp said . if he asks me again , i 'll fight him any day he wants . ... d jake muzzin returned to the kings' lineup after sitting out in favor of alec###martinez in game . ... carter went to the dressing###room for repairs after keith 's high stick . sharp went to the dressing###room late in the second period after a big###hit from brown , but he returned to the bench for the third period . ... tom###cruise and jim###belushi attended the game .
growing up in south###carolina , the daughter of a minister and a deacon , danielle brooks never planned on a stint in federal###prison . in middle###school , she visited a juvenile###justice complex . they gave us a tour of the jail , ms . brooks recalled . the handcuffs , the walking in a straight###line , the smell . i was like this is totally not a place for me . but fresh from juilliard , she landed the role of the brash , swaggering tasha jefferson , known as taystee , on the new netflix series orange is the new black , based on piper kerman 's memoir about her stint in the pen for money###laundering and drug###trafficking . while other inmates struggle with life in prison , taystee struts down the hallways , sings in the shower , and dominates the prison library , where she offers an astute critique of joyce 's rambling ulysses ai n't nobody got time for that . taystee even seems to embrace the beige prison issue jumpsuit . but on a recent morning at corner social , a lively cafe near her harlem apartment , ms . brooks , 23 , wore a more exuberant outfit burgundy dress , orange heels , and colossal earrings woven from brightly###colored african cloth . with her huge smile and throaty laugh , she spoke to alexis soloski about playlists and hair###care on the inside . these are excerpts from the conversation . q . what was your first role ? a . i started###acting when i was 6 years old in a church play , a christmas pageant . i played baby###girl . and my mother played my grandmother , though i promise you she does n't look that old . everybody was like she 's so good ! so my mama started###sending me to acting programs . how did you research the role of taystee ? i have always been fascinated with women in prison , and i 'd watched a lot of tv shows and reality shows , like beyond scared straight . so i was already prepared . taystee 's the light of the prison . she finds the joy in that place . do shakespeare and chekhov prepare you to roll on the ground in a hair pulling catfight ? no . all of the voice###training , all of the alexander training , at some point that gets thrown out the window , because that 's not what this character needs . but juilliard has trained me to stay truthful in the moment . most of taystee 's lines are very profane . was it ever hard to say them ? there were times i was nervous about what my family back home would say . but i want to play characters rooted in truth . and it 's exciting to be someone else , to say all these crazy###things , to do all these crazy###things . my dad came for the premiere . i kind of prepared him for it . he loved it . he had respect for what i did . my family understands that i still have my morals . did you get tired of that same beige jumpsuit ? it was cool not to have to think about it . you come to work and you know what you 're going to wear , how it 's going to fit . all of us want to be in chanel or michael###kors , but this was refreshing . being alone would be my biggest###fear , figuring out who i could trust , making sure i had people to take care of me . what would help you get by ? i would really need music , a cd###player or something jill###scott , ledisi , le'andria johnson . and i would have to have some rap . the gospel###music would help me to relax . the rap would help if someone messed with me , so i 'd feel like i could beat them up . hair###care clearly matters to taystee . how would you manage your hair inside ? it would probably be braided up a lot or in big poof balls . i would find ways to be creative , to spice it up . i 'd need miss jessie 's , kinky curly , some shea###butter , and water . you always need water .
dallas president###obama has left little mystery about how he views his predecessor . the failed policies of george w . bush wiped away a budget###surplus and squandered the legacy of bipartisan foreign###policy . mr . bush put two wars on a credit###card , led the country away from our values and crashed the economy . but mr . obama will surely say none of that when he helps dedicate the george w . bush###presidential###library and museum on thursday . addressing a crowd of bush supporters and administration veterans , the 44th president will no doubt extol the virtues of the 43rd and praise his years of service to the country . it has become an awkward ritual of the modern presidency that the current occupant of the oval###office is called upon to deliver a generous historical judgment of the previous one . with the opening of each new presidential###library , the members of the world 's most exclusive fraternity put aside partisan differences to honor the shared###experience of running the nation in difficult###times . the task in such moments is especially acute when , as with mr . obama and mr . bush , the current and previous###presidents come from opposing###parties and such different sensibilities . the incumbent must hit grace###notes without appearing inconsistent with past criticism or , worse , hypocritical . sometimes a president goes through the motions , dutifully reading what aides put before him . other times , library dedications have become bonding moments when presidents genuinely grow###closer . when a president dedicates the library of someone he opposed politically , it 's interesting and a bit of a challenge , said michael waldman , who was the chief speechwriter for president###bill###clinton when he helped president george###bush open his library in . the best thing to do is focus on something that you can really embrace and mean it . kenneth khachigian , a chief speechwriter for president###ronald###reagan , said there was a formula if you 're a speechwriter , you can write a really nice speech about how americans can fight and disagree and debate , but at the end of the day we 're all americans and we have the same goals , and i 've###learned that anybody who sits in this office really at the end of the day has the best interest of everyone at heart . that is a fair summation of what reagan said in dedicating president###jimmy###carter 's library in october . in that case , the dedication came in the midst of a midterm###election campaign , so the moment of conciliation was followed just weeks later by fairly tough language on the campaign trail in which reagan criticized mr . carter 's policies . with no election at hand , mr . obama has more latitude , not having to worry about alienating his base , which still loathes mr . bush . a gracious speech could also fit into his outreach to congressional republicans . the timing of the legislative calendar does give him some fodder for common###ground with mr . bush . as he fights to liberalize the immigration system , mr . obama could use the speech to point out that he and mr . bush agree on the issue , implicitly pressuring other republicans to join them . that is not to say that mr . obama is putting away his partisan hat altogether . he flew to dallas on wednesday , a day early , to appear at a democratic fund###raiser . at the ceremony on thursday at the new bush center , on the campus of southern###methodist###university , he will be joined by the elder mr . bush , mr . carter and mr . clinton . at the event on wednesday , mr . obama told donors i 'm really looking forward to attending the bush library opening tomorrow . one of the things i will insist upon is whatever our political differences , president###bush loves this country and loves its people and shares that same concern , and was concerned about all people in america , not just those who voted###republican . but mr . bush 's circle is anticipating the encounter with a certain suspicion . while the former president retreated to texas after leaving###office and has refrained from criticizing his successor , mr . obama made mr . bush a foil on the campaign trail , attributing the country 's problems to the situation he inherited . a huge part of his messaging platform for his presidency has been the contrast , laying it off on his predecessor , said dan bartlett , who was the white###house counselor under mr . bush . he 's going to have to thread the needle . mr . bush 's advisers bristled at mr . obama 's inaugural###address in , when the new president criticized our collective failure to make hard###choices and assured the world that we are ready to lead once more . they also thought that mr . obama was grudging when he unveiled mr . bush 's portrait at the white###house in . although mr . obama praised his predecessor 's extraordinary strength and resolve after the sept . 11 attacks , he noted just how breathtaking the financial###crisis he had left behind turned out to be . marc thiessen , a chief speechwriter in the bush white###house , said the test on thursday would be whether mr . obama could be substantively generous , not just personally generous . in other words , would mr . obama acknowledge that despite their differences over iraq , health###care and other issues , mr . bush accomplished worthy things in office , like his fight against aids in africa ? he 's never going to say this , mr . thiessen said , but if he 's being totally honest , he would say that except for interrogations , he adopted almost the entire bush counterterrorism policy , some of it voluntarily , some of it involuntarily , but most of it voluntarily . mr . obama and mr . bush have more in common than either might admit . they both value discipline and an orderly operation . they are both politicians intent on transformational presidencies . they both proved polarizing even though they arrived in washington promising bipartisanship . but they have never connected in a meaningful way , leaving many in both camps to watch closely how they interact on thursday . past library openings have proved to be bonding moments mr . clinton praised the elder mr . bush at his library opening in , and both bushes returned the favor at his dedication seven years later . mr . clinton was touched and has since become a virtual adopted member of the bush###family . it was 2004 at the dedication of the clinton library where the friendship was really renewed , said james l . rutherford iii ,

betty###boop began her life as a floppy eared dog and ended it as a happy homemaker dressed in an apron . but at her peak roughly from 1931 to 1934 she was a major figure in american movies , despite being , as her theme###song put it , made of pen and ink . created by the new york animators the fleischer brothers ( max , the eldest of the three , produced lou animated and later supervised the music their little brother , dave , directed , she was , as the animation historian donald crafton puts it in his recent###study , shadow of a mouse ( university###of###california###press , one of the earliest cartoon characters to be a fully fleshed out human being and the only classic 'toon star generated as female ( neither minnie nor daisy were leading###ladies . betty 's design was a curious combination of the infantile ( her gigantic head , tiny mouth and big , round###eyes ) and the unmistakably adult ( her curvy figure , accented by a little black###dress that emphasized her perky d colletage and revealed an anachronistic garter encircling one shapely thigh . she represents a disturbing alliance of an absolute innocence and a knowing , adult sensuality a description that could also apply in general to the fleischers' animated work , at least until the renewed enforcement of the production code in the summer of 1934 took , as another of her songs put it , her boop oop a doop away . the fleischers made most of their cartoons for release through paramount###pictures , though the rights to the films have changed###hands###many###times , beginning when paramount sold its pre 1950 short subjects to the television syndicator u.m . m . in . ( rather than the familiar paramount mountain , most of the surviving###copies of the fleischer shorts still bear the u.m . m . logo , which the television company spliced into the original negatives of the films when they were acquired . ) now , through a highly circuitous###route , the fleischer films have come to reside again at paramount , and that company has begun licensing them for their first official appearance on blu###ray through the independent###distributor olive films . a first volume , which includes 12 newly###remastered shorts that olive claims have never before been available on dvd or blu###ray , comes out this week a second volume will be released on sept . 24 . with the crispness and clarity of the original pen###and###ink###drawings restored , the films look better than they have in generations . though they may lack color and volume and anything more than the most rudimentary sense of renaissance perspective ( these were all elements that disney would develop , in conscious contradistinction to the fleischers , in the mid to late 30s , they do possess exquisite graphic qualities , in particular a calligraphic sense of line that strongly###suggests an individual artist 's hand . the fleischers played on that conceit in their silent###era , pre boop cartoons , collectively titled out of the inkwell , through an innovative blend of live###action and animation that made it appear that a flesh and blood cartoonist ( usually played by max ) brought the characters to life by dipping his pen and sketching them on a drawing pad , at which point they would take on wills and identities of their own . betty###boop 's rise to fame , a fascinatingly self reflective 1934 piece in which a journalist interviews uncle max about the career of his most famous creation , pays###homage to those early###films by having max summon up betty from an inkwell on his desk , and dropping her down into background sketches from three previous shorts . just as walt###disney 's early cartoons evoked the rural###background of his boyhood experience in kansas , so did the fleischers' work reflect their upbringing in a richly ethnic new york###city . ( when betty meets some south###sea islanders in betty###boop 's bamboo isle , they greet her with shalom aleichem ! ) where disney was inspired by farm###animals , the fleischers found their models in the denizens of times###square , where their studios were long located . betty is obviously a seasoned vaudevillian , always ready to break into songs and snappy patter for the ad###hoc audiences that gather around her . in her first appearance , in the 1930 dizzy dishes ( not in the present collection , betty bumps and grinds as a canine chanteuse in a cabaret patronized by cats , gorillas and hippopotamuses she 's clearly meant to be a caricature of the broadway singer helen###kane ( who popularized boop boop a doop as a catchphrase , though when kane sued paramount for wrongful appropriation of her act after betty became a star , the singer lost the suit . ( betty was performed by several voice###actors over the years , but most indelibly by mae###questel , who doubled as olive###oyl in the fleischers' popeye series . ) by the time betty became the star of her own series in , she had become a recognizably human figure whose closest###associates remained , mysteriously , a dog ( bimbo ) and a circus###clown ( koko ) who had appeared in previous fleischer films . although bimbo and koko usually behave like children , the films frequently find them leering at their scantily###clad companion , and when she passes , even inanimate###objects have a way of responding to her that does not require freudian analysis . and yet , the baby faced betty seems unaware of the erotic spell she casts on the anthropomorphic world around her , even when , in bamboo isle , her hip swiveling , topless hula dance prompts a flower to uproot itself and dive headfirst into the sand . much later , marilyn###monroe would feign a similar na###vet in films like gentlemen###prefer###blondes to evade the censors ( she clearly could n't be blamed for something she was n't conscious of , and for a while it worked for betty , too . but as hollywood shifted toward the enforced wholesomeness of the production code , even betty 's cartoon sexuality could not stand . at first , the fleischers combated her perceived promiscuity by giving her a steady boyfriend ( a tom of finland type named freddie , but even that connection had vanished by the end of the series . the final cartoon in this set , the foxy hunter from , finds betty playing single mom to two new characters , an entirely too adorable puppy named pudgy and a little boy named junior . as the two kid friendly characters get into predictable scrapes , betty stays home in the kitchen , her gams veiled in a prim housedress , as she labors over a mixing bowl . but the wily fleischers may have left a hint of betty 's scarlet past . hey , junior who 's your daddy ?

the autopsy results for cullen finnerty , the star college quarterback found dead in the michigan woods in late may , revealed thursday that he had chronic###traumatic###encephalopathy , or c.t.e. , the degenerative brain disease found in the autopsies of several former n.f.l . players . in telephone interviews , however , doctors who studied finnerty 's brain cautioned against the obvious and increasingly familiar narrative that football and the hits finnerty endured while playing it could be blamed for his death . family members expressed a similar sentiment . there is no reason to jump to the conclusion that football played an important###role in cullen 's death , said dr . robert stern , a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at boston###university and a founder of the university 's center for the study of traumatic encephalopathy . there are just too many possible variables . we will never truly know what caused his death . that 's the truth of it . stern added there has been way too much publicity about football leading to people 's deaths . it is just too complicated for a simplistic summary like that . the lake county###sheriff 's department released a summary of finnerty 's autopsy results , more than two months after a search###party found finnerty in a clearing . he had been reported###missing in baldwin , mich . , after he went fishing by himself and disappeared . the summary surmised that finnerty died from pneumonia , complicated by oxycodone toxicity and c.t.e . the findings were , according to finnerty 's father and doctors familiar with the case , at best a theory as to how finnerty had died . the autopsy found a###level of oxycodone in finnerty 's system slightly above what would be considered therapeutic , along with traces of other medication he had been prescribed by a doctor . finnerty 's father , tim , said his son had been prescribed thyroid medication and testosterone , in addition to the oxycodone , for severe###pain in his lower back . finnerty also had a blood###alcohol###content of . 015 percent , his father said , and alcohol is not believed to have contributed to his death . finnerty , according to the autopsy summary , most likely became disoriented and incapacitated , vomited and inhaled the vomit , which caused the pneumonia . his brain was studied at the center for the study of traumatic encephalopathy at boston###university , which found he had stage 2 c.t.e . there are four stages of c.t.e. , and b.u. , in a statement , labeled stage 2 as moderate . at b.u. , finnerty 's brain was examined by dr . ann mckee , chief neuropathologist at the v.a . boston healthcare system and a professor of neurology and pathology at boston###university 's school of medicine . she identified multiple lesions in the frontal and temporal###lobes of the brain , a pattern consistent with c.t.e . stern said it was highly unlikely that c.t.e . alone would have led to finnerty 's death . c.t.e . could have affected finnerty 's judgment , insight and behavior , but other factors like the conditions and the medications in finnerty 's system would have to be taken into account . the release of the autopsy results provided the finnerty family little solace . the only ones who will ever know what happened are cullen and god , tim finnerty said . we 're still dealing with our own grief . last month , finnerty 's extended###family took its usual summer###vacation to the cedar###point amusement###park in ohio . cullen loved that trip , his father said , a week filled with roller###coasters and family barbecues . this year , family members lighted lanterns in his memory and sent them out into the water , as they hugged and cried and shared stories . it was tough , believe me , tim finnerty said . it still is . he loved life so much . he loved his wife . he loved those kids . tim finnerty paused to compose himself . his son was 30 when he died , and he left behind a wife and two young###children . for the past two months , tim finnerty has spent most days at the house his son lived in . he plans to coach his grandson , 3 year old caden , in soccer this fall . tim finnerty was a longtime football###coach . he started###coaching high###school###football in 1975 and stopped before last season . football was the family 's centerpiece , and cullen starred at grand###valley###state , a division###ii powerhouse , where he won###three###national###championships . cullen finnerty played###quarterback with a reckless abandon , but he sustained only one documented concussion in college . he sought contact and delivered more punishment than he took . he spent time with the baltimore###ravens and the denver###broncos , after which he played in austria and a small level arena###football###league . there was another recent incident , in which finnerty drove from the detroit area to grand###rapids , mich . , where his brother lived . he was paranoid and convinced someone was following him . no one was . other than that , the family did not witness any signs that finnerty was suffering . in fact , shortly before his death , he had been promoted he worked in medical sales and had baptized his infant daughter , the whole finnerty clan in tow . a memorial golf scramble is scheduled for later this month in finnerty 's hometown , brighton , mich . i certainly would n't discourage kids from playing###football , tim finnerty said . but i do hope these studies help make the sport safer , through equipment or new rules . i hope we can learn from what happened to cullen .

washington the obama administration said saturday that it had reduced the error###rate in enrollment data sent to insurance###companies under the new health###care law , even as insurers said that the government 's records were still riddled with mistakes . the quality of the data is important it could affect the ability of people to get medical care and prescription###drugs when they go to doctors' offices and pharmacies starting next month . more than , 000 people selected health plans in the federal insurance marketplace in october and november , and administration officials say more than , 000 signed up in the first week of this month . for each person who signs up , the government is supposed to send###information electronically to an insurance###company in a standard###format known as an 834 enrollment transaction . in some cases , consumers selected a health plan at the federal website , healthcare . gov , but the government did not notify the insurance###company . in other cases , insurers received duplicate files for the same person , files for one person were sent to an insurer in another state , or the relationship code was wrong so that , for example , a man 's daughter was listed as his wife . the white###house said saturday that the government was now informing insurance###companies of nearly all new enrollments . julie bataille , a spokeswoman at the federal centers###for###medicare###and###medicaid###services , acknowledged that the government had failed to inform insurance###companies about some people who had chosen health plans on healthcare . gov , but she said the number of such cases from oct . 1 to dec . 5 was lower than , 000 . since the beginning of december , missing 834s as a percentage of total enrollments has been close to zero down from 15 percent in the two weeks starting oct . 13 , she said . ms . bataille said most of the problems occurred from oct . 1 to mid###november , as enrollment reports on some consumers were either not being generated , or had errors due to larger technical system issues . on tuesday and wednesday , the government sent information to insurers listing everyone who had enrolled in a plan through the federal marketplace . insurers are supposed to compare the information with their own records and with the daily reports they received from the government over the last 10 weeks . insurers said that they had found many discrepancies and errors and that the government was overstating the improvements in healthcare . gov . in some instances , they said , the federal###government reported that the home###address for a new policyholder was outside an insurer 's service area . in other cases , a child was listed as the main subscriber the person responsible for paying premiums and parents were listed as dependents . in some cases , children were enrolled in a policy by the federal###government and parents were left off , or vice versa . in other cases , the government mixed up the members of a family a child or spouse was listed two or three times in the same application in late###november . such errors can have financial###implications , increasing the amount of premiums that a family is required to pay . while some of the problems were discovered in the last few days , insurers said that they had previously###reported many of the errors to the help desk at the centers###for###medicare###and###medicaid###services , and that the problems remained###unresolved . federal officials , insurers and health###care###providers said they were concerned about confusion and possible chaos in the early###days of january , when people try to use the new insurance###coverage they believe they have . the government 's overriding message to insurers is do whatever you have to do to maximize enrollment and to provide coverage by jan . 1 to anyone who wants it . federal health officials have told insurers that they can sort out the details and work out financial###arrangements with the government later . people have until dec . 23 to sign up for coverage that begins in january , and they have until dec . 31 to pay premiums for the first month . but the administration has encouraged insurers to relax those deadlines and to take other steps to ensure a smooth###transition for customers . some of the new enrollees have never had insurance . others turned to the federal exchange because their current###policies were being canceled or discontinued because they do not comply with coverage requirements of the new health###care law .
washington one company threatened###to###sue , 000 coffee###shops , hotels and retailers for patent###infringement because they had set up wi###fi networks for their customers . another claimed that hundreds of small###businesses were violating its patents by attaching a document scanner to an office computer system . one claimed rights to royalties from anyone producing a podcast . now the obama administration is cracking down on what many call patent trolls , shell companies that exist merely for the purpose of asserting that they should be paid because they hold patents that are being infringed by some software or electronic process . the companies exploded onto the technology scene in the last two years , accounting for more than half of the , 000 patent###infringement lawsuits filed in the united###states last year , according to several studies , up from 45 percent the year before and from less than 30 percent in every prior year . that surge can be traced partly to the very law that was supposed to stamp out some of the trouble . the america invents act , signed in , made it illegal to file a single lawsuit claiming a whole bunch of defendants had infringed a patent in the same way . now , a patent###holder must file individual lawsuits against each company , which has caused the number of lawsuits to soar , patent experts say . on tuesday , president###obama took direct aim at the companies and their practices , announcing several executive###orders to protect innovators from frivolous litigation by patent trolls . mr . obama ordered the patent and trademark office to require companies to be more specific about exactly what their patent covers and how it is being infringed . the administration also told the patent office to tighten scrutiny of overly broad patent claims and said it would aim to curb patent###infringement lawsuits against consumers and small###business###owners who are simply using off the shelf technology . but some big software companies , including microsoft , expressed###dismay at some of the proposals , saying they could themselves stifle innovation . a trade group known as bsa the software alliance , which represents software companies , urged caution . some of the white###house proposals are problematic , matt reid , senior###vice###president for external###affairs for the group , said in a statement . mr . reid said a proposal to expand the patent office 's program allowing for special review of computer related###patents could inadvertently put at risk innovation for many industries that rely on software , from manufacturing to biotech . changing measures that have been in effect for less than a year before we see the results does n't make sense , he said . some states have decided to act . vermont passed a law last month that would allow companies singled out by patent###infringement lawsuits to sue their tormentors . usually companies cannot fight back by countersuing because the patent trolls do n't make anything that itself could violate a company 's patents . in vermont , companies that bring patent lawsuits and lose could be forced to pay the legal###fees of the winning side and damages up to , 000 . vermont has one of the highest per capita rates of issued###patents in the country . lawmakers encountered###resistance in 2011 to some of the measures mr . obama ordered on tuesday . the opposition came from , among others , pharmaceutical###companies that feared that the legislation would hinder their ability to defend their own patents . representative robert w . goodlatte , a virginia republican who is chairman of the house###judiciary###committee and drafting a bill to address the patent###troll issue , said at a panel###discussion tuesday that the opposition was stiff enough that it led a number of people to believe that it was going to delay overall patent reform . mr . goodlatte said the jump in the number of lawsuits brought the issue back to the fore . arti k . rai , a patent###law professor at duke###university , said in an interview that those numbers are a little bit manipulated .
gibraltar gibraltar , the british territory at the tip of the iberian###peninsula , has long been a political sore###point between britain and spain . but now , in an internet gambling dispute , it 's briton vs . briton . officials and executives in the territory 's thriving online###gambling industry are crying foul over prime###minister david###cameron 's plan to impose a 15 percent tax on residents of britain who place###bets on gibraltar 's dozens of sites . people here in this tiny outpost , which evokes england with its red phone booths and helmeted police###officers , see the proposed tax as an unfair revenue grab by the london government . while britain is responsible for the territory 's military and international###relations , gibraltar has significant autonomy over trade and industry issues , including the ability to set taxes . what gibraltar cannot necessarily control is taxes that london imposes on britons in britain . the tax would be clearly against the common###sense logic of electronic###commerce , said phill brear , gibraltar 's gambling commissioner . he said that about 60 percent of online bets by britons were placed through gibraltar sites . we now hear a lot of talk in the u.k . about creating a###level playing###field . but you can in fact never level the field between high###street shops and online###services . the proposed 15 percent tax , the same as that imposed on britons who bet within britain , would be a sharp markup from the 1 percent that gibraltar currently levies . the plan , which mr . cameron wants to take effect by december , would also make it compulsory for gibraltar based###companies to have a british license to serve british clients . companies would thus face the same rules as betting###shop operators back in britain , like william###hill and ladbrokes . but william###hill and ladbrokes are also active in gibraltar 's online wagering industry , meaning they would get ensnared by the new tax . the change would put a huge and unwanted cost on our business , said steve buchanan , who heads the gibraltar operations of ladbrokes . mr . buchanan added that gibraltar had other advantages , even if the new gambling tax were adopted . he noted that gibraltar applied no value added taxation on advertising and other activities essential to the gambling sector , unlike the 20 percent tax levied in britain . when betfair , another british operator , announced its move to gibraltar in , it said it would save 20 million , or 30 million , annually in taxes . before online###gambling companies started###settling here about 15 years###ago , gibraltar had only one casino , dating from the 1960s . even now , this promontory of . 6 square###miles , or . 7 square###kilometers , commonly known as the rock , in no way resembles las###vegas or other neon bathed casino capitals . instead , it looks like a quaint english town with the added flourish of a colony of macaque monkeys . but online###gambling is big###business , as people around the world log on to place all sorts of bets . recently , there was brisk wagering on the birth###date and name of the royal baby and whether the international soccer star gareth###bale would soon switch teams . the industry represents about 15 percent of gibraltar 's . 89 billion economy , and gambling companies provide###jobs for about , 500 of gibraltar 's , 000 residents . even with the worldwide financial doldrums , the business continues to grow . four more gibraltar based operators entered the field in the last year , raising the total to 25 each of which might operate several web###sites . ladbrokes , like other companies that operate in gibraltar , manages its online business from a large , nondescript building , where employees sit###in front of rows of screens , monitoring the casino games or tracking bets on soccer matches and horse races . rather than a bookie shop , it looks more like the trading###floor of an investment###bank . now , the industry is gearing up for a fight , setting up a common legal fund to help pay for a court challenge in the european###union . their argument is that the british tax is a protectionist measure that violates the union 's free###market rules . mr . brear also warned in an interview that the new taxes would encourage gamblers to switch to less regulated online markets in the caribbean and elsewhere . the model of prohibition and higher###taxes has been tried before , fabian###picardo , the head of the gibraltar government , comparing gambling tax proposal to the united###states' ban against alcohol from 1919 to . if the u.k . takes the tax approach that it is proposing , he said , it would be devastating for the u.k . itself . when the draft bill was published in december , the government emphasized the need to monitor gambling and the sector 's possible links to organized###crime . philip graf , chairman of the british gambling###commission , noted that his agency currently had limited control over suspicious betting transactions because it regulated less than 20 percent of online###gambling by british consumers , who instead do most of their betting offshore . these proposals will ensure that british consumers enjoy consistent standards of protection , regardless of where a gambling business is based , the british minister for sport , hugh robertson , said last year .
based on their size , male koalas should have a mating call that sounds like a human baby 's cry . but the call is actually closer in pitch to an elephant 's rumble . that is because koalas have a special sound producing organ not previously seen in any land###dwelling mammal , researchers say . in the larynx the vocal###cords were normal , but outside there were these fleshy lips , said david reby , a researcher at the university of sussex in england who was involved with the study , described in the journal current###biology . the fleshy lips are found in the koala 's soft###palate , at the junction of the oral and nasal cavities . dr . reby 's colleague benjamin charlton , the study 's lead author , inserted a pump and an endoscopic camera into the trachea of a euthanized koala in australia to observe how the vocal###folds vibrated and produced sound . when the koalas inhale they tense these lips , and it allows them to exaggerate their size through sound , dr . reby said . as a rule , an animal 's size reflects the dimensions of its vocal###folds , which limit the lowest frequency an animal can reach . smaller###species tend to have calls with a higher###frequency . the message here is that when there is a need to communicate something , evolution can lead to the emergence of new organs , dr . reby said .
anaheim , calif . sitting with his father in the upper reaches of the decrepit los###angeles###memorial###sports###arena and watching the dreadful clippers play , coco###crisp learned growing up what it meant to develop a bond with a team . the building might have been crumbling , the crowd was often sparse and the expectations low , but if the clippers were not the lakers , then they were at least his team . that childhood experience may have been a useful one for crisp , the center###fielder and catalyst for the oakland###athletics , who are marooned in a rundown stadium and typically play before small crowds and in the shadow of the san###francisco###giants , who have won two of the last three world###series . the lakers are like hollywood , said crisp , who now sits in the front row along the visitors' bench when he attends clippers games . you dress up , you go there almost like a club atmosphere . for the clippers , you go there to watch the game . it 's kind of like an oakland type of a thing . the fans and the players are a lot closer . the fans are into the game . low###budget and largely unappreciated , the athletics are somewhat unexpectedly back in the playoffs , rolling past the star###studded angels and the battle tested rangers to win the american###league###west . they will reprise last year 's thrilling division###series with detroit , beginning at home friday###night . their story is part of a broader theme of the postseason the presence of so many teams oakland , pittsburgh and tampa###bay that spent their small payrolls wisely , and the absence of profligate spenders like the yankees , the angels and the phillies . third baseman josh###donaldson may be the athletics' best player and will draw consideration for american###league###most###valuable###player , but he was not popular enough to make the all star game . and the foundation of their success is a young , largely###unrecognized pitching staff that has finished second in the american###league in earned###run###average the last two seasons . but if there is a player who embodies the athletics , it is crisp , and not simply for his colorful name , his evolving hairstyles ( from cornrows to blown out afro to tightly cropped with a trimmed goatee ) and his often elaborate celebratory handshakes , each tailored to a particular teammate . the athletics play the game much the way crisp does , with the fervor of an underdog . the intensity in the way he goes out and plays , the intensity in his at bats he is in the at bat if you get one or two guys that are intense and focused , the younger guys are feeding off that , said chili###davis , the athletics' hitting coach . he starts things and keeps them going . manager bob###melvin said he 's a sparkplug . when he plays well , we play well . it is not surprising , then , that since the middle of august , the athletics and crisp have been rolling . oakland , along with st . louis , has been a baseball best 29 14 since aug . 14 , and crisp has hit as well in that stretch as in any other in his 12 year career . over the last six weeks , he has belted 12 home###runs more than he hit in any of the previous seven seasons and driven in 26 runs , while batting . 293 with 5 stolen###bases from his leadoff spot . it 's just one of those years , said crisp , who received a cortisone shot in his left###wrist in mid###august . next year i might hit one home###run and steal 100 bases . well , probably not , but you just never know from year to year what might happen . this is just one of those years . i ca n't###explain it . in the process , crisp , who turns 34 next month , appears to be making the athletics' decision to pick up the . 5 million option on his contract next season not much of a decision at all . i had a friend who came to a game , and the only players he had heard of were bartolo and coco , said the athletics' owner , lew wolff , referring to pitcher bartolo colon . he asked , 'who 's the rest of the team ? ' crisp 's finding a home in oakland was an unlikely development on several fronts . growing up , he attended four high###schools in four years in the los###angeles area , then two colleges in two years before beginning his journey in professional###baseball . he spent three full seasons in cleveland and boston , but he had little security in either place . he helped the red###sox to the 2007 world###series , but lost his starting###job to jacoby###ellsbury during the playoffs .

( a rule###change from the off season meant the vikings should have been charged a timeout but should not have been penalized the yardage . ) it was the second big miscue for leavy 's crew in the season 's first three weeks in week , san###francisco was given an extra third down against green###bay . seahawks , jaguars 17 russell###wilson matched his career###high with four touchdown passes two each to sidney###rice and zach###miller as host seattle improved to 3 0 for the first time since . lions , redskins 20 detroit beat washington away from home for the first time since , a 21 game streak that was the second longest in n.f.l . history . detroit 's last road victory in the series was against the boston###redskins , two years before the team 's move to washington . matthew###stafford threw for 385 yards for the lions , who also took advantage of a pair of fourth###quarter bobbles . the score was tied at 17 17 when robert###griffin###iii fumbled at the end of a scramble as he dived headfirst instead of sliding . the lions recovered and kicked the go ahead field###goal on their next drive . a redskins touchdown pass was then overturned when the video replay showed that aldrick robinson had lost control of the ball . saints , cardinals 7 jimmy###graham caught nine passes for 134 yards and 2 touchdowns for host new orleans , whose defense had four sacks and two interceptions of arizona 's carson###palmer . cowboys , rams 7 tony###romo threw for three scores as dallas won at home . st . louis avoided the shutout with a###4 yard sam###bradford pass to austin pettis late in the third quarter after an interception by the cowboys was wiped out by a roughing the passer penalty .
based on the discovery of a single tooth , researchers say they have identified an ancient species of giant platypus . the finding provides new clues about the lineage of the modern platypus . the fossil###record is very , very patchy for the platypus , and these are a unique group of mammals , said the lead###researcher , rebecca pian , a vertebrate paleontologist at columbia###university and the american###museum###of###natural###history . unlike most mammals , they lay eggs instead of giving###birth to live offspring their snouts are covered with electroreceptors that can detect underwater prey and the male has a venomous spur on its hind feet . there are only three other known species of extinct platypus . the newly###discovered one was probably more than three feet long , twice the size of the modern platypus . from the bumps and ridges on the fossilized tooth , the researchers think it was an aquatic mammal that lived in freshwater pools , dining on crayfish and freshwater crustaceans as well as small###vertebrates like lungfish , frogs and turtles . ms . pian , now a doctoral###student at columbia , worked on the research as an undergraduate at the university of new south###wales in australia . she and her colleagues from the university discovered the ancient tooth in the riversleigh world###heritage###area of northwest queensland . they describe the extinct platypus in the journal###of###vertebrate###paleontology .
the federal###aviation###administration is expected on friday to approve boeing 's plans to fix the batteries on its new 787 dreamliner jets , a decision that could soon allow the planes to return to service after being grounded for more than three months . people briefed on the matter said the f.a.a . administrator , michael p . huerta , and transportation###secretary ray###lahood were satisfied that boeing 's changes would virtually eliminate concerns that the lithium###ion###batteries could erupt in smoke or fire . their decision could enable the innovative planes to begin flying again in may after they are refitted with more insulation between the battery cells and a new system for venting smoke or hazardous gases out of the planes . aviation analysts said the problems had cost boeing hundreds of millions###of###dollars and slowed its progress in fielding the planes , which reduce fuel costs by 20 percent and have been in great###demand by the airlines . the 50 jets delivered so far were grounded worldwide after two incidents in january in which the volatile new batteries caught fire or emitted smoke . boeing has said the new battery systems are ready to go , and it will install them on the planes it has already delivered before changing the jets still in production . the government 's decision to approve the fixes was not a surprise . the f.a.a . 's engineers oversaw boeing 's design of the changes as well as more than 20 types of tests conducted on them over the last month . boeing had said that it had successfully wrapped up the tests in a flight by a 787 on april . the approval also will come before the national###transportation###safety###board holds hearings on tuesday and wednesday on a battery fire on jan . 7 in a 787 that was parked in boston . the board also is examining how boeing and the f.a.a . underestimated any risks in approving the original battery design in .

talked , anthony said . this is a fun weekend . garnett said actually , i 've seen carmelo a couple minutes ago . it was good to see him here . i 'm happy for him . that 's what this weekend is about , nothing negative . it was quite a change from jan . 7 , when anthony went after garnett following the boston###celtics' win over the knicks at madison###square###garden and shouted obscenities outside the boston locker###room and later near the celtics' bus . anthony was suspended by the n.b.a . for one game . anthony said he would play in the all star game despite bruising his right bicep during wednesday 's 92 88 loss to the toronto###raptors . that night , anthony was not sure if he would play this weekend . the day after , it was sore , but once i got some treatment , we found it was n't as deep of a contusion as i thought it was , he said . i feel###pretty good for the most part . during practice on saturday , anthony will talk to the east 's coach , erik###spoelstra , about how many minutes he should play . spoelstra said he expected to limit anthony 's playing time . for his part , garnett clarified an earlier comment that this all star weekend would definitely be the last one of his career . i should have never said that , said garnett , a 15 time all star . i was n't comfortable with solidifying that i was going to be an all star next year . king among hall finalists carmelo###anthony said he was glad to see that bernard###king was a finalist for the hall of fame . anthony 's style is similar to king 's . king , a four time all star and a former knick who was previously nominated as a finalist , was a prolific###scorer in the paint and from the perimeter . he averaged . 5 points a game in his 15 year career . i became a student of bernard###king just watching some of his game tapes and seeing his go to moves , anthony said . he definitely belongs in the hall of fame . he should have been in there a long time ago . the other finalists are tim###hardaway , gary###payton , mitch###richmond , maurice###cheeks , rick###pitino , guy###lewis , jerry###tarkanian , spencer###haywood , the longtime north###carolina women 's coach sylvia hatchell and the five time w.n.b.a . all star dawn###staley . tom###heinsohn , already inducted as a player , is a finalist in the coaching category . richie###guerin , who played nine seasons with

over the court for limited seating . there will also be a state of the art scoreboard and a remodeled ceiling . new orleans will host next year 's all star game . the nets hosted the game in 1982 at the meadowlands the knicks hosted it in . the most fun i 've had in an all star game was the one in new york , kevin###garnett said . that was kobe 's first one , michael###jordan was there and it was in new york . that was a special one for me . big###night for a knick james white thought he would be in the slam###dunk###contest a few years###ago . white also felt that he would sign a guaranteed contract with an n.b.a . team . white , 30 , finally###achieved those goals this season , in his first year with the knicks after several years overseas . white , given the nickname flight in college , hopes to show why by winning saturday 's dunk###contest . he has played little this season and is known mostly for a dunk###contest in russia in , when he beat gerald###green with a one handed dunk from the free###throw line . green will also be in saturday 's contest . for white , it will be the biggest individual performance of his career . i 've always dreamed about this moment since i was , honestly , he said . i 've always wanted to do this . i 'm glad i finally get the opportunity . carmelo###anthony said he expected white to win . i saw a couple of things , but i ca n't reveal them , anthony said of white 's planned dunks . we do n't call him flight for nothing .
los###angeles on a recent evening , peter shukoff and lloyd ahlquist , two breakout stars of the youtube era , were trying , very seriously , to look like teenage###girls from long hair , pink headbands , embroidered jeans . the duo founded epic###rap###battles###of###history , the zany yet knowing channel on youtube , which just began its third season . its videos stage fantastical smackdowns in musical rhyme , usually between historical icons and pop figures justin###bieber vs . beethoven , abe###lincoln vs . chuck###norris , mario###bros . vs . wright bros . on that evening , mr . shukoff and mr . ahlquist were on the set , filming a contest between miley###cyrus and joan of arc , to be uploaded on monday . they wanted to recreate a scene from the first ever hannah###montana episode , in which hannah , played by ms . cyrus , and her best friend touch fingers . the scene will only last seconds , but the men knew that some hannah###montana fans would go wild over the reference . so they went through some 40 takes to get it right . it is this gleeful pranksterism , combined with dedication to detail , that has catapulted epic rap battles into the top 15 of youtube 's most subscribed channels . of the millions of youtube creators worldwide , only about 450 have one million###subscribers or more epic has . 7 million . in fact , epic seems to have cracked the code on how to make reliably popular scripted content . it is the very type of entertainment that youtube , with its many one hit###wonders , says is relevant to its future . still , the pair acknowledge that any channel 's hold on the public is precarious , not least because , as mr . shukoff said in an interview , viewers are very fickle . the men hope that by giving their fans less one video every other monday during their new four month season they can keep them primed and interested . they also target fans of other shows like hannah###montana , hoping to bring them into the fold . so far , the strategy has worked the average battle is eventually watched 40 million###times , with a healthy helping of adolescent###boys . some videos have topped more than 70 million views , including repeated watchings , and sell well on itunes . in july , barack###obama vs . mitt###romney , uploaded in october , became the first youtube video to be certified as a gold single by the recording###industry###association###of###america , after the association started factoring in video###streaming last spring . ( the association counts 100 views as one sale . ) and , in another sign of the maturing of the medium , the two partners say that the internet , rather than television or cable , is the only place where they can rap seriously into the future . on the videos , the history is reasonably accurate , but the language , often unprintable , veers merrily into the offensive . in one showdown , einstein ruthlessly mocks stephen###hawking , the oxford cosmologist whose long battle with lou###gehrig 's disease has left him in a wheelchair when i apply my battle theory , minds are relatively blown so take a seat , steve oop , i see you brought your own . mr . ahlquist and mr . shukoff began in comedy , training in the late 1990s at improvolympic , now io , in chicago , whose alumni include tina###fey and amy###poehler . by then , rap was integrated into the scene . when you are free styling rap , it is like improv , mr . ahlquist said . it 's the same drug . it requires quickness on the feet and not being scared of not having a script . they bonded over rap but it was not until , when mr . ahlquist was running a comedy###club in santa###monica , calif . , that epic rap battles began to take shape . mr . shukoff , obsessed by online###video , had started his own youtube###channel . when mr . ahlquist told him about a rap battle in his comedy###club , mr . shukoff sensed the potential . he asked his youtube audience for suggestions . he received hundreds , including one proposal that he would have never imagined john###lennon vs . bill o'reilly . ( o'reilly to lennon you expletive long hair living in a yellow submarine well , you 're about to get sunk by the right wing political###machine . ) uploaded on sept . 26 , 2010 , that was their first rap battle . instead of casually winging it , they wore costumes and rehearsed the parts . the video was viewed , 000 times within two weeks . their second video , darth###vader vs . hitler , also suggested by fans , was viewed more than one million###times in five days . to expand their nascent franchise , they decided to work with maker###studios , which represents and promotes youtube artists . in exchange for a cut of the revenue , maker gave the performers access to its film stages and celebrity connections , like the rapper snoop###dogg , who agreed to appear in moses vs . santa###claus . ( snoop###dogg , who now prefers to be known as snoop###lion , was moses . ) like other youtube###videos , the duo 's productions are growing more sophisticated , with sets , scripts and special###effects . they now have a full time crew of eight , and help from maker 's production team . beat producers adapt the show 's music for the characters . the cadence of the music for gandhi vs . martin###luther###king###jr . , for example , is vaguely indian . and scripts and videos are embedded with tiny details for obsessed fans to discover . in the battle with einstein , mr . hawking 's computer screen briefly reveals that he is playing angry###birds . each script requires at least a week of research , mr . shukoff said . for a battle between steve###jobs and bill gates , he said he read a half###dozen books , including histories of computer programming . he also watched documentaries , including one about linux , the open###source operating system . all that work shows when hal , the domineering computer from the film a space odyssey , makes a surprise appearance i stomp on mac and pc , too i 'm on linux expletive i thought you gnu . for now , outsize popularity on youtube does not translate into hollywood size fame . usually , it is one cool dude in a bar who might recognize us , mr . ahlquist said . and money ? neither maker nor epic would reveal its revenues , but mr . shukoff still drives his 10 year old subaru .
the yankees returned###home from a 10 game west###coast road trip to a rainy forecast and gloomier injury news , heaping more strain on what has already amounted to a star crossed team in . shortly after the team announced tuesday that it had placed first baseman mark###teixeira on the 15 day disabled###list with inflammation in the injured right wrist that cost him nearly the first two full months of the season general###manager brian###cashman arrived to deliver the news that third baseman kevin###youkilis would miss the next 10 to 12 weeks because of surgery to repair a herniated disk . the team could ruminate on the misfortune for one more night . tuesday 's game against the los###angeles###dodgers , and the anticipated homecoming of dodgers manager don###mattingly , was postponed by rain . the teams will play a split doubleheader on wednesday . the yankees have reverted to where they were in april forced to tread water without their regular starting corner infielders ( teixeira and youkilis , shortstop ( derek###jeter ) and center###fielder ( curtis###granderson . that group does not include alex###rodriguez , who remains out indefinitely while he rehabilitates after a hip operation . the spotlight now could shift to cashman , whose off season acquisitions of lyle###overbay and vernon###wells helped stabilize a short handed team . since it has taken longer than expected for the yankees' stars to heal , more upgrades may be necessary . cashman signed youkilis to a one year , 12 million contract in december as cover for the absent rodriguez , but youkilis has played only 28 games , batting . 219 with 8 runs batted in . it 's not how we drew it up , cashman said . the yankees ( 38 31 ) are used to this refrain . the team is one of five to have used 40 players this season they used 45 all of last season and they have sent a player to the disabled###list 16 times already , only one fewer than in all of . losing youkilis for three months spreads the roster even thinner , with the rookie david###adams taking over at third base until rodriguez , jeter or possibly eduardo nunez ( strained oblique ) returns . it also places increased###pressure on cashman to find potential upgrades . i 've got to keep an eye on guys that we hope we can get back because those could be the saviors for us , cashman said . but up until this point , i 've been open for a lot of business and listening or engaging . manager joe###girardi was confident that teixeira would be activated as soon as his trip to the disabled###list was over , indicating that the move was made to give teixeira 's sore wrist additional rest . a magnetic###resonance###imaging test on sunday showed no additional###damage to the wrist . there 's not really hesitation in my mind that he would back when the 15 days are up , girardi said . teixeira said he hurt the wrist after swinging at balls on a tee with the hitting coach kevin long before saturday 's game against the los###angeles###angels . he said he felt it getting sore . during the game , it just did n't###feel right , teixeira said . after the second at bat , i told kevin i ca n't really swing right now . i was worthless to the team right there . i said we have to get it looked at . teixeira was pulled after two at bats saturday and flew back to be examined by a team###doctor sunday . he said he had felt fine during his first week after coming off the disabled###list on may , and he even had 3 home###runs with 12 r.b.i . in his first 12 games . but after playing 19 games in 20 days , including a rehabilitation###assignment with class###aa trenton , teixeira said the soreness was natural . that 's probably just too much , teixeira said . we learned that the hard way . teixeira made a point to credit long for noticing a hitch in his mechanics during the series in oakland last week , prompting teixeira to take extra swings off the tee before the game in anaheim . after blasting three homers in his first seven games , teixeira 's pop had quieted , and long recognized his follow through was not right . but teixeira had not done tee work before that afternoon , concerned about overworking the wrist too early after being activated . we tried it , teixeira said . now we have to take a step back .
as a rookie coach with a championship caliber roster , jason###kidd already had a lot riding on his maiden###season on the nets' bench . his stake in their success is about to get a little bigger . kidd is in the process of purchasing a tiny share of the franchise from the rapper###jay###z , according to two people with knowledge of the transaction . the sale was first reported by the new york post , which pegged the value at , 000 . does this make kidd his own boss , immune to dismissal and empowered to give himself a raise ? not exactly . kidd is purchasing half of jay z 's share , which itself is quite small just a fraction of a percent , according to estimates . the dual role , as head###coach and minority###owner , is rare but has precedent . pat###riley was given a 10 percent###ownership share in the miami###heat upon being named###head###coach and team president in . the n.b.a . has no rules against such an arrangement . the league does bar anyone from serving as a player agent while holding any official role with a team . jay z moved to divest his share in the nets after announcing his intention last spring to represent professional###athletes , including n.b.a . players , through his newly###created roc###nation sports agency . jay z 's first client was robinson cano . he has since signed kevin###durant . jay z 's ownership###stake in the nets was nominal , but his imprint was profound . he was a guiding###force in the creation of their new logo and black and white color###scheme , and a key###figure in the nets' push to relocate to brooklyn , where he grew up . he played eight shows to open the 1 billion barclays###center last fall . his courtside presence , with his wife , beyonc , gave the nets an air of credibility , and a sheen of cool . kidd 's purchase provides a neat bit of symmetry . it was kidd , then a nets point###guard , who in 2003 suggested to jay z that he buy a share of the franchise .
i didn't get an offer of an extra 500 in credits for various airline charge reimbursements from american###express on my american###express platinum card . i was n't offered , either . neither were many readers who contacted me after last week 's column reporting that american###express is dropping a major perk of its 450 a year platinum card as of march , 2014 free entry into airport lounges operated by the now merged american###airlines and us airways . but i also heard from readers such as jeffrey rosenbaum , who received an offer of an extra 500 in credit on his platinum card a card on which he said he charges well over six figures a year . and i heard from others , such as nestor ruiz , who received a 200 extra###credit . mr . rosenbaum , incidentally , said that he valued his platinum card not just for lounge access but for other benefits , like the ability to use reward points for flights on various airlines , rather than on a single one . i recently transferred american###express points to air###france and can fly nonstop round###trip from l.a . to paris , he said . trying to calm the commotion over the loss of the american us air lounge benefits on its 450 a year platinum card , american###express has been emailing selected cardholders with make good offers of extra credits next year . but as word spreads about the selective nature of these offers , i wonder if american###express failed to anticipate blowback from those who got nothing , and who were already evaluating whether the platinum card is still worth 450 a year . these offers are targeted to select card members based on a number of factors that i 'm not allowed to share , melanie l . backs , a spokeswoman for american###express , said in an email response . she did not return phone calls seeking further comment . american###airlines is ending free lounge access to platinum card###holders because of its complex partnership with citigroup , which issues a line of aadvantage credit###cards , branded with the airline 's mileage program . effective march , citi recently###announced , its extravagantly named citi executive aadvantage world###elite mastercard ( also at 450 a year , will be the only card in the united###states offering###free access to american###airlines lounges . american###express and its platinum card were shown the door . the perplexed responses to the loss of a major platinum perk underscores the complications , and the cutthroat competition , in these credit###cards . billions###of###dollars a year ride on the presumption that frequent travelers will pay###fees , whether 50 a year , or , or more , for a card that provides perks ranging from priority boarding and a free checked bag , to lounge access and international mileage awards in pampering business###class cabins . brian###kelly publishes thepointsguy . com , which seeks to impose order on the bewildering world of travel award points and credit###cards . many travelers pay for the platinum card because they do the math , and its various benefits add up to more than 450 a year in value , he noted . but with the loss of the american lounge access , that math may not quite add up in 2014 for some cardholders . there are other cards out there that might give you more value , with lower fees , offering , say , big sign up bonuses , he said . i always think a consumer should sit back at times like this when you 're thrown a curveball and actually assess , if you 're not able to make it to that 450 a year in value , there are other cards out there with various offers and bonuses to factor in . i recently got an american###airlines aadvantage mastercard that costs 95 a year , with a bonus of , 000 miles on american . but next year , having pocketed those miles , i 'll probably cancel that card when renewal time comes . that 's the way the game is played but it can get complicated . for example , the american###express premier rewards gold card , which costs 175 a year , provides three times the reward points as the platinum card . while the premier rewards gold does n't come with all the bells and whistles of the platinum card , you could be reaping in hundreds of dollars of value more a year just in extra miles , mr . kelly said . american###express is now offering that card with the first year fee dropped , and a bonus of , 000 points . but that offer is not available to current platinum card###holders . the platinum card still offers benefits that can hit more than 450 a year for many travelers . there 's the standard 200 credit toward airline fees , and 100 toward enrollment in global entry . and the card still provides free entry to delta###air###lines' extensive network of sky club lounges in the united###states and abroad . it also provides membership in priority pass , with access to hundreds of international###airport lounges , including some in the united###states though not those operated by united###airlines ( or , starting in march , american and us airways . ) meanwhile , as i noted last week , american###express is providing platinum cardholders with free access to two luxurious centurion lounges it opened this year at the las###vegas and dallas fort###worth airports . leases have been signed for centurion lounges at san###francisco and la###guardia airports , and the company plans a wider network after that . but since these upscale lounges are branded under the name of the american###express exclusive , invitation only centurion card ( which costs , 500 a year , can lowly platinum card###holders expect that free access to continue ? our intention is to keep this an embedded benefit for platinum card members as we roll out new lounges , ms . backs said .
englewood , colo . wade###phillips would like to put an asterisk on peyton###manning 's touchdown record . the houston###texans' interim###coach said friday the league agreed with him that manning 's record###tying 50th td toss sunday should n't have counted because eric###decker bobbled the ball . the touchdown still counts , however , as does manning 's 51 st td throw . that one to julius thomas minutes later capped denver 's 37 13 win and broke tom###brady 's record of 50 td passes set in . that football , along with manning 's grass stained no . 18 jersey and his cleats , were sent to the pro###football###hall###of###fame in canton , ohio . decker said phillips should just let it go , telling the associated press on friday , i caught it . this does n't###change anything . it 's still a big catch for me and one i 'll###remember for a while . same with manning , who told decker after the reception with 57 left , great catch , man ! decker 's 20 yard###reception with 57 left in the fourth###quarter gave denver a 30 13 lead , and the td was upheld on replay , much to the chagrin of phillips , who felt decker did n't have control of the ball until after his momentum carried him out of the back of the end###zone . phillips sent the play to the league this week , contending the wrong call was made . we did get some good news . actually , it 's bad###news for peyton###manning because the league did come back and say that the ball was juggled by decker and should n't have been a touchdown , phillips said at the beginning of his friday news conference . he jokingly added , i guess they 're going to have to take that hall of fame ball that they sent to the hall of fame back . i feel###bad for peyton celebrating breaking the record and it really did n't###happen . i guess they still count it , do n't they ? anyway , the league came and said that it was not a touchdown . unfortunately , they ruled it a touchdown on the field and then they reviewed and said it was a touchdown . but now the league came back and said it was n't , which we said all along . broncos coach###john###fox shrugged off phillips' comments , noting there 's been plenty more td passes that manning has had this season that were overturned on replay . i 'm on the other side of a lot of those too but it really does n't###change anything . so i 'll just leave it at that , fox said at his friday news conference . later , fox told the ap there was one play in particular , against tennessee on dec . 8 , in which decker caught a pass and rolled into the end###zone for the apparent score but he was ruled down shy of the goal###line upon further review . tv replays , however , do n't clearly show a defender touching him before he rolls across the goal###line . i still thought that was a touchdown , but i do n't###pay much mind to all that stuff because it does n't###change anything , fox said . i do n't really put much stock in all that . decker said he still does n't think he was touched on that play , but those kinds of calls all even out in the end . as for phillips checking with the nfl on his record###tying td catch , decker added obviously , coaches want the games to be called fair . he did n't think it was the right call , which i thought it was . so , he 's going to voice it to the league . but it still counts .
wimbledon , england there are many ways to count how long marion###bartoli waited for her first grand###slam###title . this year 's wimbledon was her 47th major tournament . she reached her first grand###slam###final here six years###ago but did not play another until saturday . she had not won a tournament since october . bartoli , 28 , counted it in hours hours of dreams since she was , when she was taught the game by her father , walter , who was her coach until earlier this year . for a tennis###player , you start to play like at 5 or 6 years old , she said . when you decide to turn pro , your dream is to win a grand###slam . you dream about it every day . you think about every day . so when it happens , when it actually happens , you feel like , you know , you achieve something that you dream about for maybe millions of hours . the wait ended saturday when bartoli defeated sabine###lisicki , 6 1 , 6 4 , in 81 minutes to win wimbledon . in a tournament marked by upsets and injuries , it seemed appropriate that the champion was such an unusual player , one called quirky and eccentric for her on court routines and her tennis upbringing . i 've never been afraid of being special , never , bartoli said . i think it 's kind of boring to be like everyone . bartoli is the first player , female or male , to win wimbledon playing two handed on both sides . at a stocky 5 feet 7 inches , she is dwarfed by amazons who dominate the game . the no . 15 seed , she is only the third player seeded outside the top 10 to win wimbledon in the open era . she learned to play on a modest court , with a sometimes leaky roof , in the small###town of retournac , france , with her father , a doctor , her only coach . she often practiced from 10 p.m . until midnight so her training would not interfere with her schooling . she said her training made her as strong as wood . bartoli said the final would be a battle of nerves , and she won that in a rout . before her semifinal against kirsten###flipkens , she took a 30 minute nap . before the final , she was singing and dancing in the locker###room . lisicki , the 23 year old no . 23 seed from germany , was in her first grand###slam###final , and it seemed both players were nervous at the start . bartoli double faulted to give lisicki a break in the first game , but lisicki gave it right back . lisicki also double faulted on break###point , with a terrible toss on her second serve , a problem throughout the match . it was the beginning of an erratic performance by lisicki , who had won the hearts of the crowds after her upset of no . 1 serena###williams in the fourth###round . lisicki was broken two more times in losing the first set , badly overhitting ground strokes and unable to control her serve , her biggest weapon . bartoli was laser focused and hitting laser shots . she was strong at the net and quick and creative at the baseline . she said she overheard compliments from billie###jean###king , who was sitting in the royal box . she was turning to the person next to her 'did you see that shot ? did you see this one ? ' bartoli said . i was like , yeah , billie###jean , you see i can play some great tennis . lisicki had been in holes before , down a break in the third set against williams and against agnieszka radwanska in the semifinals . the centre court crowd tried to rouse her as she took the opening game of the second set . but bartoli would not let lisicki into the match . she saved four break###points in the second game of the set , then broke lisicki in the next one . lisicki 's emotions got the better of her . serving at , she laughed after another bad toss . but after two double faults , lisicki was in tears , covering her face with her racket . bartoli broke her again to go up by . i was a bit sad that i could n't###perform the way i can , lisicki said . lisicki started to come back , saving three match###points and breaking bartoli to get to . but the second time bartoli served for the championship , she did not let it go , holding at love and closing with an ace . i played some shots out of the blue that i never tried even in practice , and finishing by an ace , for me , that is beyond amazing , said bartoli , who is not known for her serve .
from biology class to c.s.i. , we are told again and again that our genome is at the heart of our identity . read the sequences in the chromosomes of a single cell , and learn everything about a person 's genetic information or , as 23andme , a prominent genetic###testing company , says on its web###site , the more you know about your dna , the more you know about yourself . but scientists are discovering that to a surprising degree we contain genetic multitudes . not long###ago , researchers had thought it was rare for the cells in a single healthy person to differ genetically in a significant way . but scientists are finding that it 's quite common for an individual to have multiple genomes . some people , for example , have groups of cells with mutations that are not found in the rest of the body . some have genomes that came from other people . there have been whispers in the matrix about this for years , even decades , but only in a very hypothetical sense , said alexander urban , a geneticist at stanford###university . even three years###ago , suggesting that there was widespread genetic###variation in a single body would have been met with skepticism , he said . you would have just run against the wall . but a series of recent papers by dr . urban and others has demonstrated that those whispers were not just hypothetical . the variation in the genomes found in a single person is too large to be ignored . we now know it 's there , dr . urban said . now we 're mapping this new continent . dr . james r . lupski , a leading expert on the human###genome at baylor###college###of###medicine , wrote in a recent review in the journal science that the existence of multiple genomes in an individual could have a tremendous impact on the practice of medicine . it 's changed the way i think , he said in an interview . scientists are finding links from multiple genomes to certain rare###diseases , and now they 're beginning to investigate genetic variations to shed light on more common disorders . science 's changing view is also raising###questions about how forensic scientists should use dna evidence to identify people . it 's also posing challenges for genetic counselors , who ca n't assume that the genetic information from one cell can tell them about the dna throughout a person 's body . when an egg and sperm combine their dna , the genome they produce contains all the necessary information for building a new human . as the egg divides to form an embryo , it produces new copies of that original genome . for decades , geneticists have explored how an embryo can use the instructions in a single genome to develop muscles , nerves and the many other parts of the human body . they also use sequencing to understand genetic variations that can raise the risk of certain diseases . genetic counselors can look at the results of genetic screenings to help patients and their families cope with these diseases altering their diet , for example , if they lack a gene for a crucial enzyme . the cost of sequencing an entire###genome has fallen so drastically in the past 20 years now a few thousand###dollars , down from an estimated 3 billion for the public###private###partnership that sequenced the first human###genome that doctors are beginning to sequence the entire genomes of some patients . ( sequencing can be done in as little as 50 hours . ) and they 're identifying links between mutations and diseases that have never been seen before . yet all these powerful tests are based on the assumption that , inside our body , a genome is a genome is a genome . scientists believed that they could look at the genome from cells taken in a cheek swab and be able to learn about the genomes of cells in the brain or the liver or anywhere else in the body . in the mid 1900s , scientists began to get clues that this was not always true . in , for example , a british woman donated a pint of blood . it turned out that some of her blood was type o and some was type a . the scientists who studied her concluded that she had acquired some of her blood from her twin###brother in the womb , including his genomes in his blood cells . chimerism , as such conditions came to be known , seemed for many years to be a rarity . but it can be commoner than we realized , said dr . linda randolph , a pediatrician at children 's hospital in los###angeles who is an author of a review of chimerism published in the american journal of medical###genetics in july . twins can end up with a mixed supply of blood when they get nutrients in the womb through the same set of blood###vessels . in other cases , two fertilized###eggs may fuse together . these so called embryonic chimeras may go through life blissfully unaware of their origins . one woman discovered she was a chimera as late as age . in need of a kidney###transplant , she was tested so that she might find a match . the results indicated that she was not the mother of two of her three biological###children . it turned out that she had originated from two genomes . one genome gave rise to her blood and some of her eggs other eggs carried a separate genome . women can also gain genomes from their children . after a baby is born , it may leave some fetal cells behind in its mother 's body , where they can travel to different organs and be absorbed into those tissues . it 's pretty likely that any woman who has been pregnant is a chimera , dr . randolph said . everywhere you look
mike###glennon threw a 1 yard touchdown pass to tackle donald penn and led a long fourth###quarter touchdown drive to put the host tampa###bay###buccaneers ahead for good in a 22 19 victory over the embattled miami###dolphins on monday###night . bobby rainey 's 1 yard run capped an 80 yard drive , and the buccaneers held on in the final 10 minutes to become the last team in the league to win this season . playing for the first time since a bullying scandal , the dolphins ( 4 5 ) started###slowly before overcoming an early 15 0 deficit to lead 19 15 heading into the fourth###quarter . ryan###tannehill threw touchdown passes of 6 and 19 yards to rishard matthews , but got no help from a running###game that was limited to just 2 yards###rushing . at a news conference before the game , the miami###dolphins' owner , stephen ross , broke his silence on the bullying crisis that has engulfed his team , saying that he was appalled by jonathan martin 's allegations of daily harassment by teammates . ross said he was in touch with martin by text and planned to meet with him on wednesday at an undisclosed###location . speaking before a game between the dolphins and the tampa###bay###buccaneers , ross promised to get to the bottom of the allegations and create a locker###room culture that suits the 21 st century . it could n't have been a worse nightmare , said ross , who was joined at a news conference by tom garfinkel , the team 's president and chief###executive###officer . the n.f.l . is investigating whether offensive###lineman richie###incognito harassed martin and whether the dolphins mishandled the matter . martin left the team two weeks###ago , and incognito was suspended soon after . ross said he still had the utmost confidence in coach joe###philbin . joe###philbin is probably one of the most organized people i 've ever met , ross said . when i interviewed him , that stood out , but what also stood out was his character . i do n't think there is a better person , a more respected person , a more caring person in the national###football###league than joe###philbin . but ross said changes needed to be made in the organization . manning's ankle o.k . denver quarterback peyton###manning , whose tender right ankle suffered another blow late in sunday 's victory over san###diego , will play this weekend against undefeated kansas###city after tests found no further damage . he 'll definitely play , the interim###coach jack###del###rio said . he 's ready to roll , and that 's good news . manning was left limping after the chargers' corey liuget dove at his ankles in the closing###minutes of the broncos' 28 20 win . del###rio said the broncos had sent replays of the hit to n.f.l . offices for review . in the rules , there are certain areas you can hit and certain areas that are supposed to be protected , del###rio said . and we thought that got into an area that was supposed to be protected . manning had four touchdown passes against the chargers to bring his total to 33 on the season tied with tom###brady for most through nine games . manning was sacked twice by the chargers and hit five other times . he has been sacked 12 times in the seven games since chris###clark replaced the injured ryan###clady at left###tackle . tillman and cutler hurt if the chicago###bears make a playoff###run , it will be without cornerback charles###tillman and possibly quarterback jay###cutler . josh###mccown will start sunday against the baltimore###ravens in place of cutler , who left the bears' 21 19 loss to the detroit###lions with a high left ankle###sprain . cutler is listed as week to week . tillman , a two time pro###bowler , suffered a torn right triceps muscle in the second half sunday , and he has been placed on the injured###reserve###list , designated to return . he would be eligible to play again in eight weeks . the bears ( 5 4 ) have seven games remaining in the regular###season . vikings receiver apologizes minnesota wide###receiver jerome simpson apologized for the attention he brought the team after his arrest on suspicion of drunken driving . coach leslie###frazier was uncertain about simpson 's availability for sunday 's game in seattle . the n.f.l . is reviewing simpson 's arrest early saturday on a highway heading out of downtown minneapolis . the league suspended him for three games last year for violating the league 's substance###abuse policy . titans lose locker tennessee quarterback jake###locker will miss the rest of the season with a lisfranc injury to his right foot that may need surgery . ryan###fitzpatrick will start at quarterback when the titans host indianapolis on thursday . cleveland linebacker out browns outside linebacker quentin groves was placed on injured###reserve and will miss the rest of the season . groves will have surgery on his left ankle .
jason###kidd would have been wise to pay closer attention to the clich those who can , do those who ca n't , teach . a phenomenally talented point###guard , kidd , with leadership and uncanny court vision , elevated the overall skill of every team he played on from high###school to the n.b.a. , taking also rans and making them contenders . his most impressive turnaround came when he joined the hapless new jersey nets in , transforming the team into eastern###conference###champions . in his new role as coach of the brooklyn###nets , though , kidd 's midas touch has thus far eluded him . he has seemed lost while presiding over a 5 14 start for a team that expected big###things with its all star laden roster . the season got off to a bad###start when kidd was suspended for the first two games after his guilty###plea to a drunken driving charge that was leveled against him last year . but last week , the wheels started to come off . kidd reassigned lawrence###frank , his former coach and one of his top assistants , because of a personality conflict , and thursday he watched as the team was blown out at home by the struggling knicks . as the knicks stormed to a 30 point victory in a brooklyn arena packed with fans of the opposing###team , one nets fan sat in section 15 wearing a replica brooklyn jersey emblazoned with kidd 's no . 5 . he had customized it with the help of masking###tape and a marker to read re assign coach kidd . the notion that kidd , whose retired jersey is in the barclays###center rafters , could be on the hot###seat so soon may seem far fetched . but kidd could find himself pushed out by a demanding owner who has committed to winning now the team is paying a record luxury tax penalty because of its veteran heavy payroll , and the roster was built partly by trading the team 's first###round###draft###picks in the next five drafts . it is not hard to imagine that if kidd were fired midway through his first season . such a catastrophic###failure would result in his deciding that coaching simply is not for him . there is precedent for such an occurrence , with 15 previous n.b.a . coaches being fired during their first seasons , and subsequently never coaching again . the quickest hook came for carl bennett , the coach of the 1948 49 fort###wayne###pistons , who made it through six games . his record was 0 6 and the team 's hall of fame owner , fred zollner , thought bennett might be a better fit in the front office . the instinct proved###correct . a year later bennett was an integral part of the merger of pro###leagues that created the n.b.a . later , bennett was one of the driving###forces to break the game 's color###line . the two most recent coaches to be fired after less than one season , without coaching again , were the hall of fame college coach jerry###tarkanian , who proved to be a bad fit for the 1992 93 spurs , and randy ayers , who was fired 52 games into the 2003 4 season by the philadelphia 76ers with a record of . the general###manager who fired ayers was billy king , who now runs the nets . perhaps the best comparison to kidd , however , in terms of a player being asked to coach the team for which he once starred , is george###mikan , who coached the minneapolis###lakers in . whereas kidd was brought in a season after retiring to coach a team that had recently###moved , mikan , a hall of fame center , went back to his former team two seasons after retirement in hope of preventing relocation . with the team desperate to build revenue , the lakers could not be patient with mikan and he was fired after 39 games with a record of . three years later , the team moved###to###los###angeles . things###happen in sports , mikan told###reporters at the time of his firing . when a team is not winning , someone must suffer . it is impossible to tell how much wiggle room kidd may have as the nets look to justify the team 's immense payroll . but should he end up being shown the door , he could benefit from the perspective hank soar showed years after being fired by the providence steam###rollers just 19 games into the 1947 48 season . we had a 2 17 record when i was fired in midseason , soar recalled . but my successor was , so i think the problem might have been the players and not the coaching .
detroit general###motors , the nation 's biggest automaker , said on thursday that its net###income fell 19 percent in the second quarter , mostly because of a sharp###drop in pretax profit in asia . g.m . said it earned . 2 billion in the quarter , compared with . 49 billion in the same period a year ago , although it narrowed its losses considerably in europe , where weak economic###conditions have driven new car sales to their lowest###levels since the 1990s . the company said that its global revenue rose 4 percent , to . 1 billion , and that worldwide###sales , including joint###ventures , increased 4 percent to . 49 million vehicles . while g.m . 's north###american business improved , the company has been dogged by persistent problems in its overseas###operations . europe has been its biggest trouble spot , but weaker results in asia and south###america have additionally kept g.m . from posting broad improvements . still , g.m . 's chief###executive , daniel f . akerson , said on thursday that g.m . had steadily rebuilt its operations since its bankruptcy and government bailout in . g.m . is an inherently stronger company than it was even a year ago , mr . akerson said in a conference call with analysts . most analysts said the company beat its expectations for the quarter , but had yet to achieve consistent###performance around the world . the global results were mixed , matt###stover , an analyst with guggenheim securities , said in a research note . europe , north###america and g.m . financial posted better than expected###results while international###operations came in lower . in north###america , g.m . benefited from new products , particularly pickups , and steadily improving demand by consumers for new vehicles to replace aging models . the company said it earned . 97 billion in pretax income in the region in the quarter , a###4 percent gain from . 89 billion a year ago . its pretax loss in europe was 110 million , which was considerably better than its loss of 394 million in the same period a year ago . mr . akerson said there was more progress to come in europe , where g.m. , with its struggling opel brand , has lost money for more than a decade . the company has revamped its european management team with outside hiring and has stepped up the introductions of new products in the region . we 're going to continue to push in europe , mr . akerson said . we 're going to play offense and defense , and focus on continuing to take costs out of the business . the major surprise was g.m . 's declining performance in asia . the company said it earned a pretax profit of 228 million in the region , a 63 percent###decrease from 627 million a year ago . while g.m . continued to grow in china , it faced increased###competition and pricing pressures from japanese competitors in other asian###markets as well as australia . the company 's chief###financial###officer , daniel ammann , said g.m . also experienced larger than usual warranty costs and vehicle recalls in the region . in south###america , g.m . earned a pretax profit of 54 million , compared with 16 million a year ago . analysts contend that g.m . needs to accelerate its development of global vehicle platforms that yield a variety of different models . the company is also trying to increase the presence of its two best known american brands , chevrolet and cadillac , in other parts of the world . g.m . increased vehicle###sales in every region other than europe , where sales fell about 7 percent in the quarter . its global market###share slipped , to . 5 percent , compared with . 6 percent in the second quarter of . the company 's share of the north###american market dropped to . 3 percent from . 4 percent last year , and its share in europe dropped to . 5 percent from . 8 percent . mr . akerson said the company continued to work on reducing###costs . g.m . recently###created a new business services unit , which is intended to consolidate back office systems and streamline operations . but he declined to reveal specific###targets for cost cuts . and the company is adding employees rather than shedding them . g.m . said it had increased its global employment about 3 percent , to , 000 workers , compared with year ago levels .

mason , ohio maria###sharapova 's return to wta###tournament play after more than a month away was short lived following an upset###loss to 17th ranked american sloane###stephens , 7 6 ( 5 ) , 6 3 in the second round of the western###southern###open on tuesday . in a match that lasted 2 hours , 22 minutes , stephens overcame losing the first set and the first two games of the second and double faults on two match###points to pick up her first victory over sharapova in four meetings . it definitely started out rough , stephens said . a set and , she was killing it . i 'm glad i was able to turn it around and start playing good tennis . sharapova , the 2011 w s champion and a 2010 finalist , showed no traces of the hip###injury that had kept her sidelined since a second round loss at wimbledon . i thought i started the match off pretty well , but when you put yourself in a really good position , you ca n't let it go , sharapova said . that 's what i did tonight . i did n't###continue what i was doing well for the first set and a half , and that hurt me . you know , i stopped being patient . i started###making a lot more errors , especially off the first ball just errors that i should n't make . obviously i have n't played in a long time , but i ca n't make that excuse for myself because i 've got to be ready from the first match . so it 's obviously disappointing , but that 's the way it goes in this game . jimmy###connors , who won the tournament 41 years###ago , watched from the stands in his first match as sharapova 's coach . she hired connors , the 1972 champion and a 1986 finalist , in mid###july . fourteenth seeded jelena jankovic , the 2009 champion and 2011 runner up , advanced to the second round with a , 5 7 , 6 2 win over wimbledon finalist sabine lisiski . defending men 's champion and fifth seeded roger###federer advanced to the third round with a , 7 6 ( 7 ) win over 29th ranked philipp###kohlschreiber . it was just really important to play somewhat of a clean match , said federer , who already has won a record five w s championships and improved to 7 0 in his career against kohlschreiber . straight###sets is always a good match . it 's a good win for me . in earlier action , second ranked victoria###azarenka held off an upset bid by qualifier vania###king to pull out a , 7 6 ( 6 ) win and advance to the third round . azarenka rallied from a 3 0 hole in the second set to force the tiebreaker against the 140th ranked american . azarenka , who has been bothered by a lower back injury , won her first match since losing to samantha###stosur in the finals of the southern###california open two weeks###ago . i think the beginning of the second set was n't very good for me , azarenka said . there were quite a few unforced###errors and just really fast mistakes , which did n't###happen in the first set . varvara lepchenko of the united###states advanced with a , 2 6 , 6 2 win over flavia###pennetta , and jamie hampton needed three sets to overcome anastasia pavlyuchenkova , 4 6 , 6 3 . sorana cirstea , the 21 st ranked romanian who lost to no . 1 serena###williams in the finals of the rogers###cup in toronto on sunday , withdrew from her first round###match against yanina###wickmayer . cirstea was replaced by no . 43 monica###niculescu , who lost in this past weekend 's qualifying but stayed around in case a spot opened up in the singles###main###draw and to play doubles . the romanian capitalized on her second chance with a , 6 2 win over the 58th ranked wickmayer . no . 10 seed###caroline###wozniacki easily advanced with a , 6 1 win over shuai peng . gilles###simon was forced###to###retire because of a strained hip against vasek###pospisil , who was leading , 1 1 .
at the giants' camp on sunday , there was some off season housecleaning to finish like addressing the recent arrest of one player and the suspension of another . before practice , linebacker dan connor explained how he was arrested and charged with possession of an offensive weapon after bringing a switchblade through airport###security in philadelphia earlier this month . safety will hill said his four game suspension , imposed by the n.f.l . on july , was for his repeated use of marijuana . connor , a 27 year old free###agent signed by the giants in march after four seasons in carolina and one in dallas , said i was flying to a friend 's wedding , and i had a pocketknife in my bag that i did n't even know about . i had n't seen it in over a year , so i was a little shocked when they pulled it out . connor , who is one of several new giants competing for three open linebacker spots , said he packed all of his belongings in dallas in march and drove to new jersey with his wife . the spring###loaded knife , which connor said he had thought he had lost , was in a toiletries bag that he had with him as he prepared to board a flight from philadelphia to pittsburgh . the knife was discovered by a luggage screening device . it 's just unfortunate , but you know , at the same time , it 's my fault and i 've got to prove to everyone that i 'm not that type of guy , connor said . i 'm not the type of guy to get in trouble . that was the first time i had been arrested , so it was definitely pretty embarrassing for me . hill , a second year player signed by the giants as a free###agent , said he smoked###marijuana to handle the stress of living and growing up in a rough section of east###orange , n.j. , where he said he was recently held up at gunpoint . i was going through a lot of stressful times last season , and i failed a lot of drug tests , said hill , who played 12 games for the giants last year . in the environment i grew up in , just walking down the street and having people put guns in your face , it 's stressful . you really do n't know how to deal with situations like that . hill , 23 , said the giants helped him enter a rehabilitation###clinic in boston this spring . he has continued with regular outpatient therapy . i know right versus wrong , hill said . the giants helped me the best way they could . they got me help and helped me see other ways to cope with my problems . i do n't###fight it anymore . i 've###met a lot of people and made a lot of friends . a couple therapists that are on my team have helped me out with situations . i 'm learning and staying with it . hill was suspended for four games in 2012 for using a performance###enhancing substance he blamed the prescription use of adderall . he said he was not suspended last year for his marijuana use because he and the giants were negotiating with the league and setting up his treatment###plan . but just before training###camp opened last week , the n.f.l . decided on a four game ban for his marijuana use , hill said . hill is allowed to practice with the giants , and he said he thought he would still make the team . i think i 'll be around , he said . the giants have told me to stay positive and keep moving###forward , just do n't have any missteps . coach tom###coughlin on sunday would not comment on whether hill would make the team , but said , hopefully , will 's going to get his life straightened out . shortly after catching a long sideline pass while sprinting at top speed , wide###receiver hakeem###nicks stopped practicing sunday . afterward , tom###coughlin said that nicks had tightness in a groin muscle . nicks was not limping after the play and jogged lightly back down the field . the giants' medical###personnel examined nicks , and then he watched from the sideline for the remainder of practice . nicks , a free###agent at the end of the season , played through foot and knee injuries in .
as dusk settled over augusta###national###golf###club in january , john peterson prepared to play the famous par 3 12th hole , the most photographed golf real###estate in the world . the moment was overwhelming , so he backed away from the ball . there was no one there except me and my caddie , peterson , 23 , said . probably around 30 in the evening . it was the most beautiful sight i 'd ever seen . if there 's golf in heaven , it probably looks like that right there . i could not believe where i was , honestly . peterson has no clear memory of how he played the hole because it was a practice round and he allowed himself to play a few balls into the green . like all the players who have qualified or been invited to play in the masters , peterson is allowed to play augusta national whenever he likes , so he took advantage of the opportunity . but unlike any player who will tee up a ball thursday or any golfer who has played in the masters before him peterson is a full time player on the pga###tour 's second tier of competition , known as the web . com tour . while pga###tour golfers were at tournaments in southern###california , arizona and florida , peterson 's season began in places like panama , colombia and chile , where he earned about , 000 . his biggest payday was the , 750 he won for finishing 10th at the chitimacha###louisiana###open last month . peterson , who moved to fort###worth from baton###rouge , la . , when he was a child , was the n.c.a.a . champion at louisiana###state in . he is ranked 18th on the web . com money list , and he hopes to finish in the top , which would allow him to play on the pga###tour next season . another way for peterson to earn a spot on the big tour is to win the masters or the united###states open , which he will also play . that might seem far fetched for someone who , in his words , is just beginning to learn how to play golf out of a hotel###room . but the way peterson won his spot in the masters showed he had a flair for the dramatic . there was only one way for him to get into the masters as a full time player on the web . com tour , said david###peterson , john 's father . and , by gosh , he did it . with about 90 players , the masters has the smallest field of any of the four majors , but it also has the most ways in . to know all of them would require an encyclopedic###knowledge of the tournament or a cheat sheet . on masters . com , under the heading qualification for invitation , there are 19 ways to earn an invitation to the tournament . there are traditional spots for the amateur champions of the united###states , britain and asia . there are honorary spots for past###champions . there are international players invited by the masters committee . other routes to augusta involve money lists and rankings . next to the name of each player in the field , there is a number or several numbers in parentheses , referring to the way the golfer gained###entry . alongside peterson 's name is a solitary , indicating that peterson qualified for the masters by finishing in the top eight of last june 's united###states open . peterson played his way into the open###field through sectional qualifiers in tennessee and ohio and then finished###tied with four others for fourth###place at the olympic###club in san###francisco . peterson shot , for a total of three over par . that 's pretty much the type of player john is , said louisiana###state coach chuck winstead , who has been peterson 's swing coach for the past 12 years . he 's a very straight driver of the ball , and i 've been telling him for years , a tournament like the u.s . open would be well suited to his game . he 's a player who usually has very clean scorecards . in the open , his first major , peterson was in contention all four days , but with one more stroke he would have fallen from the top eight and would not be playing at the masters . he remembered perfectly the shot that made the difference . i was starting to leak oil on saturday , said peterson , who was paired in the third round with david###toms , another former l.s.u . player and a friend and mentor . i was four over on the day , but on the 13th hole a 181 yard par 3 i hit the greatest shot of my life a 7 iron that landed on the front of the green , rolled right up and died in the hole like a long putt . it was peterson 's first hole in one . as the crowd roared , he attempted a chest bump with his caddie , high fived toms and embraced his father , who had stormed under the ropes to join the celebration . i was screaming my brains out , david###peterson said . i had to give him a high five and celebrate with him . with my loud mouth , security knew i must have been the dad . john peterson said , the ace left me numb for a good five minutes . it also got him back on track . even as he saw his title hopes fade on sunday , he knew what a top eight finish meant . i stood over my first putt on the 18th green knowing a two putt would get me in the masters , peterson said . i was nervous on that first putt but left it a foot short . i tapped in and started looking for my dad . it was father 's day . that was cool . so instead of playing in the wnb golf classic in midland , tex . , on the web . com tour next week , peterson will be joined by his father , mother , grandfather , two brothers and sister in augusta . he knows no first time participant in the masters has been fitted for a green###jacket since fuzzy###zoeller in , but peterson said he believed he had the game to make a run . ball striking is the strength of my game , and that means a lot of fairways and greens , peterson said . when i played augusta in january , i liked how my game fit there . i liked that the course demands precision . i ca n't###wait to get back .

when tom###clements , the head of colorado 's prison system , was shot to death at his front door last month , the killing seemed a planned assassination by a white###supremacist gang . the authorities in texas said they were looking into the possibility that the suspect , evan s . ebel , might also have been involved in the fatal shooting of a kaufman###county prosecutor in january . reports linked mr . ebel , who according to prison records had a swastika tattoo on his abdomen and white pride inked on his arms , to the 211 crew , a white###supremacist gang that has about , 000 members in colorado 's prisons . but weeks after mr . clements 's killing , investigators are still trying to sort out whether the death was in fact a gang ordered hit or the act of a lone###gunman whose years in solitary###confinement may have nurtured paranoia and a hatred of prison officials . james f . austin , a consultant who helped mr . clements in efforts to make significant changes in colorado 's prisons , including reducing the use of solitary###confinement , said it was unprecedented for a prison###gang to take aim at a public###official . this has just never happened before in the history of corrections , dr . austin said . what would be the value of the gang doing that , except to bring incredible heat both on and off the street ? he added that the gangs like to do their thing without much attention , especially with a director who is doing everything he could to make the prison safer and more comfortable . dr . austin said that mr . ebel , whom he described as kind of a lone wolf , had been released directly to the streets after almost six years in solitary###confinement . mr . clements had been seeking to introduce transitional programs for inmates who had been held in isolation for long###periods . but law###enforcement officials said on thursday that they could not rule out the possibility that mr . ebel who died after he was wounded in a shootout and a chase with texas police###officers and sheriff 's deputies northwest of dallas on march 21 was acting on orders from the leaders of the 211 crew . a search is continuing for two members of the gang known to have had contact with mr . ebel recently , said lt . jeff kramer , a spokesman for the el###paso county###sheriff 's office in colorado . he called the men , james lohr , 47 , and thomas guolee , 31 , persons of interest but stopped###short of saying they were suspects in the case . both are also wanted on warrants for unrelated crimes , lieutenant kramer said , and are thought to be armed and dangerous . two one one is still very much on the table , lieutenant kramer said . the only thing we have ruled out is that this was random . underscoring that point , a former corrections officer said thursday that after mr . clements 's killing , prison###officials warned officers not to wear their uniforms to and from work because of concerns that the gang might target them . the former officer did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation . from the beginning , untangling the motives behind mr . clements 's killing has been laced with complexities . less than two weeks after he was killed , a second kaufman###county prosecutor was shot to death in texas , stirring more speculation about ties to white###supremacist gangs . the district###attorney 's office had been involved in an investigation of the aryan###brotherhood of texas prison###gang . but since then , the authorities have broadened the investigation to include other possible theories . experts on hate###groups who track the activities of prison###gangs said that the 211 crew was not known to have any connections to the aryan###brotherhood or other white###supremacist groups in other states . mark potok , a senior###fellow at the southern###poverty###law###center , described the gang as a pretty serious crew but said that any actions the group was known to have taken were completely within the state of colorado . the 211 crew , founded in the mid 1990s by benjamin davis , an inmate currently serving a 108 year term in prison for a 2007 racketeering conviction , has earned its reputation for ruthless violence and proved its capacity for murder . in , two of the gang 's members carried out a notorious racially motivated killing , shooting a senegalese immigrant at a bus###stop in denver . mr . davis appealed his sentence but his prison term was reaffirmed on wednesday .
paris to beat back the british , the united###states davis###cup team is prepared to get dirty . john###isner , the highest###ranked american man at no . 16 , said team members and their captain , jim###courier , had been discussing hosting their february davis###cup match against britain on clay , a surface that american players in recent generations had considered kryptonite . the united###states has not hosted a davis###cup series on clay since , a streak of 28 home series played on hardcourts , grass or carpet . there 's a bit of a chain email going on between captain courier , myself , sam and the bryan brothers , said isner , referring to sam querrey , mike###bryan and bob###bryan . we 've brought that up . i , for one , would actually like that . recent top american men , including pete###sampras , andy###roddick , james###blake and mardy###fish , have been at their least comfortable on clay , which has made it a natural choice for european and south###american###countries that host the american squad . but the 6 foot 10 inch isner , who prefers slower , higher bouncing surfaces , said the current american lineup , which features four players taller than , was suited for clay###court play . we 're not a typical tennis team , he said . we look more like a basketball###team . isner won his first clay###court title last april in houston he had reached the final of two other clay###court events . querrey has also won a title on clay , beating isner in a final in belgrade in . the bryans have played some of their best tennis on clay , winning 21 titles on the surface , including the french###open twice . clay is also by far the weakest surface for the british team . andy###murray has made it to 42 singles finals in his career , but none on clay . other probable singles players for britain like daniel###evans and james###ward play on the surface sparingly . you 've sort of got to take murray out of the equation , said isner , who lost , 6 7 ( 5 ) , 6 1 , 6 2 , to novak###djokovic in the third round of the paris masters on thursday . you know he 's going to be tough on any surface . and then you sort of go from there . isner led the americans to the davis###cup semifinals through heroics on foreign soil in , beating roger###federer on indoor clay in switzerland and jo###wilfried###tsonga on outdoor clay in france . isner added that he and the bryans also prefer to play outdoors , but choices for hosting an outdoor###event in february would be limited . isner mentioned the tennis rich###regions of florida , southern###california and arizona . another option would be hawaii , which would be a geographically convenient place for players to travel to after the australian###open , which immediately precedes the first round of davis###cup . tim###curry , director of communications for the united###states###tennis###association , said that the host city for the event , which will be held jan . 31 through feb . 2 , would be announced tuesday .
boston martin j . walsh , who grew up as the son of irish###immigrants in a triple###decker in dorchester , will be the next mayor of boston . buoyed by support from organized###labor , mr . walsh , 46 , a state representative , defeated city###councilman john r . connolly , 40 , on tuesday in a hard fought but relatively civil race that went down to the wire . with 100 percent of precincts reporting , mr . walsh won 52 percent and mr . connolly 48 percent . this is unbelievable ! mr . walsh said , noting that he had just accepted congratulations from president###obama . my parents had big###dreams for their kids , but i 'm not sure it was this big . in conceding the race , mr . connolly said of mr . walsh he wants to do good things for boston , and he will do good things for boston , and he has my full support . both candidates are progressive###democrats who faced off in a nonpartisan election to succeed mayor thomas m . menino , the city 's longest###serving mayor , who chose not to seek an unprecedented sixth###term after being slowed by various health problems . except for mr . menino , who is italian###american , boston has elected an unbroken string of irish###american mayors going back to the 1930s mr . walsh returns the city to that norm , and some of his relatives came over from ireland on monday###night to lend their support . the son of a laborer , mr . walsh overcame cancer as a boy and struggled###with###alcoholism as a young###man before winning a seat as a state###legislator in he has been sober for more than 18 years . he also worked in construction , rising through the ranks of laborers local 223 to become head of the building and construction trades###council of the metropolitan district . mr . walsh has overcome long odds to be where he is , said jeffrey m . berry , a political###scientist at tufts###university . this is the story of overcoming cancer and alcoholism and the story of the school###of###hard###knocks versus harvard , he said , referring to mr . connolly 's alma###mater . this is a story of redemption . in addition to his union support , mr . walsh benefited from the vocal endorsements of three prominent black and latino candidates who were among those who lost in the preliminary###election for mayor in september , when mr . walsh emerged at the head of a pack of 12 hopefuls . analysts said that the early support from these three charlotte golar richie , felix arroyo and john barros turned the tide , giving mr . walsh credibility in their neighborhoods as they rallied their supporters behind him . mr . walsh pledged to invest in the city 's poorer neighborhoods , appoint half of his cabinet from communities of color and change the complexion of the police department to more closely###reflect the diversity of boston . mr . walsh also has a personal warmth and a down to earth quality that many voters said they found appealing . i feel like i could go knock on his door and say what i needed to say , said mary###lee marra , 60 , who teaches nursing and lives in hyde###park . and he would listen to me . detroit mike duggan , a former hospital executive who campaigned with the backing of detroit 's business###leaders , was elected###mayor on tuesday in a race overshadowed by the protracted###legal###battle over the future of the fiscally devastated city . in defeating the wayne county###sheriff , benny napoleon , mr . duggan becomes detroit 's first white mayor in four decades and will preside over a city that is more than 80 percent black . detroit 's turnaround will not occur until every detroiter is involved in this effort , said mr . duggan to a cheering ballroom of supporters , adding , we need everybody to pull together . the vote was one of the few opportunities residents may get to influence the near future of detroit , which is 18 billion in debt and embroiled in a bankruptcy trial in federal court . if the city enters a chapter 9 reorganization , it would be the largest###municipal bankruptcy in america . mr . duggan 's victory comes as the city is being run largely by kevyn d . orr , a washington bankruptcy lawyer appointed as emergency manager by gov . rick###snyder , a republican . dave###bing , the current mayor , declined to run again , and has expressed###frustration at a lack of say in day to day operations , raising###questions about what influence the next mayor would have under state oversight . mr . duggan , who is credited with restoring the detroit###medical###center to fiscal health , beat mr . napoleon and more than a dozen other black candidates in an august primary###election , despite having to run as a write###in###candidate after he was removed from the ballot over a residency challenge . drawing strong###support from detroit 's business###interests , he campaigned on the message that his turnaround experience of leading the struggling hospital would persuade state officials to remove mr . orr sooner . houston mayor annise d . parker , a democrat , won a third and final two year term tuesday###night . houston became the largest###city in the united###states to elect an openly###gay###mayor when she first won office in december . she has led the city through a kind of renaissance as it enjoys a robust economy and a thriving arts and restaurant scene . it won the top spot last year on the forbes list of america 's coolest cities to live . but ms . parker has her share of critics and faced a crowded field of eight opponents . her main challenger , ben###hall , a former city###attorney who is black ,

annandale on hudson , n.y . while igor###stravinsky successfully###cultivated the air of a rootless###cosmopolitan during his long stretch as the 20th century 's most renowned###composer , modern###scholarship has firmly###established his links to a broader tradition of russian music and the debt many of his works owe to his culture and forebears . but with that facet of his multifarious career having been summarily addressed during the first weekend of this year 's bard music###festival , there was plenty more to cover during three more jam###packed days and nights . the second weekend 's agenda picked up chronologically where the first left off stravinsky asserting his place among a heady avant###garde milieu in paris between the world###wars , when a widespread rejection of romanticism and wagnerian heft was in the air . friday 's program , against interpretation and expression the aesthetics of mechanization , emphasized works created during this period of new objectivity , as it was termed in weimar###germany , when romanticism was eschewed for a confluence of neo###classical lucidity , mechanical rigidity , the sharp angles of african###art and american jazz , and sardonic cheek . considering all this , stravinsky 's madrid written for mechanical pianola but presented in a two pianos version by stravinsky 's son soulima was perhaps too blithe and evocative to represent the evening 's thesis . the sonata for two pianos , despite its formal rigor , had a similarly breezy aspect . the concerto for piano and winds played by peter###serkin with an ensemble of professional and student players conducted by leon###botstein had a chillier modernist glint bach with smallpox , as prokofiev uncharitably described it . between those works came bartok 's atmospheric sonata for two pianos and percussion hindemith 's puckish kleine kammermusik and var###se 's fervid octandre . the sharpest contrast was between two adjacent piano works messiaen 's hyper rigorous mode de valeurs et d'intensit s , splendidly executed by gilles vonsattel , and george###antheil 's unwittingly condescending sonata sauvage , thunderously dispatched by piers###lane . stravinsky in paris , on saturday###afternoon , offered his tender cinq doigts , refined duo concertant and spirited octet for wind###instruments , interspersed with pieces by fellow expatriates , like the polish composer alexandre###tansman 's temperamentally gallic sonatina for flute and piano , and the czech composer bohuslav martinu 's dense , rustic string###quartet no . 4 . albert###roussel 's s r nade , for flute , harp and string###trio , offered a taste of authentic french lushness and finery . the sonata for violin and double###bass by arthur louri , a neglected russian composer who served as stravinsky 's personal###assistant and spokesman , bore the impression of stravinsky 's style . the standout performance was a compelling rendition of prokofiev 's sonata for two violins , lent an arresting vigor by jesse mills and harumi rhodes . on saturday###evening , the scene shifted to the united###states , where stravinsky lived from 1939 until . settling in southern###california , he was surrounded by fellow european migr s . the program , which featured mr . botstein and the american###symphony###orchestra , included stravinsky 's rumbustious 1941 reharmonization of the star###spangled###banner , his elegant ballet jeu de cartes , elegiac ode ( 1943 ) and severe , majestic requiem canticles . an example of stravinsky 's idiosyncratic embrace of 12 tone composition , requiem canticles benefited from ardent performances by the mezzo###soprano rebecca ringle , the bass###baritone john relyea and the bard festival chorale , whose work here and throughout the festival was exemplary . paradoxically , schoenberg , the father of serialism , fashioned a rapprochement with conventional tonality in his somber , dramatic kol nidrei , potently narrated here by erik contzius . and hanns###eisler , a stravinsky associate whose radical###politics saw him expelled from the united###states in , brought to his score for alain###resnais 's 1955 holocaust documentary , night and fog , a neutrality almost untenable to modern listeners accustomed to more emotionally suasive scoring . the film was shown during the performance beforehand , mr . botstein invited###audience members whose sensibilities might be offended by the documentary 's shocking concentration###camp images to leave . ( a small###portion did . ) the chorale had a program of its own on sunday###morning conducted by james bagwell . stravinsky , spirituality , and the choral tradition included a trio of short stravinsky pieces pater###noster and ave###maria , redolent of russian###orthodox tradition , and the serial anthem the dove descending breaks the air among contemporary###works by poulenc and krenek , and influential pieces by monteverdi , gesualdo and bach . stravinsky 's influence among american###composers and thinkers , assured by his delivery of lectures at harvard###university in 1939 and , was the subject of the sunday###afternoon chamber###music program . bracketed by his uproarious circus polka ( in a solo###piano arrangement winningly played by reiko aizawa ) and taut , playful septet were pieces by admirers like elliott###carter , walter###piston and aaron###copland . ellis kohs , a piston student , was represented by his stylish sonatina for violin and piano , a 1948 work that stravinsky urged his concertizing partner , the violinist samuel dushkin , to commission proof that stravinsky was not ungenerous with his influence . outstripping everything for profundity and heft was copland 's nonet , a dusky , pungent 1960 work for strings that should be better known . the festival 's grand###finale presented stravinsky 's mythological epics persephone and oedipus###rex . a preconcert lecture by tamara levitz , the festival 's scholar in residence , illuminated contradictory objectives among stravinsky and his chief collaborators on persephone , the actress ida rubenstein , who commissioned the work , and the writer andr###gide , who provided the libretto . formative frictions aside , the account was seamless and ravishing , with striking performances by the tenor sean panikkar and the narrator jean stilwell . grander still , oedipus###rex benefited from lucid narration by the actress kathleen###chalfant , stormy exhortations by mr . relyea and the larger than life presence of jennifer###larmore as jocasta . the soloists gordon gietz , david baldwin and william###ferguson sang valiantly . the director douglas fitch , making his bard debut , provided both works with deft , economical stage designs and evocative animated titles projected overhead . what resulted was an estimable triumph for mr . botstein and all involved .
federal officials will hold a town###hall###meeting on the spirit###lake indian###reservation in north###dakota this month to discuss the reservation 's child###sexual###abuse problem , which last year led the federal###government to take over the tribe 's social###services program . residents have complained that the bureau###of###indian###affairs and federal###prosecutors have done too little to stop child###abuse , which officials acknowledge is commonplace on spirit###lake and has reached###epidemic levels , whistle###blowers say . north###dakota 's senators and a representative are expected to attend the meeting . the federal###government took over the tribe 's social###services in october , and in one month federal officials said they had investigated more than 100 cases of reported child###abuse . more recent figures are not available , according to the bureau###of###indian###affairs . in may , a 9 year old girl and her 6 year old brother were killed on the reservation after being raped and sodomized . in recent###months , residents have protested outside tribal headquarters about the lack of prosecutions of those accused of child###abuse , and what they say is a continuing failure to protect spirit###lake 's children . the reservation 's registered child sex###offender list###includes the man who plays santa###claus at tribal events , as well as a brother of roger yankton sr . , the tribal###chairman . mark little owl , 34 , the official hired by the tribe to oversee its social###services , was arrested in december on several charges , including domestic###violence , after he punched a woman in the face , the authorities said . he was also charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor after throwing a child out of a bedroom where the assault was taking###place , according to court documents . the town###hall###meeting , announced by senators john###hoeven , a republican , and heidi###heitkamp , a democrat , and representative kevin###cramer , a republican , will include an update from the bureau###of###indian###affairs on federal efforts , according to a news release . a date for the meeting has not yet been set . we have pressed them not only to use every legal and administrative measure in their jurisdiction to ensure the safety of children on the spirit###lake reservation , but also to be transparent and forthcoming with tribal members about what they 're doing , the lawmakers said in a statement . the bureau###of###indian###affairs said that among the changes it has made since taking over tribal social###services was imposing a rule that required all adults who live with foster###children to have their fingerprints taken . while fingerprinting in such circumstances is already mandated by federal law , it was not being done regularly at spirit###lake , officials said . reservation residents say they believe significant###numbers of foster###children on the reservation have been sexually###abused .
upon securing the final out of the eighth###inning on sept . 26 , mariano###rivera retreated to the training###room inside the clubhouse at yankee###stadium , descending into a temporary sanctuary hidden from the , 675 fans who had come to say goodbye to him . as he applied heat to his aching elbow , coaxing it to allow him to throw the baseball just a few more times , two decades of memories washed over him the minor###league days when he struggled to understand###english his first few years as a yankee the early###successes and painful failures the all star games the five championships and a record 652 saves and all the relationships with teammates , coaches , clubhouse attendants and friends he had forged along the way . i was being bombarded with emotions and feelings , rivera said . but after a few moments of quiet reflection , he was ready to go back to the mound to say goodbye . even he did n't know how wrenching this farewell would be . for while rivera was collecting himself in the clubhouse , manager joe###girardi had a thought . instead of allowing rivera to complete one final save , and instead of removing him from the game himself , girardi decided to send andy###pettitte and derek###jeter , rivera 's longtime teammates , to the mound to escort him from the field one final time . after rivera recorded the first two outs in the ninth , jeter and pettitte emerged from the dugout and walked together to the mound . pettitte tapped his right arm as a manager would , summoning the ever so rare replacement for rivera , who , at first , smiled sheepishly . when they arrived at the mound , rivera handed over the ball . he wrapped his arms around pettitte , buried his face in his friend 's shoulder and wept almost uncontrollably . after 19 years , a magnificent career was over . he broke down and gave me a bear###hug , and i bear hugged him back , pettitte said . i mean , he was really crying . he was weeping , and i could feel him crying on me . with thousands grasping the magnitude of the moment , rivera regained his composure , hugged jeter and left the field . standing in front of the yankees' dugout , he took off his cap and waved one last time to the fans , who never stopped cheering , never stopped###loving . this is as good as it gets , girardi said afterward through his own flowing tears , and it 's probably as special a going out for any player i 've ever seen .
palm###beach###gardens , fla . the cold###wind that buffeted the honda###classic left a trail of debris . it creased the shiny image of the world no . 1 , rory###mcilroy , who abruptly gave up the defense of his title in the middle of the second round . it whipped tiger###woods , the world no . 2 , like a pin flag . by sunday 's conclusion , the leader board was so topsy###turvy that it produced a winner who had finished dead last in the field in his previous start . michael###thompson closed with a one under , one of only five sub 70 rounds recorded sunday on pga national 's champions course , to seal a two stroke victory over geoff###ogilvy . thompson finished at minus , a startling improvement over his 16 over par performance two weeks###ago at the northern###trust###open outside los###angeles , the highest###score among those who completed two rounds . the northern###trust was a good thing in my life , thompson said . it allowed me to focus on what i needed to do to play like i did this week . the missed cut was thompson 's third in four starts . with two months of the shortened 2013 season gone , he had made , 919 , which was not enough to cover his expenses . upon returning to his home in birmingham , ala . , thompson spoke with his wife , rachel , and his longtime swing coach , susan berdoy meyers . he shared with them his worst fear that he would n't make another cut this year and would lose his pga###tour playing privileges . they helped him to see that if his worst fate was to play golf next year on the web . com tour , he still had an enviable life . asked what led to thompson 's turnabout , his wife said i do n't know other than him being completely at the bottom and being utterly broken down , and feeling like he had nothing going for him and just being able to focus on enjoying the game again and practicing and feeling like he was playing for himself and the passion he has for golf , rather than trying to please people and everyone around him . there is maybe a lesson for mcilroy in the story of thompson 's turnaround . mcilroy 's friends say he is putting too much pressure on himself to prove to the world that he is worthy of the megamillion dollar deal he signed this year with nike . in an interview with nbc , jack###nicklaus , an 18 time major champion and someone whose counsel mcilroy has sought in the past , described mcilroy 's withdrawal as unfortunate and said , if he had thought about it for five minutes , he would n't have done it . nicklaus added , he 's a good kid he 's a sharp kid and i just think he is so frustrated with what is happening and the way he has played for the last month or so that it just got to him . thompson 's first tour victory overshadowed other resurgent performances . there was erik compton , a two time heart###transplant recipient who closed with a 70 to tie for fourth , his first top 10 finish in 61 tour starts . and ogilvy , whose finish earned a spot in this week 's world###golf###championships event at doral , outside miami , and put him back in the mix for a masters invitation . ogilvy , playing in the penultimate group , narrowly###missed an eagle putt at 18 that would have turned up the pressure on thompson , 27 , who got up and down from a greenside bunker for a birdie to make his victory more emphatic . before that , he had par putts lip out on 16 and rim in on . today i did a really good job of not thinking about all the things that happen after a win or after i get done playing , thompson said . i just kept telling myself , even on the last hole , just stick to what you 've been working on . summing up the conditions , thompson said it was a united###states open course with a british###open wind . in other words , it was a stage tailor made for him . in 57 previous###tour starts as a pro , his best finish was a tie for second last year at the united###states open at the olympic###club in san###francisco . michael plays really difficult golf###courses well , berdoy meyers said by telephone from arizona , because he knows he does n't have to hit it perfect . i think when he tries to be too perfect is when he puts too much pressure on himself . woods 's goal coming into the day was to apply###pressure on the leaders by posting a low number , like his 62 in the fourth###round last year . he had to settle for a 74 that included a lost ball , two water balls , a three putt and an eagle . when thompson emerged from the scoring trailer , a tournament official was waiting to lead him to the award###ceremony on the 18th green . thompson made him wait while he signed golf###balls and distributed them to each volunteer and security officer who had walked with him during the round . even after the triumphant end , he would not let anybody take him out of his routine , would not get ahead of himself and think of all the things that happen after a win .
with ominous daggers of lightning on the weather###channel 's web###site , dark###clouds scudding across the sky and rumors of cloudbursts in the vicinity , most people at the united###states open cannot help but obsess about teflon flaps covering the main stadium and the reassuring plock plock plock of tennis being played . dryness is still three or four years away , but the biggest player at the open so far is neither male nor female , champion nor upstart , but rather the retractable###roof promised by 2016 or . i do n't know how much difference it makes to the players , andy###murray , the defending###champion , said of the proposed roof after winning his match sunday . there 's 128 players in the draw . it will help , 15 players , but it does n't help everybody . then murray added but for the tournament , it 's great . it 's great for tv . it 's great for people that have tickets to come and watch , as well . and it means also that the tournament , you know , most likely will get finished on time . nothing wrong with any of that . after a seeming monsoon age caused the men 's final to be postponed to a highly anticlimactic monday in each of the past five years , people carped why ca n't the open be like wimbledon and the australian###open , which have roofs , or at least the french###open , which has plans for one ? then , like a bolt from the blue , the united###states###tennis###association announced on aug . 15 that it now had a plan for a retractable###roof over bulky arthur###ashe###stadium and another over the future louis###armstrong stadium , perhaps in . rafael###nadal of spain said last week that it is not normal , finishing a tournament on monday . it is nice , he said , to finish a tournament on a sunday . nadal 's opinion is correct . monday should be ceded to american###football . everybody wishes the ashe roof were here right now to avoid the ludicrous scene last wednesday when just about all tennis stopped while directly across roosevelt###avenue the mets and phillies pitched and batted in a sprinkle . the slightest spritz from the sky can stop tennis , and mess with the tortured minds of players , who live nomadic lives and are used to long stupefying delays in airports , hotels and locker###rooms . we were checking the radar a little bit before the match and it did look like we had a couple of hours of dry , said bob###bryan , after he and his twin , mike , rallied for a three set doubles victory sunday in the first match of the day in ashe stadium . nobody wants to be cooped up for hours . juan###mart###n del potro can empathize . we 've been at the locker###room preparing the match like three , four times a day , then the rains coming again , del potro of argentina said wednesday after his match , originally###scheduled for the day session , finally###concluded after 4 hours 13 minutes , and deep into the evening . sloane###stephens , the american who had a nice run here before hitting the brick wall named serena###williams on sunday , recalled her ordeal wednesday literally , every 10 minutes they kept saying 'if murray plays long , we 'll move you . if it rains , we wo n't . ' i 'm like , 'oh , my god , it 's horrible , ' stephens said . i never started that late . it was definitely a long experience . but i played good . maybe i should do that more often . what was the toughest challenge in waiting ? finding something to do , stephens said . her solution ? i warmed up . i ate . i looked on instagram , trying to figure out what picture i was going to post tomorrow . i literally had nothing to do . i was on my phone talking to my mom . random stuff . with a tropical###storm , hurricanes and showers affecting the last five tournaments , fans began to feel like canaries in the coal###mine the first victims of some new danger . last year , danny zausner , the chief###operating###officer of the billie###jean###king###national###tennis###center , asked compuweather to look into the u.s.t.a . 's long held premise that late###august###and###early###september are a relatively dry time in queens . the fact is , the open , formerly an amateur event known as the nationals , has had its share of delays over the decades , some of them epic . the u.s.t.a . devotes three full pages of its media guide to delays , including the hurricane that roared across long###island into connecticut in 1938 and killed more than 500 people . tennis resumed six days later , with the finals played on sept . 24 . is the weather getting more damp this time of year ? could five straight###men 's finals on mondays be blamed on humankind 's energy burning machines ? the answer from compuweather was , the weeks of , 8 26 , 9 3 and 9 10 are the 20th , 13th , 11th and 16th driest weeks of the year ( respectively ) according to the 1981 2010 climate average . that said , the data does support some high precipitation amounts during a few weeks in the recent###years of , 2010 and . the report stresses that a wide variability in precipitation can take place from year to year . the study###concluded at the moment the past few years would be considered an anomaly based on the limited data sample to support an increase in the normal amount of precipitation for future years . though it may not be a tangible product of global###warming , the rain has still shown the u.s.t.a . was belatedly pursuing a retractable###roof after failing to do so when ashe stadium was built for the 1997 open . the huge stadium is four times the size of centre court at wimbledon , partly to accommodate two tiers of dead###zone luxury###boxes , and cannot bear a roof because of the weight of the stadium . the problem is that the flushing###meadows area is a salt###marsh , later used as a municipal dump made famous as the valley of ashes in fitzgerald 's the great###gatsby . ashe is built on pilings , 200 feet###deep , ultimately hitting bedrock . by , the u.s.t.a . was asking another firm to design a roof , but the original team that had designed ashe the rossetti architectural firm of southfield , mich . , and ahmad rahimian , the structural###engineer , chief###executive of wsp cantor seinuk of new york did not give up . they took it rather personally , zausner said , recalling how the two firms came back with proposals for an eight legged structure outside the stadium , which could bear a retractable###roof of heavy###duty teflon that is designed to last 30 years and withstand 99 mile per hour winds , and remain###closed in the winter to keep snow out . one little discovery to keep condensation from forming inside the teflon roof , the open will need air###conditioning , which will not score###points with the green lobby . but zausner said air###conditioning would only be needed when there is rain during the two week open and could be handled with portable generators . the two roofs will take care of , 90 percent of the fans , in zausner 's words . the attendance###figures are staggering a record day session attendance of , 120 on sunday . zausner says the future campus could handle as many as , 000 more paying###customers what with the two roofs a scary thought , but at least fans wo n't have to run for cover when it rains , the way they do now . the weather###forecast was showing jagged scattered lighting storms into tuesday . where is that roof when we may need it ?
imagine a wolf catching a frisbee a dozen times in a row , or leading police###officers to a stash of cocaine , or just sleeping peacefully next to you on your couch . it 's a stretch , to say the least . dogs may have evolved from wolves , but the minds of the two canines are profoundly different . dog brains , as i wrote last month in the new york times , have become exquisitely tuned to our own . scientists are now zeroing in on some of the genes that were crucial to the rewiring of dog brains . their results are fascinating , and not only because they can help us understand how dogs turned into man 's best friend . they may also teach us something about the evolution of our own brains some of the genes that evolved in dogs are the same ones that evolved in us . to trace the change in dog brains , scientists have first had to work out how dog###breeds are related to one another , and how they 're all related to wolves . ya ping zhang , a geneticist at the chinese###academy###of###sciences , has led an international###network of scientists who have compared pieces of dna from different canines . they 've come to the conclusion that wolves started their transformation into dogs in east###asia . those early dogs then spread to other parts of the world . many of the breeds we 're most familiar with , like german###shepherds and golden###retrievers , emerged only in the past few centuries . meanwhile , back in china , those early dogs lingered on for thousands of years . today , they 're known as chinese native dogs . the chinese native dogs live in rural###villages , helping humans to guard homes , dr . zhang explained in an e mail . dr . zhang and his colleagues see chinese native dogs as the key to better understanding how dogs evolved . recently , they sequenced the entire###genome of chinese native dogs and compared them with the genomes of asian wolves and modern breeds like german###shepherds . by comparing the mutations in the genomes , they 've been able to estimate when wolves and dogs diverged . as they reported on tuesday in the journal nature communications , they found that the split started , 000 years###ago . those early dogs would have encountered small###bands of hunter###gatherers . people did n't###settle in villages to farm in east###asia until about , 000 years###ago . after dogs split from wolves , their genes began to evolve in a new direction . dr . zhang and his colleagues were able to identify some of these evolving genes . a number of them , it turned out , are active in dog brains . ( dr . zhang and some of his colleagues published some of these results last week in the journal molecular###biology and evolution . ) some of the genes that evolved early in dog evolution are involved in smell or hearing . others are active in a region called the prefrontal###cortex , where mammals make decisions about how to behave . some genes are involved in growing connections between neurons . one gene , called slc6a , transports a neurotransmitter called serotonin into neurons . the results offer some tantalizing hints about how wolves first turned doglike . the conventional###view is that the hunter###gatherers go out and get a puppy , said chung i wu of the university of chicago , an author of the nature communications study . if humans actually did breed early dogs this way , then dogs would have descended from a very small###population . that 's not what dr . wu and his colleagues have found , though . instead , it appears that a large###population of wolves started lingering around humans perhaps scavenging the carcasses that hunters left behind . in this situation , aggressive wolves would have fared badly , because humans would kill them off . mellower wolves , by contrast , would thrive . if this notion turns out to be true , it means that we did n't domesticate wolves they domesticated themselves . slc6a4 may have played a crucial part in this change , because serotonin influences aggression . to test these ideas , dr . zhang and his colleagues are gathering dna from more dogs and wolves . they also hope to collaborate with cognitive scientists to see how variants of genes like slc6a4 affect the behavior of dogs today . their results may also help explain human###evolution , because dr . zhang and his colleagues found that some of the same genes that evolved in dog brains , such as slc6a , also experienced natural###selection in human###brains . humans have had to tame themselves , said adam boyko of cornell###university , one of dr . zhang 's collaborators on the molecular###biology and evolution study . the process is probably similar to dogs you have to tolerate the presence of others .
chicago aaron###rodgers is back leading the green###bay###packers and that could be bad###news for every other playoff###team . he returned from a broken###collarbone and is taking aim at a postseason run , even if it took one big pass to get there . rodgers fired a 48 yard touchdown to randall cobb in the final###minute , and the packers beat the chicago###bears 33 28 to capture the nfc###north championship on sunday . this is a special group of guys who 've been through a lot , rodgers said . it 's been a rollercoaster . back after missing seven games with a broken left collarbone , rodgers found a wide###open cobb on fourth and 8 to wipe out a one point###deficit with 38 seconds###left . green###bay will host san###francisco next weekend in the wild###card round . the bears had one final###drive , but jay###cutler 's deep pass to alshon###jeffery was intercepted by sam###shields on the final play . that gave the packers ( 8 7 1 ) their third straight division title and fifth postseason appearance in a row . it also kept the bears ( 8 8 ) out of the playoffs for the sixth time in seven years . things were n't looking great for the packers after chicago 's brandon###marshall spun away from tramon###williams in the end###zone on the first play of the fourth###quarter to make it . but green###bay answered with a touchdown drive . eddie###lacy ran in from the 6 after a 22 yard pass from rodgers to andrew###quarless went through safety chris conte 's hands , making it a one point game . then , on the winning drive , green###bay converted twice on fourth and 1 before rodgers eluded pressure and unleashed that winning pass to cobb . a block by john###kuhn on julius###peppers helped rodgers roll to the edge and find cobb by himself down the field . we had a blitz on , bears coach marc###trestman said . we lost an edge . aaron was able to get outside . once he got outside things###happen . when you 've got a zero blitz on things can happen . and we just lost coverage with our eyes in the backfield . for rodgers , it was a strong finish after a shaky###start , and it gave him some payback against the team that nearly ended his season . he was intercepted on the packers' first two possessions but threw for 318 yards and two touchdowns in his first appearance since he was injured in a loss to chicago on nov . 4 . cobb , in his first appearance since oct . 13 , caught just two passes but both were for touchdowns . to be in that moment at the end of the game and have that opportunity , it 's a blessing , cobb said . jordy###nelson had 161 yards receiving . james###starks ran for 88 yards . eddie###lacy aggravated his ankle###injury in the third quarter and finished with just . for the bears , their first season under marc###trestman ended the same way five of the previous six did under lovie###smith on the outside looking in at the playoffs . this loss is sure to spark memories of green###bay 's victory in the 2010 nfc###title game at soldier###field on the way to the super###bowl championship and fuel more questions about cutler 's ability to win big###games even though he played well . with a playoff###spot on the line and his contract set to expire , cutler threw for 226 yards with two touchdowns and an interception . he is now 1 9 against green###bay , including that conference###final and a loss with denver in . marshall guaranteed cutler will be back next season , and cutler said he 'd like to return . you 'd love to , cutler said . you ca n't predict the future , though . i 'm not really going to get into what 's going to happen . it always works out how it 's supposed to . matt###forte ran for 110 yards and two scores . he also had 47 yards receiving with a touchdown###catch . alshon###jeffery had 80 yards receiving , and brandon###marshall had . two unusual plays late in the first half turned a 7 3 deficit into a 13 7 advantage for the packers . green###bay had a first down at the chicago 17 when a sack and strip against rodgers by julius###peppers turned into a wild touchdown . jarrett boykin ran across the field , picked up the loose ball as play stopped . one thing , though the whistle never blew . with rodgers standing###nearby , boykin turned and headed 15 yards to the end###zone , and after a replay review , it stood . that stunned the crowd and gave the packers a 10 7 lead . green###bay caught another big###break on the bears' next possession when jeffery fumbled a pass at the chicago . morgan burnett picked up the ball and lateraled to shields , who returned it to the chicago . that led to a 27 yard###field###goal by mason###crosby to make it a six point game at the half . as for boykin 's fumble recovery , rodgers said it was one of the strangest plays he could recall . boykin finally###picked it up , i looked back at ( referee ) clete ( blakeman , he was looking at us so i think myself and everybody on the sideline

wimbledon , england sabine###lisicki , a 23 year old german , got up from lying on the centre court grass and said , i 'm so happy . then she broke into tears . it might not have made much sense , but then again , hardly anything about the 2013 version of wimbledon has . for a sport so dominated by a handful of players in recent###years , it is as if everyone agreed it was time for others to take the spotlight . rafael###nadal lost in the first round , roger###federer and maria###sharapova in the second , all to players ranked outside the top . on a single day last week , seven singles players retired or withdrew with injuries , three of them in the top . the beloved grass took a beating , attacked for being too slippery . even serena###williams was not safe . on monday , it was lisicki 's turn to make tennis fans say , who ? by eliminating williams , who was fresh off dominating the french###open and had a 34 match###winning###streak . nothing at this tournament , it seems , will unfold as expected . what 's next ? deep###fried twinkies replacing strawberries and cream at the concession stands ? this is the most unusual major i 've been a part of in the last 20 years , said mary joe fernandez , a television analyst and former american champion . she added it feels different this week for sure . today on manic###monday , with 16 men , 16 women going out there , not seeing a sharapova or a federer , it was strange . it was strange not to see them on the schedule . it was strange when you were watching the big courts , not to see them enter it . before the tournament began , williams was an overwhelming###favorite to win , and when no . 2 victoria###azarenka and no . 3 sharapova exited , williams became even more heavily###favored . but after she was beaten by the no . 23 seed lisicki , 6 2 , 1 6 , 6 4 , williams said , it 's not a shock . she repeated , she 's a great player , over and over to reporters to convince them that her loss was , in fact , not shocking . maybe we should not be shocked any more by what is happening at wimbledon . during its first week , the tournament had achieved some unusual milestones fewest top 10 men and women in the third round most retirements and withdrawals most players over 30 in the fourth###round no american men in the third round for the first time since . more surprising than the numbers were the images . on media day , normally an uneventful clich fest , sharapova aired out personal grievances with williams . on the first match on the first day on court no . 1 , azarenka 's left###leg slid sideways , twisting her knee . she won that match , but she could not play her next . on saturday , no . 8 juan###martin del potro 's left knee made a similarly ghastly bend . he won that match and advanced to the quarterfinals monday , saying he was still not 100 percent . williams , a five time champion here , was also made to look awkward and uncomfortable on grass by lisicki 's go for broke shotmaking . on one break###point for lisicki in the pivotal third set , williams even missed an overhead . it was lisicki who ended up lying on the grass in celebration after hitting a forehand winner on match###point . as an example of how quickly fortunes can change here , lisicki is now the favorite to win , with 3 to 1 odds . her odds were 150 to 1 before the tournament began . but at this tournament , being the favorite is probably the last thing a player wants . it does n't mean anything , especially here , said agnieszka radwanska , now the highest###seeded woman remaining , at no . 4 . so many weird scores . the good fortune even ran out for a fan###favorite . last monday , after the british teenager laura###robson upset no . 10 maria###kirilenko in the first round , the former british champion virginia###wade excitedly looked###forward to the possibility of a quarterfinal meeting between robson and williams . now , neither player is in the quarterfinals , with robson losing to kaia###kanepi of estonia , 7 6 ( 6 ) , 7 5 . instead of williams versus robson , it will be kanepi versus lisicki on tuesday .
washington deep###fried catfish served with a side of hush###puppies and coleslaw has been a regional###specialty for years and a cash###crop for states in the deep###south . now , catfish is at the heart of a dispute as the house and senate prepare to work out their differences on a new five year farm bill . the current bill expires on sept . 30 . at issue is a little known provision in the 2008 bill that established an office within the agriculture department to inspect catfish . but those inspection programs also exist at the food###and###drug###administration and the national###oceanic###and###atmospheric###administration at the commerce###department . the agriculture department has traditionally inspected meat and poultry while the f.d.a . has inspected all other foods , including seafood . since 2009 the agriculture department said that it has spent 20 million to set up the catfish inspection office , which has a staff of four . the department said that it expects to spend about 14 million a year to run it . the f.d.a . spends about , 000 a year on its existing office . despite the cost , the agriculture department has yet to inspect a single catfish . senator john###mccain , republican of arizona , said the program reeks of wasteful government spending intended to help one special interest group , and he has vowed to deep fry the catfish program . on monday , mr . mccain and senator jeanne###shaheen , democrat of new hampshire , sent a letter to senator debbie###stabenow , democrat of michigan and chairwoman of the senate agriculture committee , asking her to adopt language from the house farm bill that eliminates the additional inspection office . an amendment sponsored by the two senators to cut the program 's funding was not included in the senate 's most recent version of the farm bill . there is no reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing a duplicative catfish inspection###program that will cost millions to set up and another 15 million to operate annually , ms . shaheen said . eliminating this duplicative program is a matter of common###sense . catfish farmers and producers in mississippi say their support of a catfish inspection###program at the agriculture department is about food###safety and imported catfish . the f.d.a . is understaffed and little inspection is done of the fish that comes into this country , said dick stevens , the president and chief###executive of the consolidated catfish company in isola , miss . fish raised in other countries have been found to have drugs in them . we 're just saying everyone should be held to the same standard . but that argument has little sympathy outside of the catfish industry . a may 2012 government###accountability###office report called imported catfish a low###risk food and said an inspection###program at the agriculture department would not enhance the safety of catfish but would duplicate f.d.a . and commerce###department inspections at a cost to taxpayers . the g.a.o . said a food###safety law passed in 2010 would give the f.d.a . the resources it needed to adequately inspect foreign foods , including catfish . the obama administration has called for eliminating the agriculture department 's catfish inspection###program . most agriculture groups are also opposed to the agriculture department 's catfish inspection###program . groups including the american soybean association and the u.s . grains council signed on to a letter supporting repeal of the program . domestic catfish farmers have been hammered in recent###years by a combination of rising feed costs and competition from foreign producers , particularly vietnam and china . catfish farmers and producers say the industry has shrunk by about 60 percent since its peak a decade or so ago . in the past few years , 20 percent of the catfish farming###operations have closed , which producers attribute to the influx of foreign fish . the industry has tried to fight back . in , farmers and producers lobbied successfully for a law to prohibit fish from vietnam from being sold and marketed as catfish , unless it was from a species that was found only in the southern###united###states . but that did not stop the flow of fish imports . so , with backing from southern lawmakers , the industry fought for the 2008 provision in the farm bill that would subject catfish to a more rigorous inspection regimen than the one at the f.d.a . gavin gibbons , spokesman for the national fisheries institute , a trade group of seafood producers , including catfish farmers , called the inspection###program a backdoor trade restriction . what you have is a special interest group trying to use a food###safety scare as a trade###barrier , mr . gibbons said . it 's wholly inappropriate . but that has not been enough to sway southern lawmakers like senator thad###cochran , republican of mississippi . a staunch defender of the domestic catfish industry , mr . cochran was instrumental in getting the inspection provision in the 2008 farm bill . mississippi leads the nation in catfish production , and a research facility at mississippi###state###university dedicated to the study of catfish is the thad###cochran national warmwater aquaculture center .
new york minnesota manager ron###gardenhire is realistic . taking two out of three from the yankees for their first series win in new york in more than a decade is not going wipe out the twins' horrid first half . it sure feels good , though . aaron hicks hit a three run homer a pitch after shortstop eduardo nunez made a two out throwing###error , and minnesota took advantage of some yankees miscues and misfortune to beat cc###sabathia for the first time in six years , 10 4 sunday . you still have to live with the way we played in the first half and our record is not very good , gardenhire said , quickly adding guys are smiling and that 's what we want to see . justin###morneau had three hits two very well placed as minnesota won a series at yankee###stadium for the first time since taking a set at the old ballpark in . still , the twins are 9 31 here starting a year later . they 'd had even less success against sabathia , going 0 11 in 12 games including the postseason after beating him on july , 2007 . things went our way and that has n't###happened here in a long time , gardenhire said . the yankees made two errors that led to five unearned###runs . they also hit into four double plays two on baserunning blunders by zoilo almonte in making it plenty easy for the twins in the teams' final###game before the all star break . the fans let new york know their displeasure , booing relentlessly after the yankees fell behind 8 1 in the fourth . rookie kyle gibson ( 2 2 ) benefited from the sloppy play to earn his second win in four career###starts . he pitched five plus shaky innings , yielding three runs two earned on five hits and four walks . minnesota improved to 3 7 on a 10 game road trip and is . it 's been a terrible road trip , ryan###doumit said . it 's nice to win two out of three going into the break , give us a little bit of a momentum , especially two out of three against the yankees at their place is big for us . after the game , gardehire said the team is making three moves , sending outfielders oswaldo arcia and chris parmelee and infielder eduardo escobar to triple a rochester . they need to go swing , all of them do , said gardenhire , who emphasized all three are part of the club 's future . to take their spots , the twins will purchase the contract of infielder doug bernier and recall catcher chris herrmann from rochester . a third move will be made sometime before friday 's game against cleveland . new york goes into the break , good for fourth###place in the al###east . i think we just need to be more consistent , we got to stay out of stretches where we do n't###score runs , yankees manager joe###girardi said . we have to be more consistent offensively and if we do that , we 're going to have a shot . sabathia gave up a season high eight runs three earned and matched his low of four innings this year . lyle###overbay could n't###handle doumit 's two out hot###shot to first base with the bases###loaded in the fourth for an error to let in two runs to make it . the previous batter , morneau hit a popup in between the mound and second base that was just out of a lunging sabathia 's reach . sabathia slid on his knees after missing the ball as jamey###carroll scored . in the third , morneau , who came in batting . 128 against sabathia , hit a short fly to right that hit off second baseman robinson cano 's glove for a double . nunez made his error two batters later and hicks connected for a 5 0 lead . sabathia shouted and nunez took off his glove and held his hand on his hip as hicks rounded the bases with his eighth homer of the year . guys are going to make errors , sabathia said . it 's up to the pitcher to make pitches . in the first inning , almonte burst off first base on cano 's sharp liner to right and was doubled off to end the inning . the rookie tried tagging up on a routine fly to left###field in the third but was out at home by several feet . almonte reached on second baseman brian dozier 's fielding error and advanced on cano 's rbi single that made it 5 1 and a groundout . carroll in the lineup because he was 4 for 10 against sabathia and pedro florimon had rbi singles in the second . ichiro###suzuki , who had three hits , homered in the seventh to make it . dozier had an rbi double in the eighth and yankees catcher chris stewart 's passed###ball allowed one more in the ninth . notes cano had at least one rbi in all seven games against the twins this year . he had nine in a four game sweep at minnesota . ... girardi said andy###pettitte will start friday at boston in the first game after the break . he will be followed by hiroki###kuroda and sabathia . ... gardenhire set his post break rotation , too mike###pelfrey , kevin###correia , scott diamond and samuel deduno . ... girardi said injured ss derek###jeter ( quad strain ) will not be evaluated until thursday or friday . ... alex###rodriguez went 1 for 3 with a run###scoring double and two rbis for class a tampa , his first extra###base###hit during a minor###league rehabilitation###assignment . a rod is scheduled to join double a trenton for monday 's game at reading ,

rio de janeiro although his world###cup dream looks distant , ronaldinho is only one match away from joining a select###group of players who have won the european champions###league and the libertadores###cup , its south###american equivalent . the gifted 33 year old returned to brazil in january 2011 after a slump in his european career with two objectives to win a place in his country 's 2014 world###cup team and claim the club titles missing from his trophy cabinet . on wednesday , his atletico mineiro team will try to overturn a 2 0 first leg deficit in the second leg of the libertadores###cup final at home to olimpia of paraguay in belo###horizonte . having inspired barcelona to the champions###league crown in , ronaldinho hopes to join brazilians dida , cafu and roque junior and argentines carlos###tevez , walter###samuel and juan###pablo sorin as champions on the two continents . the match is ronaldinho 's best chance to ensure his return to brazilian football is not seen as a failure after a string of disappointments . flamengo brought the twice fifa###world###player###of the year back hoping the deal would have advantages on the field as well as marketing benefits off it , but the project sunk . ronaldinho spent a troubled 17 months at the rio club , where he suffered a loss of form blamed on his party lifestyle . in that time , flamengo only won the minor carioca ( rio ) state championship and ronaldinho left in may 2012 with the club owing him back wages . for brazil , with whom he won the world###cup in 2002 and also played at the 2006 finals , ronaldinho appears to have lost his best chance of impressing coach luiz###felipe###scolari and dropped out of the reckoning for next year 's home finals . thanks to good club performances , especially in the libertadores###cup , ronaldinho earned a recall in april for a friendly against chile at the mineirao , the newly###refurbished stadium in atletico 's home###city belo###horizonte . on top of a lacklustre performance in a 2 2 draw , ronaldinho was not forgiven by disciplinarian scolari for turning up late on the first day of training . you invite me to lunch at your home . i get to your house and you 're not there . i wait and you , the host , are the last to arrive . the national###team goes to the dining###table and the last one to arrive ? the host , that 's not right , brazilian###football###confederation ( cbf ) chief jose###maria marin said in a recent interview with globo network . ronaldinho was left out of brazil 's squad for the confederations###cup last month and is unlikely to find a place in a team that won the title crushing world###champions spain in the final . his talent , however , has never been in doubt and he hopes to shine in the libertadores###cup final . nothing is greater than the will to bring the title to the 'galo' , ronaldinho said on twitter using atletico 's nickname 'cockerel' .
every family has its traditions . researchers last week reported that neanderthals probably not only buried family members , but sometimes reproduced with them , too . happy###holidays , everyone . in a remarkable###feat of genetic extraction , scientists have reconstructed the entire###genome of a , 000 year old neanderthal from a single toe bone , yielding a bumper###crop of insights . the result , described in the journal nature , was said to be similar in quality to what scientists would achieve if they had sequenced the dna of a living neanderthal . analysis revealed that the toe , found in a cave in siberia , belonged to a female neanderthal who was highly inbred . the genome also contained evidence of more interbreeding among ancient human###populations than was previously known . nathan p . myhrvold , a former microsoft executive , and a dinosaur hobbyist and cookbook author , published an article in plos one alleging serious errors and inconsistencies in dinosaur research by top paleontologists . in the studies , skeletons were measured to calculate how quickly dinosaurs grew in one instance , researchers###concluded that the apatosaurus grew , 000 pounds in a year . the author of the original###research , gregory m . erickson , is standing behind his work , though some of his co authors agreed that the papers have errors that should be corrected . penguins and fire ants both display complex , tightly coordinated movements when acting as part of a group , according to new studies . fire ants form themselves into a single mass that can flow like liquid or resist pressure like a solid , depending on the situation . the findings , which could aid development of self building robots or self healing materials , were presented last month at a meeting of the american###physical###society . emperor penguins , on the other hand , maintain their tight huddles during antarctic winters by moving like cars in traffic , according to a study in the new journal of physics . if a single penguin moves as little as two centimeters in any direction , a wave of tiny movements ripples through the group , keeping everyone within a comfortable distance . deadly to bees , dangerous to usa class of pesticides linked to the deaths of honeybees might also be harmful to humans , and their use should be restricted , european food regulators said . several reports have blamed neonicotinoids , a relatively new class of pesticide , for aiding in the nearly decade long die off of honeybees . a new assessment has found that some neonicotinoids may affect the developing nervous system of children . bayer , which developed one of the popular insecticides in question , disputed the assessment . monday is weird thing in a jar day at the academy of natural###sciences of drexel###university in philadelphia . stop by for a closer look at some of the stranger specimens in the museum 's collection , and learn how scientists prepare them for study and storage . bring the kids , because you can even make your own weird thing in a jar to take home .
helena , mont . the trial of jordan johnson , a former starting###quarterback at the university of montana accused###of###raping an acquaintance , begins in missoula , mont . , on friday , extending a cloud of scandal that has hung over the campus for two years . mr . johnson faces one count of sexual###intercourse without consent and , if convicted , a sentence of anywhere from 2 to 4 years to 100 years in prison . mr . johnson , who has denied the accusation , would also have to register as a sex###offender for life . a series of accusations of sexual###assault and other crimes , many involving members of the university 's hugely###popular football###team , the grizzlies , have overshadowed the college###town of missoula , in the mountains of western montana . claims that accusations had been ignored , covered up or played down by university and law###enforcement officials also contributed . e mails released last year , for example , showed that one university official , james###foley , sought a way under the student conduct code to punish a woman who had publicly###claimed that she was sexually###assaulted by four members of the football###team . he also urged that officials stop calling the assault gang###rape and refer to it as date###rape . mr . foley has since moved to a different post . in mr . johnson 's case , the woman said that in february , mr . johnson raped her as they watched a movie together at a fellow student 's home , according to her affidavit . a report was made to the police in march 2012 and , after an investigation of several months , mr . johnson was charged in july . in the affidavit , reported in the missoulian , the city 's daily newspaper , the woman said that she sent a text###message to a friend shortly after the encounter omg ... i think i might have just gotten raped ... he kept pushing and pushing and i said no but he would n't###listen ... i just wanna cry ... omg , what do i do ! the next day she went to the university of montana student assault resource###center , and then to a medical###exam . mr . johnson 's lawyer , david paoli , has said the sex was consensual . he did not return a phone call seeking comment . the federal justice###department is investigating how the university has handled claims of sexual###assault . the department of education 's office###for###civil###rights is also investigating a sexual###harassment complaint against members of the football###team . and the n.c.a.a . is investigating the university on undisclosed matters . peggy kuhr , a university spokeswoman , said that while neither the n.c.a.a . nor the justice###department investigations had concluded , the controversy had prompted the university to make changes . we 've been working all along , moving###forward on campus safety , she said . among the changes is a mandatory online tutorial on the subject of sexual###assault that students must take and pass . the department of justice is also investigating how missoula###county prosecutors and the city police handled complaints of sexual###assault . in december , a student told the police that she had lost consciousness while drinking and woke to find herself under assault by five men , including four football players . none were charged . in december , three players were implicated in two other assaults and were not charged . city law###enforcement officials have said the allegations often involve alcohol , memories are hazy and it is very difficult to bring charges . in april of last year , the contracts of both the football###coach , robin pflugrad , and the athletic###director , jim o'day , were abruptly###terminated without explanation . mr . johnson 's trial comes on the heels of the sentencing of a former grizzlies running back , beau donaldson , who pleaded###guilty to raping a childhood###friend in 2010 as she slept in his apartment . last month , he was sentenced to 30 years in jail , with 20 suspended . he must serve two and half years before he is eligible###for###parole . we 've had sex assaults , vandalism , beatings by football players , said pat williams , a former congressman and a member of the montana board###of###regents . the university has recruited thugs for its football###team , and this thuggery has got to stop . university officials say they are trying . the recently###hired athletic###director , kent haslam , said one of the most important changes is that coaches are no longer in charge of players who violate a new , clearer student athlete code of conduct . instead , a violation is handled by a four person committee consisting of athletic officials , including the senior###women 's administrator . questions have been raised about whether mr . johnson can get a fair trial amid such controversy . court officials have assembled an extra large pool of 400 for the jury###selection that begins friday . you have to believe that the presumption###of###innocence is somehow affected , said milt datsopoulos , who represented mr . donaldson and is also on the national###advisory###board for grizzly athletics , a booster organization . he believes that his client 's sentence was more severe than it would have been had there not been what he called a toxic atmosphere in missoula . they made him a poster###child for a supposed major problem , mr . datsopoulos said of mr . donaldson . i do n't think a problem###exists .
washington the nationals began sunday with a ceremony honoring retiring manager davey###johnson . by the end of the night , their playoff###hopes were just about dashed . giancarlo###stanton and christian yelich homered to lift the miami###marlins to a###4 2 win in the opener of sunday 's day night doubleheader , a result that clinched playoff###berths for the atlanta###braves and st . louis###cardinals . washington gained a split by winning the nightcap 4 2 when wilson###ramos' ninth###inning grounder bounced off a leg of third baseman chris###coghlan for a game ending error that allowed pinch###runner eury perez to score . the nationals trail nl wild###card co leaders cincinnati and pittsburgh by five games with six to play . like i said before , i 'm not very good at math , but i 'm good enough to figure out that losing makes it tougher , washington 's ryan###zimmerman said between games . but we 've just got to keep playing and see what happens . rafael###soriano ( 3 3 ) pitched a scoreless ninth###inning to win washington 's regular###season home finale , and denard###span drove in three runs . jayson###werth doubled off sam dyson ( 0 2 ) leading off the ninth , and perez pinch ran and stole third with one out . coming back from right forearm tightness that had kept him off the mound since sept . 8 , stephen###strasburg allowed three runs and six hits in six innings and left with a###4 3 lead . stanton hit a tying double off tyler###clippard in the eighth . miami had been 0 8 at nationals###park this season coming in and starter tom###koehler ( 4 10 ) had been 0 4 in eight starts since aug . 1 . koehler allowed two runs and three hits in six innings of the opener , and steve###cishek pitched a perfect ninth for his 32nd save in 34 chances , completing a four hitter and a scoreless afternoon for the marlins' bullpen . you ca n't###score six , seven runs every game , zimmerman said ( koehler ) pitched well and they 've got some good arms in the back of their bullpen . cishek has converted 27 consecutive save chances , tied for the longest###streak in club history . you know it 's crazy . out there i had a little more adrenaline pumping . it felt like a playoff atmosphere , cishek said . the fans are really into it and those guys are digging in there and every at bat was huge for them . it felt good to come out and win a game like that . dan###haren ( 9 14 ) lost to miami for the third time this year , giving up three runs and eight hits in six innings . stanton 's 24th homer , a two run drive after yelich doubled , put the marlins ahead in the first . i know there 's a base open but it 's the first inning , haren said . i guess in hindsight i could have just walked him . i was n't trying to just challenge him , i was trying to get a good pitch down and away it just got a little too much plate . yelich added a solo shot in the third . koehler , who shut out the mets for eight innings while earning a no decision in his last start , limited washington to two singles over the first five innings . zimmerman homered in the sixth , his 26th of the season and 11th of september . i thought koehler did a nice job getting through the sixth###inning and gave up the one big###hit , but did exactly what we needed him to do , marlins manager mike###redmond said . we hit a few balls on the button , but right at somebody , johnson said . donovan solano drove in miami 's final run with a sacrifice###fly in the seventh . notes todd###jones saved 27 straight for the marlins in . . the ceremony honoring johnson included a pair of video tributes and the presentation of an engraved tiffany crystal keepsake . ... juan###pierre got his , 216th hit , moving###past joe###dimaggio for sole###possession of 175th place . ... stanton has hit###safely in 23 of 29 games at nationals###park with 13 home###runs . ... ian###desmond 's two stolen###bases in the night game gave him his second straight season with at least 20 homers and 20 stolen###bases .
as a lifelong believer in the sanctity of the great indoors , at least when it comes to movies , i have never been to a drive in or a rooftop screening . one typically balmy los###angeles night , some friends and i watched a movie projected on a parking###lot wall , but other than this adventure and a youthful stint###working for the filmmaker jon rubin whose floating cinema projected movies alfresco on pontoon boats that we guided into waterways unannounced , delighting and sometimes startling onshore campers i have spent most of my movie life inside . my idea of moviegoing bliss ca n't be found in a park or on a roof but in a theater , where most of the ambient light comes from the projector and the screen . one such theater was conceptualized by the avant###garde filmmaker peter kubelka , who called the results a viewing and listening machine . this theater 's austerity there are no cup###holders is form and function perfected . it is , unambiguously , a space for watching films , and a rebuke to those sterile multiplex boxes that , with their jumbo sweet and sour treats , overstuffed seats and on screen pabulum , infantilize viewers , who , in turn , seem increasingly interested in the tiny screens in their hands . the only problem is that this theater is in the film museum in vienna , and too distant to cure my occasional moviegoing blues . these blues are not a matter of nostalgia or chatty viewers . moviegoing is a social act , and other people their peccadilloes and sometimes their perversions have always been part of the cinematic###experience , as anyone who frequented the good old , bad old times###square remembers . movie###theaters are sacred###spaces of a type , but at their best they 're inhabited ones , not isolation chambers . the saddest moments in the aviator , martin###scorsese 's film about howard###hughes , are of hughes running pictures alone in his private screening###room , cut off from one of the defining experiences of his age the laughter and tears of a movie audience . in , the year hughes took over the rko studio , an estimated 90 million americans went to the movies each week . that 's a lot of joy to have missed . it 's the shared###experience this laughter signifies that seems to be slipping###away when someone gazes into a hand held device instead of at the big communal screen . moviegoing changes from year to year , audience to audience , country to country . during the so called silent###era , audiences used to talk about what was happening on screen while watching films , a practice that changed but did n't disappear with the introduction of synchronized###sound . ( shh ! ) yet , while updating your facebook###page as you 're watching a film may be part of a historical continuum , it 's also true that the informal contract that turned an individual viewer into part of a collective audience when she settled into a movie###theater seat has frayed . when you go to a movie###theater , you understand that no matter what else you do in that space , whether you grab for your partner 's hand or a bucket of corn , you 're there for the movie . however charming , outdoor screenings , much like those ubiquitously pulsing , glowing cellphones , suggest that movies and moviegoing no longer exert the hold over the audience that they once did . take a movie outside or check your cell midscreening , and you 're no longer at the movies , but rather back in the very reality that the movies promise to deliver you from . in doing so , you reject the very possibility of the art 's transcendent power and you may just risk becoming like poor little rich howard###hughes , who , all alone in the dark , obsessively became lost in a private world far from the communal embrace .
east###lansing , mich . michigan###state got manhandled and outhustled by north###carolina . and , the spartans' school record , three week run as the no . 1 team in the associated press college###basketball poll ended with a thud . the tar###heels had five scorers in double###figures and more players going after loose###balls and rebounds in a 79 65 win over michigan###state on its home###court wednesday###night . we looked like a softer team , spartans coach tom###izzo said . that solely falls on me , nobody else . despite playing in a highly###anticipated game in front of fired###up fans , michigan###state ( 7 1 ) looked listless early and could n't recover . the tar###heels scored the first six points of the game and led 16 4 while holding the spartans to 1 for 7 shooting with four turnovers . they came out and hit us in the mouth first , michigan###state guard gary###harris said . we never even got the lead . they came in with a lot of energy and got the win . the spartans started the season ranked no . 2 and moved to the top spot by beating then no . 1 kentucky , becoming just the third top ranked###team in program history . they had one lackluster win over columbia after beating the wildcats , then were relatively impressive in the previous five games . behind the scenes , though , izzo was worried that his team would n't fare well against north###carolina . harris has been slowed by an ankle###injury , adreian payne is playing with a foot ailment and matt costello might have mononucleosis . we played how we practiced , izzo said . the tar###heels , meanwhile , were forced to watch more film from their loss to uab which followed a win over then no . 3 louisville the night before they played at michigan###state because coach roy williams still had some teaching points he wanted to make . i told them at that point , the uab game was over , williams said . north###carolina ( 5 2 ) made the most of its opportunity to flash its potential , dominating a team that had n't lost at home to an unranked , nonconference opponent for more than a decade . they came off a loss and they looked hungrier , izzo said . we came off all the hype and we looked not as hungry . kennedy meeks scored 15 points , brice johnson had 14 off the bench , marcus paige and nate britt added 13 apiece while j.p . tokoto had 12 points and a career###high 10 rebounds for the tar###heels . i truly believe after the louisville win , our mentality after that was , 'birmingham is just going to be an automatic win . just because we 're north###carolina , ' tokoto said . we ca n't have that mentality and kind of learned that sunday###night . we came here , were ready to play , intensity level was up , and we got results . and , the spartans were n't###ready and did n't###respond later in the game when it was clear they had to play with more energy and passion to compete . one of the more disappointing performances of my career here , izzo said . from the jump###ball , they kind of took it to us . the tar###heels took control from the start , never trailed and used a 12 1 run to take a 65 52 lead with 02 left . michigan###state did not want it that much more than we did , north###carolina coach roy williams said . north###carolina outrebounded the spartans by , leading to 19 second chance points . the tar###heels turned 14 of michigan###state 's turnovers into 19 points and held the spartans to 36 percent###shooting . we 're as happy as we can possibly be 179 degrees away from where we were after the uab game , williams said . you ca n't tell in college###basketball what 's going to happen , williams said . at one point , we had three freshmen , a sophomore and a junior on the court . harris had 17 points and keith appling scored , but both michigan###state guards missed 10 of 15 shots . payne had 16 points and eight rebounds for the spartans , whose last loss at home against an unranked nonconference team was toledo on dec . 30 , 2002 . the tar###heels beat a no . 1 team for the first time since march , 2006 , at duke , and they have a nation high 13 wins over top ranked###teams . they 've won seven straight against the spartans , including in the 2009 ncaa final . honestly , i think this is going to be good for us , michigan###state center matt costello said . we came in with high###expectations of doing well . and we 've got the guys to do it .
( reuters ) it took mesut ozil just 11 minutes and two touches to fuel the excitement of arsenal fans on saturday as the club 's record buy set his new team on the way to their third consecutive premier###league victory , 3 1 at sunderland . ozil , signed from real###madrid for . 5 million###pounds . 43 million ) at the end of the transfer###window , took the plaudits on his debut on a day when paolo###di###canio 's emotions got the better of him again . sunderland 's manager was sent off by martin###atkinson after the referee had denied the black cats a second equaliser at the stadium of light , infuriating the under pressure italian . ( atkinson ) came to me and said if you keep going with your manner i will send you up to the stand , di###canio told the bbc . i said to him , 'if you want to complete a perfect job , you send me off' . and that is what he did . i will never invite the referee to send me off again . sunderland 's third defeat of the season left di###canio dealing with life at the bottom of the league but , after their own shaky###start , arsenal are looking upwards . with ozil 's capture , manager arsene wenger bowed to fans' demands and finally spent big , smashing the club 's transfer###record . the manner in which ozil provided the opening###goal showed why wenger staked his future on the germany midfielder . ozil controlled a long , high clearance with one touch and then weighted a perfect pass for french striker olivier###giroud to finish at the near post . the german 's contribution came a day after he had missed training through illness , putting his anticipated debut in jeopardy . you 've seen what he is all about , slipping those balls in , he has one of the highest assist rates in europe and he is going to create a lot of opportunities for us , said two goal aaron###ramsey . wenger said in the first half he ( ozil ) was outstanding . he was sick yesterday and did n't practice ... he dropped a bit physically in the second half but overall he was great . ozil later tweeted 3 1 ... i am so proud to be ( a ) member of this team . his creativity could have led to more goals in the first half , particularly for theo###walcott , but for wasteful finishing . it allowed sunderland a way back , as craig###gardner levelled from the penalty###spot shortly after the break . ramsey put arsenal back in front before the moment that prompted di###canio 's anger . sunderland 's jozy###altidore had the ball in the net but the referee had already blown for a foul on the american striker . this is a big###mistake , said di###canio . it 's obvious , this is not paolo###di###canio 's opinion , the referee has to wait and see how the action finishes . when it is body to body with jozy###altidore and bacary###sagna , he has to wait until how it finishes and not stop the game . it was a big , big###mistake . wenger said we were a bit lucky at 2 1 maybe but we found the mental resources to win . it could have been a foul for us as well because altidore took out sagna but the referee###blew before the goal . i was sure of that because i saw him . to make things###worse for di###canio , wales midfielder ramsey then added his second goal of the game and his sixth of the season for club and country . in the last few seasons i 've been getting into the right positions but maybe i 've been lacking a bit of composure but i 'm enjoying it now , ramsey said .

washington one was a black hawk pilot in iraq who left the army after she lost out on the chance to advance to an elite special###operations helicopter combat###unit because it was off limits to her as a woman . another was a marine captain who went on infantry foot###patrols in some of the most dangerous parts of afghanistan , but left###active###duty after she decided that her only future as a woman in the marines was a lifetime of logistics or support###units . the third , a brigadier###general who joined the marines in a different era , made her peace with reality , stuck it out and rose to become the first woman to command parris###island , the service 's south###carolina training###center . for all three officers , the ban on women in combat was not so much a glass###ceiling as a seemingly bulletproof one that limited their career###options even as women played an increasingly###important role in defending the country . for them , the significance of defense secretary leon e . panetta 's decision last week to lift the 1994 ban on women in combat was not just that it gives them the opportunity to fight but also that it offers women a chance to advance in a career in which combat###experience remains essential . growing up in america , you do n't encounter this kind of discrimination , said the marine captain , zoe bedell , 27 , a princeton graduate , recalling her four years on active###duty . now in the marine###reserve , she remains a plaintiff in an american###civil###liberties###union lawsuit against the pentagon for its policies on women and no longer envisions a career in the military . i think my ship has sailed , she said . although women often found themselves engaging in ground warfare in iraq and afghanistan over the past decade , the military did not officially count their actions as combat , and their battlefield experience went unrecognized . many left in anger and frustration , or just disappointment at hitting a wall . special###operations is something i would have tried for , and if i had gotten it , i probably would have stayed around longer , said the black hawk pilot , lindsey melki , 30 , a graduate of the united###states###military###academy . the parris###island commander , brig . gen . lori e . reynolds , 48 , a graduate of the united###states###naval###academy , chose to accept the strictures and , like other american military women of her generation , rose on a path that was available to her . although she declined to be interviewed for this article , in an interview in afghanistan in 2010 she talked about younger military women who were chafing at the combat restrictions . some of these kids , they grew up without barriers , she said . but from my perspective , we are where we need to be . in an e mailed statement on friday , general reynolds said that she now looked###forward to seeing that change is implemented the right way . ms . melki began a 15 month###deployment to iraq in . she spent much of her time there ferrying infantrymen on combat###missions . on more than a few occasions she was a pilot for special###forces troops the army 's green###berets who were hunting down insurgent leaders . flying with the aid of night###vision###goggles , she was given the job of dropping them as swiftly and stealthily as possible into contested areas . at night you could see the tracer rounds coming up at you , and that was a reminder of the fighting out there , she said . when her deployment ended , ms . melki looked around for new assignments and found herself dreaming of joining a special###operations aviation regiment , an elite army unit known as the night stalkers . after all , she had already flown special###forces on secret###missions . i thought , 'why ca n't i do that ? ' she said . the answer because of the pentagon 's ban on women in combat , which prohibited women from serving in special###operations units like the night stalkers . so ms . melki watched as friends and peers , including pilots she considered no better or more experienced than she was , were accepted in the special###forces . i was jealous of them , i was , ms . melki said . their stories seemed cool . instead ms . melki headed to fort###jackson , s.c. , where she commanded a basic###training company of new recruits . she remained there until , when she left the army .
in what federal officials said was the largest###number of medicaid fraud indictments ever filed in new york state , 45 people have been charged by a federal grand###jury in manhattan with the illegal sale and redistribution of prescription###drugs . the indictments against 3 ringleaders , 32 pharmacists and 10 other defendants were filed on thursday and announced yesterday by otto g . obermaier , the united###states###attorney for the southern district of new york . the 45 defendants were among 69 people arrested in raids conducted throughout the new york###city metropolitan region on june 30 by the federal###bureau###of###investigation . thirteen pharmacies were closed and 46 searched in what the f.b.i . said was part of a national crackdown on the criminal diversion of prescription###drugs for illicit sale on the streets and resale to drug stores . federal officials described a black###market in which medicaid recipients , whose medications are paid for by the state and federal###government , sold their prescriptions or the drugs to distributors , who would sell them back to druggists with large medicaid clienteles at reduced###prices . stanley jacobson , of northport , l.i . , who was charged with being a ringleader , was said by prosecutors to have kept such a large inventory of the diverted drugs in a warehouse in farmingdale , l.i . , that he needed a computer to keep track of them . two others , martin bobb , of port###jefferson , l.i . , and donald solof , of howard###beach , queens , were said by prosecutors " to have amassed enormous###wealth from the scheme , including a private airplane , an ambulette business , a real###estate business , numerous bank###accounts and substantial###quantities of cash .

chicago during the national###anthem at chicago###blackhawks home###games , the fans not only rise , but cheer , hoot and holler at the top of their lungs . on tuesday###night , the capacity###crowd at the united###center might have been as loud as it has ever been in welcoming home its team , off to one of the hottest starts in n.h.l . history . the blackhawks returned from a 6 game , 12 day trip with a 10 0 2 record , and though they lost in a shootout tuesday to anaheim , their season opening 13 game stretch without a regulation loss put them three games from the league###record . the ducks set the mark for such a streak when they started 12 0 4 in , the season they won the stanley###cup . considering the n.h.l . 's 48 game schedule this year , chicago has achieved a rather incredible feat earning at least one point in each game more than a quarter of the way through the season . ( the blackhawks' other two losses also came in shootouts . ) it 's awesome , the rookie brandon###saad said . it 's really just awesome to be playing like this . blackhawks players seemed at a loss to explain their scorching start . right wing patrick###kane , tied for second in the league through wednesday with 20 points , said of his success , sometimes the puck finds you . or as the captain jonathan###toews put it , i do n't know if there 's a method to the madness . what is clear is that chicago , which plays the san###jose###sharks on friday in only its fourth home###game of the season , is the n.h.l . 's best team right now . entering thursday 's games , the blackhawks were second in the league in scoring . 31 goals per game , fourth in goals###against###average . 92 ) , and first in goal differential . 38 per game ) by nearly half a goal . kane , 24 , is leading the charge . he spent the lockout playing in europe , scoring 23 points in 20 games and living in a small city in switzerland with his mother . maybe i had a little bit of a head###start playing over in switzerland , he said , almost sheepishly . kane , whose point###totals the last three seasons had fallen from 88 to 73 to , noted that he had off season wrist surgery two summers ago , while this past year he has been able to focus on hockey , not health . kane is part of a core###group that led the blackhawks to the stanley###cup in 2010 and is still around . the group also includes toews , marian hossa , patrick###sharp , brent###seabrook and duncan###keith . but despite the continuity of chicago 's stars , the chemistry of 2010 eluded the team the last two seasons , which ended in first round###playoff exits . depth has been a factor after the championship team lost key pieces because of salary###cap limitations . that team won the stanley###cup because it had more good players than anyone else from top to bottom , the longtime blackhawks television###announcer pat foley said . this season , contributions have come from every line , particularly from bryan bickell ( 7 points ) and viktor stalberg ( 6 points , both third liners . niklas###hjalmarsson and johnny oduya have formed another solid defensive pairing behind keith and seabrook , and the goaltending combination of corey###crawford and ray###emery is much improved , too . there 's kind of a diffusion of responsibility where every single guy takes responsibility , takes ownership that he can do the job , toews said . foley said he noticed a more businesslike approach to this year 's team , something that was perhaps missing during the last two seasons . there 's less frivolity , he said . after an abbreviated training###camp because of the lockout , toews cited the benefits of the early###season road trip , saying it was a huge thing for a team to come together and hang out in the hotel and spend a lot of time together . we can use that and let it carry onto the ice . it all adds up to high###expectations . only two games into the season , hossa , who has recovered from a concussion sustained on a vicious hit by phoenix 's raffi###torres during the playoffs , broached the often taboo subject of championship comparisons . right now , it feels like , he said . chicago , meanwhile , has fallen head over heels for the blackhawks and not only during the star###spangled###banner . the blackhawks' home sellout streak is at 193 games , and their season###ticket###holder waiting list , which is near , 000 , grew by about 250 during the lockout , the team said . the five highest###rated blackhawks broadcasts on comcast###sportsnet###chicago , their local###cable partner , have all come this year . i see more indian heads than i 've ever seen around town , and i grew up here in the '60s with stan###mikita and bobby###hull , foley said , referring to the team 's logo . it 's been that way for a few years now , and , of course , the winning stokes excitement .
affirmative###action 's contentious history sam###tanenhaus on the history of affirmative###action , a program that dates back to the presidency of john f . kennedy and has stirred debate for decades . washington courts must take a skeptical look at affirmative###action programs at public###colleges###and###universities , the supreme###court ruled monday , in a decision that is likely to set off a wave of challenges to race conscious admissions###policies nationwide . the 7 to 1 decision avoided giving a direct###answer about the constitutionality of the program , used by the university of texas at austin , that was before the court . the program will continue for now , but the justices ordered an appeals###court to reconsider the case under a demanding standard that appears to jeopardize the program . the ruling was simultaneously modest and significant , and its recalibration of how courts review the constitutionality of race conscious decisions by the government will reverberate beyond higher###education . the brief decision , issued eight months after the case was argued , was almost surely the product of intense negotiations among the justices . the compromise that the majority reached was at least a reprieve for affirmative###action in higher###education , and civil###rights groups that had feared for the future of race conscious admission programs were relieved . conservatives and other opponents of the current###version of affirmative###action vowed to use the court 's ruling as a road###map to bring future cases . justice anthony m . kennedy wrote the majority###opinion , joined by the four members of the court 's conservative wing chief###justice john g . roberts jr . and justices antonin###scalia , clarence###thomas and samuel a . alito jr . and two of its liberals , justices stephen g . breyer and sonia###sotomayor . only justice ruth###bader###ginsburg dissented , writing that lower###courts were correct to uphold the texas program . justice elena###kagan disqualified herself from the case , presumably because she had worked on it as solicitor###general in the obama administration . the decision did not disturb the supreme###court 's general approach to affirmative###action in admissions decisions , saying that educational diversity is an interest sufficient to overcome the general ban on racial classifications by the government . but the court added that public###institutions must have good reasons for the particular methods they use to achieve that goal . colleges and universities , justice###kennedy wrote for the majority , must demonstrate that available , workable race neutral alternatives do not suffice before taking account of race in admissions decisions . that requirement could endanger the texas program when it is reconsidered by the united###states court of appeals for the fifth circuit , in new orleans . the university 's program admits most undergraduates under race neutral criteria , accepting all texas students who graduate near the top of their high###school classes . but the university also uses a race conscious system to choose the remaining students . courts reviewing government programs that make distinctions based on race subject them to a form of judicial###review known as strict###scrutiny , requiring the government to identify an important goal and a close fit between means and ends . justice###kennedy 's opinion focused on and tightened the second part of the test . strict###scrutiny , justice###kennedy wrote , does not permit a court to accept a school 's assertion that its admissions###process uses race in a permissible way without a court giving close analysis to the evidence of how the process works in practice . courts reviewing affirmative###action programs must , he wrote , verify that it is necessary for a university to use race to achieve the educational###benefits of diversity . that requires , he said , a careful judicial###inquiry into whether a university could achieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifications . justice###ginsburg , who announced her dissent from the bench , said the race neutral part of the texas program worked only because of de facto racial###segregation in texas' neighborhoods and schools . the case , fisher v . university of texas , no . 11 345 , arose from a lawsuit filed by a white woman , abigail fisher , who said the university had denied her admission based on her race . in a statement issued monday , ms . fisher said she was grateful to the justices for moving the nation closer to the day when a student 's race is n't used at all in college###admissions .
new orleans for those who thought anthony d . weiner and eliot###spitzer were finished in electoral###politics after their scandals , who were surprised when they decided to run for office again , who were stunned when they took leads in the polls , who after all that still cannot quite imagine the thought of them winning , meet charlie###melancon . mr . melancon , a former democratic congressman , ran for the senate in 2010 against david###vitter , a skilled politician , champion of conservative causes and also , as he acknowledged to the world in , someone who had committed a very serious sin involving prostitutes . mr . melancon knew the scandal was not by itself enough to win on , but his campaign included it as part of a broader effort to instill doubt about mr . vitter , particularly among women . three years on , mr . melancon is driving around south louisiana drumming up consulting###business . mr . vitter is working away in the senate and is widely###considered a favorite should he run for governor in . according to exit###polls , he beat mr . melancon among white women by a 54 point###margin . as one intimately familiar with the limits of public reproach , mr . melancon ( pronounced meh law sawn ) is not alone . all across the country , politicians have faced opponents tainted by scandal , some of them seemingly muddied beyond saving , and have gone on to lose . some , like mr . melancon , believe that when it comes down to it , partisanship trumps all . others suggested that voters , particularly religious voters , love a good redemption story . still others said their opponents spent so much time deflecting questions about scandals , they never had to face more substantive criticism . and some said most voters just did not really care all that much . voters talk a lot about hypocrisy but they do n't vote based on it , said eric###stewart , who ran last year against scott###desjarlais , a doctor turned republican congressman in a conservative district in rural tennessee . while a few sordid details of dr . desjarlais 's past sprouted up in his first election in , last year 's election was a veritable springtime of salacious disclosures court###filings and news articles described multiple affairs with former patients , with one saying dr . desjarlais had pressured her to have an abortion . in polls , mr . stewart 's campaign found that voters considered the behavior hypocritical and shocking . then you ask them , 'does it change your mind about voting for him ? ' and still a big majority said no , said mr . stewart , who is now working as an assistant development director for a private###school . political###scientists have found that politicians mired in scandal are indeed in worse shape than their colleagues , but that is a relative measurement . a study of post watergate congressional scandals by scott j . basinger of the university of houston found that while scandal tarred incumbents were far more likely to retire or resign , nearly three quarters of those who decided to run again survived their primaries and 81 percent of those who made it to the general###election retained their seats . various elements have been found to favor survival , including the passage of time ( which seemed to help senator vitter , whose scandal was three years old by the time of his re election ) and reassurances from third parties ( which , coming in the form of late endorsements by the south###carolina republican establishment , may have helped the adulterous former governor , mark###sanford , win his congressional race in may . some studies conclude that denial tends to be the best survival###strategy , but this is not really an option when a candidate has sent anatomical photos over twitter like mr . weiner or popped up in a federal investigation like mr . spitzer or , say , had a stripper jump out of his car . such was the case with wilbur###mills , a powerful democratic congressman from arkansas , who a month before the 1974 elections was stopped by the police in washington for driving without his lights on . he was found to be drunk and scratched up , while his passenger , a striptease artist known as fanne foxe , the argentine firecracker , jumped out of his car and into the tidal###basin beside the jefferson###memorial . mr . mills 's republican###opponent in that election was a political rookie named judy c . petty , who had been running a scrappy but effective campaign focused on taxes and a less colorful scandal involving illegal contributions from dairy interests . when she heard about the stripper incident , ms . petty now she is judy petty wolf had a bad###feeling . mr . mills soon appeared before the little rock junior###chamber###of###commerce , admitted his guilt and advised the crowd never to go out with foreigners who drink champagne . he just sort of got away with it , said ms . wolf , who went on to serve in the arkansas legislature . the whole thing probably even helped him win , she said .
the los###angeles###dodgers' clubhouse feels odd to an outsider , with so many famous###names and faces better known for starring elsewhere . from zack###greinke to brandon###league , hanley ramirez to carl###crawford , adrian###gonzalez to josh###beckett the names read like the draft###board in a fantasy league . it might just work , though . the dodgers , flush with cash as they approach their first opening day under new ownership , have cornerstones from the farm system in matt###kemp and clayton###kershaw , and promising international prospects in yasiel###puig and hyun###jin###ryu . their payroll will be about 230 million , the highest in major###league history . the man with the best seat for the show will be the starting###catcher , a . j . ellis , who was drafted in the 18th round a decade###ago out of austin###peay . he was a senior with no leverage , not even the first catcher the dodgers chose in that draft . ellis made , 000 last season , his first as a starter , when he hit . 270 with 13 home###runs and saw more pitches per plate###appearance than anyone else in the national###league . he will earn 2 million this season , which makes him a pauper on the dodgers they will pay more than that to 22 players in , including manny###ramirez and andruw###jones , who are long gone . for the dodgers , a team with eight legitimate starting###pitchers , no bauble seems too excessive . that is why ellis worried last winter , just for a moment , when he saw a report that the team had interest in the veteran catcher a . j . pierzynski , a free###agent . but that night i got a text###message from ned colletti , ellis said , referring to the dodgers' general###manager . just sent me a basic text 'just want you to know , you 're my catcher , you 're my guy . ' that was awesome , to have that reassurance to know that i was part of their plan . ellis , who turns 32 in april , never expected to be an everyday catcher . in college , he said , rival coaches suggested he call them in two or three years , after his pro career had ended . to them , he profiled best as a coach , not a major###league player , and ellis said he trusted their judgment . he decided to treat professional###baseball as a graduate###school for his future in coaching . he would make contacts , absorb the best instruction and refine his game so that he would leave with no regrets . he never was a big prospect , said dodgers starter chad###billingsley , who roomed with ellis in the instructional###league . never one of those . he was just one of those guys who worked his butt off . billingsley was the dodgers' first round###draft###choice in , taken 517 spots ahead of ellis out of an ohio high###school . the next season , at class a vero###beach , ellis was billingsley 's personal catcher teammates called them chappie and gus , after the battery in for love of the game . a more heralded catching prospect , russell###martin , was the regular###catcher , and ellis understood . martin was on the fast###track , reaching the majors to stay by early . ellis took a slower climb , and after a couple of brief call ups , he made his breakthrough in , when he lived with the veteran brad###ausmus for the summer . despite his lack of service time , ellis by then 29 years old had an advanced understanding of the way to handle pitchers , and ausmus said he fit easily into pregame meetings . after games , ausmus said , they would stay up late and talk baseball , something of a graduate course for the rookie . even then , ellis said , his greatest hope was to stick as the backup to martin , and ausmus conceded that he had not imagined that ellis would ever become an everyday player . he did not have any exceptional tools . but the fact of the matter was , he did everything well and just got overlooked , said ausmus , now a special###assistant for the san###diego###padres . you throw on top of that how he prepared for games , how he cared about the team and the pitching staff more than himself , and you had all these aspects that just made him invaluable . when the dodgers let martin leave for the yankees after the 2010 season , they patched the catching spot with the veterans rod###barajas and dioner###navarro . neither had an on###base###percentage above . 290 , and neither returned for . but reaching###base was ellis 's specialty . in the minors , he said , his low personal expectations allowed him to focus on team success instead of his own . working a walk , he said , was often the smartest strategy . it 's funny , i spoke to the minor###league players the other day , and they were asking about my approach , ellis said . half joking and half serious , i said 'the reason i took so many pitches back when i was younger was because i stunk . i knew i could n't hit . ' i tried to be very patient and get in predictable fastball counts because that was my best chance . by seeing so many pitches , ellis said , he learned the strike###zone and sharpened his pitch recognition . when the mechanics of his swing improved , he became a . 300 hitter at class###aaa , with a . 406 on###base###percentage for his minor###league career . last year , his on###base###percentage was . 373 , the best on the dodgers , but more impressive was the way he got it . ellis averaged . 43 pitches per plate###appearance , mostly from the no . 8 spot , where the discipline to lay off bad pitches is essential . the payoff was a one year contract that does not even make him the highest###paid ellis on the team . ( infielder mark makes . 25 million . ) the news was easy to miss , unless you knew how long it was in the making . i 've been through quite a few drafts , and that was one of my happiest moments as a scout , said marty lamb , a dodgers scout since , who gave ellis that first small bonus . obviously , he did n't get much out of college , and he 's been at the minimum . of all the people that are making good money , this guy really deserves it .
minneapolis depleted by injuries to their biggest###stars , the new york yankees were sagging in the relentless al###east race when they arrived in minnesota . four games against their longtime punching###bag later , the yankees have some momentum back . vernon###wells drove in three runs and the yankees pounded rookie kyle gibson and the twins 9 5 on thursday to finish the sweep , their first series###victory in almost four weeks . it 's a new month , and hopefully this is a time that we 're going to turn this around , ichiro###suzuki said through his interpreter after tallying three hits , including a two run triple . travis###hafner had three hits and scored twice , and zoilo almonte and alberto gonzalez also drove in runs for the yankees , who scored 29 runs over the four games . they did n't even need their usual super sized contribution from robinson cano , whose streak of six straight multihit games ended without reaching###base . he still batted . 500 on this seven game road trip with 11 rbis . everyone else seemed to pick it up around him today , manager joe###girardi said . justin###morneau homered twice for the twins , one third of his season total . but gibson ( 1 1 ) gave up eight runs on 11 hits , a walk and a hit batter in 5 1 3 innings with two strikeouts in his second start . david phelps ( 6 5 ) surrendered morneau 's first homer and three more runs in the seventh , when he left with one out . rbi singles by pedro florimon and brian dozier and a sacrifice###fly by joe###mauer helped the twins catch up in that inning , and morneau went deep again in the eighth . that was n't enough . phelps gave up eight hits and four runs , but he struck out five without a walk . it 's huge . we 're going home for a long stretch , and we 're taking some momentum with us . it would 've been real easy to take what happened in baltimore and carry it over here , phelps said . phelps had a decent june until his final###start of the month , when the orioles beat him up for a season most nine runs in 2 1 3 innings last saturday . swept in that series , the banged up yankees brought a five###game###losing###streak to target###field , where their woes were quickly###forgotten . those are frustrating starts for pitchers , and you do n't want to put a couple in a row where you do n't###feel good about yourself , girardi said . the yankees stayed six games behind first place boston in the division . since the start of , including the postseason , they 're 71 23 against minnesota . they 've always had great###players over there since i became manager here , the twins' ron###gardenhire said . great###players do good things . gibson 's debut last weekend matched the anticipation of the 2009 first###round###draft###pick built up in the fan###base , a winning performance with six sharp innings and two runs allowed . this time , he was behind 3 0 after just his 17th pitch . the first five batters produced two singles , two doubles and a soaring sacrifice###fly by cano that oswaldo arcia caught at the wall in left###field . the next batter , wells , hit a two run single . the game , though , was essentially decided in the third inning . gibson hit hafner with a pitch and let him move up on a wild###pitch . then wells sneaked a low arc pop up in the space between arcia and the infield , just enough for hafner to score , arcia to miss a sliding catch by a few inches and wells to get a double . luis cruz followed with an rbi single , his first hit for the yankees , to stretch the lead to . then in the bottom of the inning , the twins found more bad breaks indicative of a slumping team . after consecutive singles to start for the twins , brian dozier 's bunt rolled perfectly down the third base###line where no play was possible . but it strayed a bit too far , across the chalk , and dozier was summoned back to the box . then he grounded into a double###play , thanks to a slick running pickup and same motion , sidearm toss by the shortstop cruz to cano at second base to start the process . mauer struck out looking next on a pitch the catcher believed was low , in disagreement with home###plate###umpire ed hickox . mauer was called out on strikes in his next at bat , too , and he had more words for hickox on his way back to the dugout . the twins have lost 10 of their last 13 games . notes noted yankees birthdays on july late owner george###steinbrenner and radio###announcer john###sterling . ... the twins designated rhp pj walters for assignment after the game to make room for the return of rhp mike###pelfrey to the rotation on saturday . ... the yankees start a 10 game###homestand on friday , beginning with baltimore . rhp ivan nova , 4 . 63 era , in place of hiroki###kuroda , will take the

cortland , n.y . antonio allen has a simple mantra whenever he has a question relating to his safety position ask dawan . and allen is not the only safety on the jets' roster who thinks that way about dawan###landry , who is entering his eighth n.f.l . season . we all look to him as he 's the guy , allen , a second year player , said . he 's a good mentor to us . the strategy , at first , may seem a bit odd landry spent last season with the jacksonville###jaguars . but even if landry , 30 , does not have full comprehension of the playbook , he has far more experience than his fellow safeties . it makes for added responsibility . landry is not only studying his responsibilities in the secondary he is making sure he knows allen 's and everyone else 's . you always have to think about the team more than yourself , landry said . i have to make sure we get on the same page . landry remembers when he was the one seeking###advice . after the baltimore###ravens selected him in the 2006 draft , he asked###questions and received###wisdom from ed###reed , chris###mcalister and samari###rolle , all###pro bowl performers . i see it as a blessing , landry said . i 'm trying to do the same thing those guys did for me . it helps that he has played in coach rex###ryan 's system . ryan was the ravens' defensive###coordinator during landry 's first three seasons in the league , when he compiled five interceptions and four sacks in 34 games . landry joined the jets in april , less than a month after his younger###brother , laron , fresh off his first pro###bowl###selection , left the team and signed a four year contract with the indianapolis###colts . the brothers , while playing the same position , have vastly different personalities . dawan is soft spoken and does not seek attention away from the field . laron , 28 , is known for his rowdy antics , his bulging biceps and his pet , a spider###monkey named mr . gucci . last summer , dawan###landry advised his brother to play with the jets because of his own experience under ryan . laron responded with 100 tackles , 4 forced###fumbles and 2 interceptions last season . now , many jets fans want to know if dawan can match that production . many have approached him at camp and asked which brother is better . it depends on who you ask , he said with a big###smile . if you ask me , i 'm going to say me . mark###sanchez , competing for the starting###quarterback job , praised landry on wednesday when he was asked about how the defense had performed in camp . sanchez said landry could be the jets' best off season acquisition on defense . he 's a tough###guy and a rangy guy , sanchez said . he plays really well , and i know rex loves him . in a move to improve###communication on the field , landry has let allen call out the signals and audibles in the secondary on many plays in practice . landry wants allen to see what he notices on the field to make sure the secondary does not have any blown assignments . cornerback antonio###cromartie said he had developed such a good rapport with landry that they could communicate on the field solely through eye###contact . after losing darrelle###revis and laron###landry , the jets' secondary will be at its best this season when each player knows what the others are doing , dawan###landry said . we have to be the tightest group on defense , landry said , because we are the last line of defense . coach rex###ryan said the rookie###quarterback geno###smith had his worst practice in camp on wednesday , the jets' last in cortland , n.y . smith , who sprained his right ankle in friday 's preseason###game , threw four interceptions , including three in the 11 on 11 scrimmage . that was brutal , ryan said . obviously , the ankle is part of it , but he had way too many picks . he did not look comfortable today . we 've seen guys have bad###days , but this was a really bad day for geno .
seattle robinson cano hit a three run homer and mark###teixeira followed with a solo shot as part of new york 's six run third inning thursday###night , and phil###hughes took a shutout into the eighth for the yankees in a 6 1 win over the seattle###mariners . cano and teixeira were the catalysts for new york 's big third inning that proved to be the yankees only offense as they started a 10 game west###coast trip with a win . new york matched its season high for runs scored in an inning , tagging seattle starter aaron###harang ( 2 6 ) for eight hits in the third before being shut down the rest of the night . hughes ( 3 4 ) won for the first time in nearly a month . he struck out seven before leaving after facing one batter in the eighth###inning . the last time hughes saw the mariners , he did n't make it out of the first inning . hughes lasted just two outs may , giving up seven earned###runs and six hits . on thursday , the mariners did n't get a runner to third base until the sixth###inning when brendan ryan walked and reached third on kyle seager 's one out single the third hit allowed by hughes . ryan was left at third after hughes got pop outs from raul ibanez and kendrys###morales . hughes retired the first eight batters before ryan 's two out single in the third . he then set down seven of the next eight before ryan walked to open the sixth . seattle avoided the shutout thanks to seager 's rbi double in the eighth . the run was unearned because of an error earlier in the inning . the yankees batted around in the third inning , sending 11 batters to the plate and knocking out harang after 2 1 3 innings . jayson###nix and brett###gardner sandwiched singles around austin romine 's strikeout . cano then lined a high fastball into the right field seats for his 15th homer and before harang could recover , teixeira hit his third homer to right center to give the yankees a###4 0 lead . it was new york 's first back to back homers since cano and vernon###wells on may 12 in kansas###city . the battering of harang did n't###stop . travis###hafner singled and kevin###youkilis doubled before wells looped an rbi single . ichiro###suzuki followed with a line###drive over shortstop brendan ryan to score another run and harang 's miserable night was done . the bright###spot for seattle was reliever blake beavan , who was called up from triple a tacoma on thursday . beavan , who was demoted to the minors on may , retired 14 straight batters after taking over for harang , striking out four . beavan 's streak was snapped when hafner led off the eighth with a single , but that was the only hit allowed in 6 2 3 innings . notes suzuki played in seattle for the second time with the yankees . last year was a whirlwind with his trade to new york taking###place while the yankees were in seattle . he was greeted with a tepid ovation before his first at bat but the ichimeter that was a staple of his time in seattle was back in the front row of the right field stands . before the game suzuki , who is staying at the team hotel , joked he never fully###realized how many starbucks there were in downtown###seattle . ... yankees manager joe###girardi said he texted with 3b alex###rodriguez in the last couple of days but it was strictly baseball related . ... seager extended his hitting###streak to 10 games . ... michael###morse ( quad ) returned to lineup for seattle after missing last seven games . he struck out three times .
east###rutherford , n.j . the signature play of the start of the geno###smith era took place late in the fourth###quarter , with the outcome all but decided , on yet another sunday###afternoon when it appeared the jets would lose a game they should have won . fifteen seconds remained on the game clock . fifty five yards stood between the jets and the end###zone . smith , their rookie###quarterback , their default option , scrambled right , away from traffic , toward the sideline . he gained 10 yards . the game would have ended soon afterward if not for tampa###bay linebacker lavonte###david , who shoved smith after both players crossed the sideline , a mistake that would cost the buccaneers the contest . nick###folk connected on a 48 yard###field###goal , the jets stopped the return that followed , and their sideline spilled onto the field in celebration . that play bolstered the first impression smith gave the n.f.l . on sunday not great , but not bad , either . that play was fortuitous and improvisational and far from perfect . but it worked . it gave the jets a chance to win . smith did what the incumbent , and now injured , quarterback mark###sanchez did less and less the last two seasons . he inspired confidence . he played well enough , for long enough , to make you want to see more . ( that should not be an issue , with reports swirling about the severity of sanchez 's shoulder###injury . ) in so many ways , smith embodied this jets team , at least during sunday 's unexpected 18 17 triumph . he had a bumpy spring . he fell to the second round of the n.f.l . draft . he bumbled through a crucial preseason appearance . he entered this game , then , with hardly any expectations , a new face among so many new faces , overlooked , expected to struggle , discarded and dismissed . he did not leave the field sunday a member of a super###bowl contender . but he gave jets fans what have become unfamiliar feelings confidence and hope in the team 's starting###quarterback . i guess he was n't as fazed as everybody thought , offensive###tackle d'brickashaw###ferguson said , and by everybody , he meant everyone outside the locker###room . smith threw for 256 yards against a tampa###bay defense that revamped its secondary this off season . he led the jets with 47 rushing###yards , at a . 8 yards per carry clip . he scrambled and slid and threw on the run , under duress , down the field . at times , he performed his best sanchez impersonation . he fumbled near the jets' end###zone , which set up tampa###bay 's second score . he overthrew a check down pass , designed for maximum safety , into the arms of an opponent . still , smith gave the jets an offensive dimension that sanchez , even at his best , cannot . look at the prominent offenses that incorporated the zone read option last season san###francisco , seattle and washington , all playoff###teams , all teams with mobile quarterbacks . how often those teams run is less important than the threat that they can run when they feel like it . for an offense like the jets' , with a super###bowl most valuable###player in santonio###holmes and a bunch of unrecognizable targets at receiver , smith 's ability to scramble even the idea that he may take off helps everyone around him . that includes each of the nine targets he threw to sunday . it gives them a little extra time , a modicum of extra###space . i 'll tell you where he really helped us , coach rex###ryan said . he ran . he made some plays , and those plays helped us win the game . too often last season when the jets took the field with sanchez under center , the question was less about whether he would make some sort of crippling mistake and more about when and how . some of the best throws smith made sunday were the balls he tossed away , into the stands . on a drive in the fourth###quarter , he found no open targets on second down . he threw the ball toward the cheerleaders on the sideline , and folk kicked a field###goal two plays later for a 15 14 edge . jets fans###booed the offense earlier that series . they would not boo again . smith stepped behind the lectern after ryan and played down his n.f.l . debut . he said some variation of it 's not about me roughly a dozen times . he said , i do n't like to brag on myself . reporters pressed his teammates about the scramble that ended with the flag and changed the game . smith insisted he believed the jets could win when they took over 80 yards from the end###zone with 34 seconds###left . he told tight###end kellen###winslow and guard willie colon he needed just a little extra time . he found winslow for a 25 yard gain . he scrambled away from traffic and drew the day 's most important yellow flag . he set up the game winner . it 's not a movie , colon cautioned in the locker###room . it 's not 'remember the titans . ' it 's not like a disney , miracle type thing . it 's one win , and we 've got a lot of games left . colon is right about that and wrong about that , too . because although it was only one game and although smith did not remind anyone of peyton###manning , he did seem like a better alternative to what sanchez showed the last two seasons . jets fans have seen that show before . they are not sure what they will get with smith . but they want to find out more . later sunday , the locker###room almost empty , smith tugged on his street###clothes . a handful of teammates remained , giddy about the win . sanchez 's locker was empty save for a single hanger on the rack . maybe it meant nothing . or maybe it was symbolic . either way , it was a win .
the turnaround of the american auto###industry is paying off for senior###management , particularly at the ford###motor###company , even with a 29 percent###reduction in compensation for its chief###executive . ford said on friday that it paid alan r . mulally , the chief###executive , about 21 million last year , and paid . 8 million to its executive###chairman , william c . ford jr . mr . mulally 's bonuses dropped to 4 million , from . 4 million in , with a steep###drop in his stock awards and other compensation to about 15 million last year , from about 22 million the year before . those reductions were based on the company 's falling###short of overall performance###targets , especially cash###flow goals . despite the decrease , he remains among the highest###paid auto executives in the world , earning at least 20 million for a third consecutive year for his role in streamlining the nation 's second largest carmaker and returning it to consistent profitability . over all , the company earned . 67 billion in profits last year , a 5 percent###drop from 2011 excluding one time valuation changes . its profits were hurt last year by big losses in the troubled european market , but ford continued to post record pretax profits in its core north###american market . the company also was returned to investment grade by ratings###agencies , and it reinstated its dividend . mr . mulally , who is , was recruited to ford in 2006 just as the detroit automakers were tumbling into a financial###crisis that would force the company 's two main###rivals , general###motors and chrysler , to seek government bailouts and file for bankruptcy . ford survived without federal help and has thrived since , posting pretax profits for 14 consecutive###quarters through the end of , while improving revenue and market###share . g.m. , the largest american car company , paid daniel akerson , its chairman and chief###executive , about 11 million last year . the company has not yet revealed its compensation data for , but last month submitted documents to congress that said it was proposing to pay mr . akerson . 1 million this year . g.m . said that figure was the same level as mr . akerson received in , making his compensation among the highest for seven bailed out companies that remain under pay restrictions imposed by the treasury###department . chrysler 's chief###executive , sergio###marchionne , received . 2 million in compensation in . that does not include his pay as chief###executive of chrysler 's parent###company , the italian###automaker fiat . the pay levels at g.m . and ford far exceed what the companies were paying their executives a few years###ago , when the automakers were losing billions###of###dollars , shutting factories and eliminating thousands of hourly and salaried jobs . in , for example , mr . ford , who then served as chief###executive and chairman of ford , agreed to take no compensation until the company became profitable again . he then recruited mr . mulally from the aircraft company boeing , a move that started ford 's revival . since joining ford , mr . mulally has earned more than 160 million in compensation . he also has been given stock awards totaling about 126 million , according to figures compiled by bloomberg###news service . we believe our 2012 performance clearly shows our management team performed exceedingly well in a difficult environment , ford said in a statement . mr . mulally has indicated that he will retire from ford by . the odds on choice to succeed him is mark fields , who was promoted to chief###operating###officer in december after leading the company 's americas division for several years . mr . fields earned about . 6 million in total compensation from ford in , a slight increase from the previous year . the healthy pay packages come as ford and other automakers anticipate another strong year in the revitalized american car market . sales of all new vehicles have risen 8 percent through february , compared with the same period a year ago . the industry is on track to sell more than 15 million new cars and trucks in 2013 the first time that level has been reached since . while ford 's executives are enjoying the rewards of the company 's comeback , so are its workers . because of its hefty earnings last year in north###america , ford will pay an average of , 300 in profit###sharing checks to each of its , 000 union workers in the united###states .
washington home###prices jumped . 2 percent in may compared with a year earlier , the biggest annual gain since march . the increase shows the housing recovery is strengthening . the standard###poor 's case###shiller 20 city home price###index released on tuesday also surged . 4 percent in may from april . the month over month gain nearly matched the . 6 percent increase in april from march the highest on record . the price increases were widespread . all 20 cities showed gains in may from april and compared with a year earlier . prices in dallas and denver reached the highest###level on records dating to . that is the first time since the housing bust that any city has reached a record high . a separate report issued on tuesday showed that americans' confidence in the economy fell only slightly in july but stayed###close to a five and a half year high , a sign that consumers should continue to help drive growth in the coming###months . home values are rising as more people are bidding on a relatively tight supply of houses for sale . one concern is that rising mortgage rates could slow home sales . but many economists say rates remain low by historical standards and would need to rise much faster to halt the momentum . svenja gudell , senior economist at zillow , a home price data provider , said a big reason for the recent price gains was that foreclosed homes made up a smaller proportion of overall sales . foreclosed homes are usually sold by banks at low###prices . typical home values have appreciated at roughly###half this pace for the past several months , which is still very robust , ms . gudell said . ms . gudell said higher mortgage rates and a probable increase in the number of homes for sale in the coming###months should slow the pace of price gains and stabilize the housing###market . the s. p. case###shiller index covers about half of american homes . it measures prices compared with those in january 2000 and creates a three month moving###average . the may figures are the latest available . despite the recent gains , home###prices for much of the country are still about 25 percent below the peaks they reached in july . that is a major reason the supply of homes for sale remains low , as many homeowners are waiting to recoup their losses before putting their houses on the market . separately , the conference board , a private research group based in new york , said on tuesday that its consumer confidence###index dipped to . 3 in july . that is down from a reading of . 1 in june , which was revised slightly###higher and was the best reading since january . despite the slight###drop in july , confidence remains well above year earlier levels . and consumers are more optimistic about the current job###market . over all , indications are that the economy is strengthening and may even gain some momentum in the months###ahead , said lynn franco , an economist for the conference board . amna asaf , an economist at capital economics , attributed the july drop in confidence to rising gasoline prices . but she said the confidence###index remained at a###level that was consistent with stronger growth in consumer###spending in the july to september quarter .
kevin###garnett and paul###pierce , two almost certain hall of famers , are heading to brooklyn in a blockbuster###trade that could tip the balance of power in the eastern###conference . the nets and the boston###celtics agreed to the trade late thursday###night in the midst of the n.b.a . draft , which was largely###overshadowed by the negotiations . the deal , which cannot be consummated until july 10 for salary###cap purposes , was confirmed by two people involved in the talks . the teams completed the deal when garnett agreed to waive his no trade clause . in exchange , the nets agreed to fully guarantee the 12 million he is owed in . the celtics will receive gerald###wallace , kris###humphries , marshon###brooks , keith###bogans and kris###joseph as well as three first###round###draft###picks , in , 2016 and . the nets will obtain garnett , pierce and jason###terry . bogans , a free###agent , will be sent to boston in a sign and trade deal . an earlier###version of the trade had reggie###evans going to boston . neither team would confirm the deal , although nets general###manager billy king broke into a wide smile when asked about it late thursday at barclays###center , the nets' home , where the draft was being held . king 's news conference was ostensibly held to discuss the nets' draft###pick , duke 's mason###plumlee , whom the nets selected with the 22nd pick . he batted away a half###dozen questions about the trade but acknowledged it obliquely , saying at the time when it 's appropriate , i will address it if possible . but at this point in time , i ca n't . danny###ainge , the celtics' team president , also demurred when asked about the deal , telling boston reporters , i ca n't###talk about that . the trade thrusts the nets squarely into contention in the east , with the size , experience and versatility to challenge the miami###heat , the indiana###pacers and the knicks . pierce and garnett will provide the defense and the tenacity that the nets sorely lacked this past season , when they won 49 games but failed to get out of the first round of the playoffs . they join a lineup that already features three all star talents in deron###williams , joe###johnson and brook###lopez . garnett had preferred to finish his career in boston , but the departure of coach doc###rivers opened the door for a trade , and the inclusion of pierce , his close###friend , made the deal palatable . details of the trade were first reported by yahoo###sports . in pierce and garnett , the nets will also get a dose of locker###room leadership to support jason###kidd , the team 's rookie###head###coach . garnett , even at , remains one of the fiercest defenders in the league . pierce is no longer an elite scorer , but he will not need to score much in a lineup with williams , johnson and lopez . the celtics , who won the title in , have been moving toward breaking up their core since their first round###playoff loss to the knicks . they let rivers out of his contract last week to join the los###angeles###clippers , and they were prepared to send garnett and pierce there along with him until the n.b.a . vetoed the deal as a salary###cap violation . for boston , the trade with the nets will provide a combination of cap relief and future###prospects . the picks in 2016 and 2018 would be unprotected and potentially quite valuable because pierce and garnett will most likely have retired by then . as part of a previous trade , the atlanta###hawks have the right to swap picks with the nets in , so the celtics would receive the lower of the two picks . to make the deal work under salary###cap rules , the teams will have to wait until after july , when pierce 's . 3 million salary for next season becomes guaranteed . but the deal cannot be made official until july , after the league 's annual moratorium on signings and trades is lifted . pierce , 35 , is under contract for just one more season , adding###additional risk for the nets , who will be under immense###pressure to contend immediately . garnett is under contract for two more seasons , at . 4 million in 2013 14 and 12 million in . terry also has two years left on his contract , earning . 3 million next season and . 5 million in . when the deal goes through , the nets' payroll will skyrocket to nearly 93 million for just nine players . it could reach 100 million by the time they are done filling out the bench , which would trigger a luxury tax hit of about 84 million a record . the deal will allow the celtics to drop below the luxury tax line for next season , but the real savings will come in , when their payroll would drop to . 4 million 9 million below the current salary###cap . the draft itself was rendered an afterthought , as much as king tried to promote his selection of plumlee , a 7 foot , 238 pound center from duke , king 's alma###mater . plumlee could become the nets' primary###backup to lopez if andray###blatche leaves as a free###agent . with humphries , evans and wallace heading to boston , the nets will need all the big###men they can find .
( reuters ) swede jonas###blixt took advantage of a last day collapse by overnight leader johnson###wagner to win his second pga###tour title by two shots at the greenbrier###classic in white###sulphur###springs , west###virginia on sunday . four strokes off the pace heading into a weather interrupted final round that ended in fading###light , blixt fired a three under par 67 in rain softened conditions on the greenbrier 's old white course . the 29 year old swede held his nerve over a pressure packed closing stretch , mixing four birdies with two bogeys over the last 10 holes to post a 13 under total of . american wagner , two ahead overnight in his bid for a fourth pga###tour victory , dropped three shots after the turn as he struggled for accuracy off the tee on the way to a 73 and a four way tie for second place . also finishing at 11 under were wagner 's compatriot and playing partner jimmy###walker , and australians steven###bowditch ( 68 ) and matt###jones .
my sights are set on a swingin' girl , so hop on , baby , let 's take that whirl ! yes , it sounds more like dean###martin . but that couplet comes from verdi , at least at the metropolitan###opera these days . the lines are among the seat back titles for the met 's current run of rigoletto , which has its next performance on friday###night . the director , michael###mayer , has set the production in 1960 las###vegas , transferring the thuggish morality of the court of 16th century mantua to the neon lighted , satin jacket world of dino , sammy and frank . setting operas from past###centuries in recent###times is a staple of opera direction today , especially in europe , and it sparks feuds between traditionalists and updaters as regularly as the sun rises . but the met production has a particularly unusual###aspect titles that go beyond the libretto , written by francesco###maria###piave , to a degree rarely seen at the house . the liberties push the envelope on how an opera that had its premiere in 1851 venice can be produced in 2013 new york . an examination of the titles also illuminates the delicate but obscure art of telegraphing an opera 's libretto in brief flashes of two 38 character lines ( an early form of tweeting , perhaps ) without distracting the viewer from what is on the stage or straying too far from the meaning of the text . take the quote above about swingin' girls , in which the duke discusses his philosophy of seduction in the aria questa o quella . the italian literally reads , i would defy even the hundred eyes of argus if a beautiful###woman strikes me . the subtitles also use words and phrases like yikes , get a load of the new dupe , jackpot , pack of lousy , rotten rats , home###run and dreamboat , none of which , it is safe to say , would have been uttered by verdi or piave . the count of monterone , who appears in traditional###arab robes to deliver his curse , is called your sheikness . signor becomes big###shot , bella becomes knockout , fool becomes funnyman or jerk . at the dramatic climax , when rigoletto thinks he is standing before the duke 's body ( alas , it is that of his daughter , gilda , he declares in italian that his nemesis lies at my feet . the met title has rigoletto say , and now i 'm the headliner ! the orchestra plays the notes as verdi wrote them , and the singers sing piave 's original words . but the english###speaking###audience member reading the titles gains a very different impression of piave 's language . the opera 's creative###team says the titles are simply an extension of the opera 's updated setting . in terms of the tone , we wanted to capture some of that 'bada###bing , ' that sort of swinging , rat###pack 'fly me to the moon' language , mr . mayer said . why not make it as fresh and relevant to what 's happening visually as possible ? the fewer disconnects the better . peter###gelb , the met 's general###manager , pointed out that titles have always been loosely rendered , omitting words or changing elements mentioned in the original libretto . the goal is clarity and coherent storytelling , he said , especially when an opera 's setting has been so drastically changed . you 're obliged to have the titles go along , he said . otherwise you pull the rug out from under the change of setting . j . d . mcclatchy , a poet , librettist and sometime met title maker , said that once a director sets the course , there is no choice but to follow . that 's what makes me very nervous about directors , he said , speaking in general terms , that they will change things to suit themselves , rather than the text they 've been given to interpret . paul cremo , the met dramaturge and the man who oversees the titles , said that updating 19th century language was a delicate balancing###act . titles should not wander too far from what 's actually being said , he added , yet convey meaning quickly as the opera train rushes on , match the production 's style and present the essential meaning of the text . it 's an exercise in minimalism , he said . for rigoletto , spanish and german versions are also available , as well as a straight italian condensation reflecting the more archaic original . ( italian is now included for italian operas , thanks to a request by the italian consul , mr . gelb said . ) new york###city opera introduced projected titles to the united###states in , showing them above the stage . twelve years later the met installed its seat back system . now , the vast###majority of opera###houses in the world have some sort of titling . at the met , a cue caller watches monitors of the conductor and stage and follows along with an annotated score , signaling the moment for each title . a technician presses a button to activate it . michael panayos is the house 's head title man . in the case of rigoletto , which runs through may , he and mr . cremo took an existing set of rigoletto titles and rejiggered them to match as closely as possible mr . mayer 's rat###pack spirit . it was like being in the writers' room of a tv show , mr . cremo said . in questa o quella , the duke is a sinatra like figure delivering the aria as a lounge singer , holding a microphone and surrounded by showgirls . mr . cremo said he and mr . panayos read###through the lyrics of sinatra songs to find the right spirit . of the hop on , baby couplet , mr . cremo said i do n't think it 's that far off . it 's a very hip , finger snappy , rat###pack way of saying it . mr . mayer said some tweaks were made after opening###night , including cutting arab from references to the curse to avoid distracting audiences from the general nature of the malediction . mr . mcclatchy said he liked the rigoletto titles but could not resist suggesting some tweaking of his own . i was surprised the titles did n't go a little further , he said . i would have called him duke , not the duke . and he suggested naming the seedy bar run by the assassin sparafucile and his seductive sister maddalena the s m club .
dispatchers in the kazakh border town of dostyk gave this train priority over all other traffic , including passenger###trains . specially###trained guards rode on board . later in the trip , as the train traveled across desolate eurasian steppes , guards toting ak 47 military assault###rifles boarded the locomotive to keep watch for bandits who might try to drive alongside and rob the train . sometimes , the guards would even sit on top of the steel shipping###containers . the train roughly follows the fabled silk###road , the ancient route linking china and europe that was used to transport spices , gems and , of course , silks before falling###into###disuse six centuries###ago . now the overland###route is being resurrected for a new precious cargo several million laptop computers and accessories made each year in china and bound for customers in european cities like london , paris , berlin and rome . hewlett###packard , the silicon###valley electronics company , has pioneered the revival of a route famous in the west since the roman###empire . for the last two years , the company has shipped laptops and accessories to stores in europe with increasing###frequency aboard express###trains that cross central###asia at a clip of 50 miles an hour . initially an experiment run in summer months , h.p . is now dispatching trains on the nearly , 000 mile###route at least once a week , and up to three times a week when demand warrants . h.p . plans to ship by rail throughout the coming###winter , having taken elaborate measures to protect the cargo from temperatures that can drop to 40 degrees below zero . though the route still accounts for just a small fraction of manufacturers' overall shipments from china to europe , other companies are starting to follow h.p . 's example . chinese authorities announced on wednesday the first of six long freight###trains this year from zhengzhou , a manufacturing center in central china , to hamburg , germany , following much the same route across western china , kazakhstan , russia , belarus and poland as the h.p . trains . the authorities said they planned 50 trains on the route next year , hauling 1 billion worth of goods the first train this month is carrying . 5 million worth of tires , shoes and clothes , while the trains are to bring back german electronics , construction machinery , vehicles , auto###parts and medical###equipment . dhl announced on june 20 that it had begun weekly###express freight###train service from chengdu in western china across kazakhstan and ultimately to poland . some of h.p . 's rivals in the electronics industry are in various stages of starting to use the route for exports from china , freight executives said . the silk###road was never a single route , but a web of paths taken by caravans of camels and horses that began around 120 b.c. , when xi'an in west###central china best known for its terra###cotta warriors was china 's capital . the caravans started across the deserts of western china , traveled through the mountain###ranges along china 's western borders with what are now kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan and then journeyed across the sparsely###populated steppes of central###asia to the caspian###sea and beyond . these routes flourished through the dark###ages and the early###medieval###period in europe . but as maritime navigation expanded in the 1300s and 1400s , and as china 's political center shifted east to beijing , china 's economic###activity also moved toward the coast . today , the economic###geography is changing again . labor costs in china 's eastern###cities have surged in the last decade , so manufacturers are trying to reduce###costs by moving production west to the nation 's interior . trucking products from the new inland factories to coastal###ports is costly and slow . high###oil###prices have made airfreight exorbitantly expensive and prompted the world 's container###shipping lines to reduce sharply the speed of their vessels . slow steaming cuts oil###consumption , but the resulting delays have infuriated shippers of high value electronics goods like h . p 's . such delays drive up their costs and make it harder to respond###quickly to changes in consumer demand in distant###markets .
admittedly , the language is reconstructed and from a foreign tongue , but the facts are the facts . in september , in bolzano , italy , saimir pirgu , an 18 year old music student fresh from albania , knocked on the door of the convitto rainerum , a home for students in their late###teens run by the society of st . francis###de###sales . seeking work and shelter , he was told that he was too old and too albanian . leaving###home , the young###mr . pirgu had told his parents , both employed in metal production , that he had been admitted to the conservatorio claudio###monteverdi in bolzano to continue with violin , and this was true . he had also told them that he had won a scholarship , and this was not . as expected , his slender savings ran out within a day or two . so he stood his ground , and the salesians took him in . mr . pirgu , who is now 31 and a tenor with an international career , made his metropolitan###opera debut in 2009 as the peripheral boyfriend rinuccio in puccini 's gianni###schicchi , whose microaria can stop the show . on thursday he returns as alfredo germont in verdi 's traviata , a straight arrow from the country bedazzled by the consumptive parisian courtesan violetta val###ry . as a boy in the balkans , mr . pirgu wanted to play piano , but he had a good ear , so the communist commissars assigned him to the violin . he discovered what was to become his true calling in his midteens . whenever anyone important died , our national###tv station reran 'the three tenors' all day , he said last fall in san###francisco , where he was making his debut as the hothead tebaldo in bellini 's capuleti e i montecchi . who knows why ? when i was 14 or , i recorded them on tape off our tv set . the sound was terrible , but it was good enough for me . i tried to imitate them , but it was impossible . my voice was changing . i had no high notes . once in bolzano , mr . pirgu made good at his new home helping in the kitchen as other lodgers did and at school , where he was soon advised to switch majors . sing , the voice###teacher vito maria brunetti told him . in a year you 'll be a singer . and i was , mr . pirgu said . in , the year he graduated , he also aced competitions honoring the memory of enrico###caruso and tito schipa , tenor paragons of yesteryear . as exotic monikers go , mr . pirgu 's pronounced sigh mere peer goo poses no great challenge . for now , though , a lot of opera fans just settle for the albanian tenor . as the crow flies his homeland lies a mere 45 miles across the strait of otranto from the heel of the boot of italy , but for many in the west it might as well be the dark side of the moon . people ask me if we 're slavs , mr . pirgu said . we 're not . we albanians are a race as old as the greeks and romans . people ask if i 'm muslim . i 'm not . st . peter passed through albania on his way to rome . we 're completely catholic . we 're a small people , just three and a half###million , and we were folded into the ottoman###empire for five centuries , but we never lost our language and traditions . la###traviata is violetta 's opera , and some tenors sniff at alfredo as a second banana . mr . pirgu has a real affinity for the character and loves his music .

new york czech duo andrea hlavackova and lucie hradecka won the u.s . open women 's doubles title on saturday with a 6 7 ( 4 ) 6 1 6 4 win over australia 's ashleigh###barty and casey###dellacqua . hlavackova and hradecka , who upset serena and venus###williams in the semi###finals , overcame a swift start from the australians and finished###strongly to claim their second major doubles title following their 2011 french###open triumph . it was also a second title for hlavackova at this year 's u.s . open after she teamed up with belarusian veteran max###mirnyi to win the mixed###doubles on friday . it 's been amazing , hlavackova said . i ca n't believe i have won two grand###slams this week . i want to thank lucie . she helped me as much as max did . it was third time unlucky for barty and dellacqua , who lost both of their previous grand###slam###finals at the australian###open and wimbledon this year .
london petra kvitova flew the flag for former wimbledon champions on monday when she became the first to make the quarter###finals with a 7 6 6 3 win over doughty spaniard carla suarez navarro . after the high###profile departures of rafael###nadal , roger###federer and maria###sharapova in the first week , kvitova sneaked through on a blustery court three before the main fourth###round action had started on the big show courts . it was not all plain sailing for the 2011 champion , who has yet to rediscover the consistency that took her to world number two 20 months###ago . i was pretty nervous today ... i did n't###play my best , especially in the first set . but it 's important to win the last point which was what i did , kvitova told a news conference . suarez navarro , 24 , the last spanish woman in the draw , harried her from the baseline , moving fast , returning early and chasing down the czech 's booming groundstrokes . she was watched in the stands by fed###cup captain conchita martinez , the only spanish woman to win the wimbledon title when she beat martina###navratilova in the 1994 final . eighth###seed kvitova , 23 , broke the spaniard 's serve and should have finished off the first set in the 12th game but nervy shots allowed suarez navarro to break back , using her rare and elegant single handed###backhand to stinging effect . with big###names like the injured victoria###azarenka and former world number one caroline###wozniacki gone , kvitova was clearly feeling the weight of expectation . everybody is talking about that i 'm the highest###seeded player in my half , i 'm supposed to be already in the final . it 's not really easy to hear that , she said . but the statuesque czech 's power eventually proved too much for her more diminutive opponent and she pressured suarez navarro into slapping a forehand into the net to take the set 7 5 in the tiebreak . emerging###victorious from a tight tiebreak appeared to energies kvitova and she bowled through the second set in 34 minutes , using her big left handed serve , long reach and strength to quell her spanish opponent . kvitova will play 20th seed kirsten###flipkens in the quarter###finals on tuesday . i lost against her last time in miami . so i hope that i can play better tennis than in the last match , she said . we 've never played on the grass , which is quite difficult .
san###diego the mets' 8 2 loss to the san###diego###padres on saturday###night at petco###park was compounded by an injury to the right hander jenrry mejia , who left the game during the fourth###inning while feeling discomfort in his elbow . mejia , 23 , had been pitching well since joining the rotation last month , with a . 22 earned###run###average in his four starts before saturday 's . still , during that strong run , mejia was battling sporadic elbow pain caused by bone spurs . it was a situation he said he would be able to handle until the season ended , at which point surgery would become a possibility . but the pain got to him saturday . mejia said he felt pain while warming up before the fourth , and he exited the game after throwing two pitches that inning . the last time mejia felt a comparable level of pain was during his july 31 start in miami . the pain he felt saturday exceeded that , though , he said . he was pitching to tolerance , and that tolerance was exceeded tonight , apparently , and he had to come out , general###manager sandy###alderson said , adding that the mets could make a roster move on sunday###morning . to that point , mejia had allowed one run , four hits and a walk and struck out five . it was a continuation of the good work he has produced this summer , and mejia said that whether or not he needs to go to the disabled###list , he was at least happy to prove his abilities for a short spell . now they know i can be a starter , and i feel###happy with that , he said , adding , it was very important to me , and i think them , too . the right hander david###aardsma came in for mejia and allowed a single . one out later , he gave up a two run homer to nick###hundley , who sent a 91 mile per hour fastball into the left###field seats to put the padres ahead , 3 1 . one out after that , will venable doubled to right field and scored when alexi amarista singled to center . jesus guzman added a run###scoring single to left in the fifth . daniel###murphy and ike###davis each drove in a run for the mets . the prospect travis###d'arnaud made his major###league###debut , playing catcher and batting sixth . he went 0 for 2 with two walks . nervousness , rush of emotions , excitement it was all of it formed into one , d'arnaud said about his first game . it was just an unbelievable feeling i hope everyone can feel one day . it seemed likely that mejia would miss some time alderson said he would need to visit team doctors before throwing again . if he does miss time , the mets could insert the right hander carlos###torres back into the rotation . torres , who gave up a three run homer to jedd gyorko in the eighth###inning , has started three games for the mets this year .
ottawa an environmental and economic###review panel approved###plans for a pipeline and port project that , if built , will move oil from alberta 's oil###sands to tankers on canada 's pacific###coast . after approval stalled in washington for the keystone###xl###pipeline , which would link the oil###sands to the united###states gulf###coast , the enbridge northern###gateway pipeline , which would cost about . 9 billion canadian###dollars , or about . 4 billion , became canada 's backup###plan for increasing oil###sands production . the current federal###government in particular hopes to add asian###markets to the oil###sands' list of customers . the united###states has long been canada 's only significant export market for both oil and natural###gas . while it is an important###step forward , the approval from the panel organized by the national###energy###board and the canadian environmental###assessment agency is not the final###word on the project . the conservative federal cabinet must give its final###approval by july . while that approval is all but certain given the government 's support for the plan , widespread###opposition from many native groups with land claims along the route , as well as environmental###groups , may lead to legal###challenges . like keystone###xl , the northern###gateway pipeline has been used by some environmentalists as a stand in for their broader concerns about the oil###sands , whose development , they say , is harmful to the environment . but the plan 's potential to create an oil###spill off british###columbia 's rugged and scenic coastline also prompted widespread###public opposition in that province . the government of british###columbia has voiced concerns and laid out its own set of conditions for approving the project , although they are symbolic because the matter is a federal issue . the three member review###panel concluded that while a major oil###spill is unlikely , a large spill would initially have significant###adverse environmental###effects on ecosystems . but it concluded that any harm created by a spill could be cleaned up and affected###areas returned to a functioning ecosystem similar to that existing prior to the spill . after weighing all the oral and written evidence , the panel found that canada and canadians would be better off with the enbridge northern###gateway project than without it , the report said . environmental###groups , which argued at hearings that conventional###oil spill technologies could not handle the heavy , tarlike bitumen that comes from the oil###sands , swiftly condemned the panel 's conclusions . those groups failed in efforts to include the overall impact of oil###sands extraction in the review . karen wristen , the executive###director of the environmental###group living oceans , which is based in vancouver , said the panel 's approval was expected . but she added that environmentalists would only increase their efforts to block the project . this is only the beginning of it , she said . in a statement , enbridge , the pipeline company , said that it would work to fulfill 209 conditions laid down by the panel . northern###gateway has worked with one goal in mind to access new markets by building a safer , better pipeline , said janet holder , the leader of the northern###gateway project for enbridge . the joint review###panel conducted the most comprehensive and science based pipeline review in canadian history , and their report reflects the input of thousands of canadians . their report is an important###step towards that goal . mary polak , the environment minister for british###columbia , said her government needed to study the panel 's report . we are not yet in a position to consider support for any heavy oil###pipeline in b.c. , she told a televised news conference . while some political###analysts believe that the current federal###government has been using the prospect of canadian oil###exports to china through northern###gateway as a form of pressure on washington , expanding canada 's oil###exports to other countries has long been a national goal . to date , however , there have not been firm commitments from asian buyers for the , 000 barrels of diluted bitumen a day that the pipeline would carry . jennifer winter , a research###associate at the university of calgary who recently studied the ability of asian refineries to handle bitumen , concluded that sufficient###capacity exists . demand , however , may be another matter , she said . there is demand but maybe not as big as the politicians would like or even the energy companies in canada would like , she said . kinder###morgan , the american pipeline company , has also applied for approval to expand the capacity of an existing pipeline from alberta to british###columbia that it owns .
trindon###holliday stands just 5 foot 5 and might tip the scales at 170 pounds if he wolfs down a big###breakfast . still , he figures he knows exactly how those big , beefy baseball sluggers must feel drawing intentional###walks . holliday , the denver###broncos' speedy kick###returner , is flustered that he does n't get the chance to showcase his skills all that much on kickoff returns , and he is not alone . so when the ball does land in his hands , even if it is very deep in the end###zone , even if the wiser thing to do is take a knee , he wants desperately to take it out . it might be the only one you get all day , holliday said . sometimes , it does n't work out and the returner is smothered before he can reach the 20 yard###line . the elite ones , though , can still change a game . it just does n't###happen as often as it used to . for the first time in n.f.l . history , more than half of all kickoffs could end up as touchbacks this season , three years after the league moved the kickoff up from the 30 yard###line to the 35 to reduce the number of returns and the number of concussions . big shoes to fill the pro###football###hall###of###fame will get the right cleat that matt###prater wore when he kicked the longest###field###goal in n.f.l . history . just not for a while . yeah , they asked for the cleats , prater said . i said i 'd give them to them after the season . if the denver###broncos ( 11 3 ) and their strong legged kicker can help it , that package wo n't be arriving in canton , ohio , until after the super###bowl in february . prater kicked a 64 yarder on the final play of the first half against tennessee in 14 degree weather on dec . 8 in denver . jaw surgery bengals punter kevin huber is scheduled for surgery friday on his broken###jaw , a season ending injury that left the team looking for another punter and holder to help them as they try to secure a playoff###spot . huber was hurt during a 30 20 loss in pittsburgh on sunday###night . terence garvin blocked him during antonio###brown 's 67 yard###punt###return for a touchdown , hitting huber 's chin with the top of his helmet . around the league the new orleans saints released kicker garrett###hartley two days after he had one field###goal blocked and hooked another wide in a loss at st . louis . ... the titans signed quarterback tyler wilson off the oakland###raiders' practice###squad and have waived quarterback john###skelton to make room for him . ... the pittsburgh###steelers placed linebacker lamarr###woodley on injured###reserve with his second significant calf###injury of the season .
the best golfers in the world came to merion###golf###club for the 113th united###states open , and an amusement###park ride was awaiting them . for sunday 's final round , merion 's east course was set up to resemble a , 853 yard cobra loop , with more ups###and###downs and twists and turns than the storm runner at hersheypark . two by two , the golfers took off at no . 1 on a stomach churning whirl , climbing up the leader board only to drop without warning in the time it took the wind to shift or their focus to drift . like most adrenaline filled endeavors , it seemed like great###fun only after it was blessedly over . for phil###mickelson , known as phil the thrill for his derring###do , it looked as if he was on the ride of his life , one he had been queuing up for more than 20 years to take , when he holed a wedge shot from the rough for an eagle on the par 4 10th to regain the lead he had lost with two double bogeys in the first five holes . but mickelson , a four time major champion , could not ride the momentum of his highlight###reel 2 to victory . there will be no plaque placed at the spot , some 70 yards from the green , to commemorate the perfect shot he struck with his 64 degree wedge . mickelson made bogeys at nos . 13 and 15 and was overtaken down the stretch by justin###rose , who played the final seven holes at even par for a final round , even par 70 and a 72 hole total of one over . it was another unwanted tie on father 's day for mickelson , whose 74 dropped him to three over , the same score posted by the australian jason day , one of five players to hold at least a share of the sunday lead . for me , it 's very heartbreaking , said mickelson , a six time runner up in this championship . of all his near misses , mickelson said , this possibly was the toughest to swallow . he turned 43 on sunday , so he knows his opportunities are dwindling . i think this was my best chance , he said . rose , 32 , became the first englishman since tony###jacklin in 1970 to win the united###states open . and in securing his first major championship , rose completed a loop on his roller###coaster career , one that saw him turn professional at 17 after finishing###fourth in the 1998 british###open and miss the cut in his first 21 events before gradually developing into the star everyone expected him to be . it feels absolutely amazing , rose said . going forward , it gives me a lot of confidence . rose weathered five bogeys sunday , following the philosophy of olin###dutra , the winner here of the 1934 united###states open who said nobody ever changed history . just hit the next one better . hitting the next one better proved a tall task for the other players who began the day with the trophy in their sights . steve###stricker , who started the day one stroke out of the lead , had been sniffing merion 's small greens like a bloodhound all week . in the first three rounds , he hit 78 percent . on the second hole , he shanked his approach after hitting his drive out of bounds on his way to a triple bogey . stricker , 46 , never recovered , recording a 76 to finish tied with luke###donald at six over . donald began the fourth###round two strokes back . on the third hole , a par , he knocked down a volunteer with his tee###shot and was so shaken by her pain he compounded his agony by making a bogey on the hole and then going bogey , bogey , double###bogey . jason dufner , who started in the 25th group out of , made the charge that the day 's early finishers predicted was there for the really intrepid . eight over at the round 's start , dufner reeled off five birdies , with no bogeys , in the first 14 holes . he was at three over when he arrived at 15 and six over when he left after hitting his drive out of bounds to set up his triple bogey . dufner rebounded with a birdie on no . 16 and posted a , one of six sub 70 scores , for a 72 hole total of five over , to finish tied for fourth with ernie###els , billy###horschel ( 74 ) and hunter###mahan . the course , with its shaggy rough and turtle shell greens , was not everybody 's idea of a thrill###ride . martin###laird , a scot who carded a , one of the lower rounds of the day , to finish at plus , said i enjoy it now that it 's over and i have shot two under but to be honest i do not like the setup . i think that they try to push the envelope a little too far in the first few rounds . noting that the united###states open was held here for the first time in 32 years , rory###mcilroy , the world no . 2 , said yeah , i mean , some guys want to keep that 30 year gap going . i 'm not too sure just because it 's beaten up on us so much . but i think it would be great to have it back here . mcilroy , who won the united###states open at congressional###country###club two years###ago with a score of 16 under , closed with a 76 to finish at 14 over . never mind the ghosts of bobby###jones and ben###hogan that reside in merion 's attic archive room , mcilroy will be haunted by his scores of other on sunday a double###bogey 6 at five and a quadruple bogey 8 at . in the scramble to make pars , it was easy for players to forget that they were sullying the hallowed###ground where jones completed his grand###slam in 1930 and hogan completed his comeback from a career###threatening car###accident in . when you 're out there , you 're just trying to think about playing and thinking about trying not to make bogeys , mcilroy said . finishing one stroke ahead of mcilroy , at 13 over , was the world no . 1 , tiger###woods , a three time champion who closed with a . it was his second highest###total in relation to par in a united###states open , and his worst since turning###pro in . i did a lot of things right , he said . unfortunately i did a few things###wrong , as well .
automakers have traditionally used the lease as a way of making high###end cars and trucks more accessible for consumers who could not afford the full sticker###price . but today , with credit more available and consumer###confidence increasing , automakers are extending the strategy to more moderately###priced cars , which in turn is helping###bring about surprisingly strong###sales results . in august , automakers reported another month of double###digit increases , selling . 5 million vehicles , a 17 percent gain over the same month last year . that puts the seasonally adjusted annual industry sales rate at a postrecession high of . 09 million , up from . 49 million a year ago . it is a promising sign for the industry , which has steadily###increased production throughout the year to meet rising###demand . attractive low lease payments have proven very effective at getting new car###buyers back into the market , said jessica caldwell , a senior###analyst at the industry researcher edmunds . com . in , leasing has accounted for 26 percent of new vehicle purchases , according to edmunds . com . in the years before the recession , leasing accounted for 16 percent to 20 percent , with activity focused on high###end cars and trucks . general###motors , the nation 's largest automaker , has reaped the rewards . on wednesday it said that its august sales rose . 7 percent , its strongest month since september . ford###motor###company , which has taken a more conservative approach on leasing , posted a rise of 12 percent , and the chrysler group , 11 . 5 percent . for all three companies , the increases were led by a mix of small and midsize cars and trucks . auto dealers also point to the revival in leasing , which slowed in the recession as g.m . and chrysler worked through bankruptcy , as a factor . leasing has made an amazing recovery , said kirt frye , president of sunnyside automotive###group in middleburg heights , ohio . higher residual values , thanks to a robust used car market , and record low###interest###rates mean lower monthly###payments for buyers with good credit . the average monthly lease payment was , down from 416 last year , according to experian automotive , which analyzes automotive data . at sunnyside , leases make up one out of three vehicles sold at the dealership 's chevrolet , toyota , honda and mitsubishi marquees , mr . frye said . that rate is up from one out of five vehicles sold 18 months###ago . the dealership 's luxury audi brand continues to sell about 60 percent of its vehicles through leases , which is in line with the high###end automaker 's usual business . but the real growth in leasing has come from the 199 monthly###payments offered regionally this summer on the chevrolet###malibu , honda###accord and toyota###camry midsize sedans , mr . frye said . i think that with the 199 price###point , people say , 'yeah , i see the value there , ' mr . frye said . the strategy appears to be working . in the highly###competitive market for midsize sedans , toyota sold , 713 camrys last month , a year over year increase of . 8 percent . honda###accord sales rose . 8 percent , to , 559 vehicles . the chevrolet###malibu trailed larger competitors , selling , 890 vehicles , but increased monthly###sales . 5 percent . all four of g.m .

after a disappointing showing in their series opener against the chicago###blackhawks , the detroit###red###wings delivered a strong response with a###4 1 victory saturday###afternoon . damien brunner and brendan smith scored in the second period for the visiting red###wings , who tied the western conference###semifinal series at one game each . game 3 is monday in detroit . we 've got a real good club now , coach mike###babcock said . and we have n't been good all year . we 've just gotten better . just as the blackhawks did in game 1 on wednesday , the red###wings took control in the second period and put the game away in the third . they kind of used our own style against us as far as holding onto the puck and keeping it away from us , chicago 's patrick###kane said . kane gave the top seeded blackhawks a 1 0 lead at 14 minutes 5 seconds of the first period . on a two on one rush , patrick###sharp tried to send the puck across the slot to kane , but detroit 's kyle###quincey sprawled to block the pass . the puck bounced to a trailing michal handzus , who fed it to a wide###open kane in the right slot . he fired it into the net for his first goal of the playoffs . chicago 's momentum did not last long . brunner tied the score when he deflected a wrist shot by jakub kindl early in the second , and smith gave the red###wings a 2 1 lead after taking a pass from the captain henrik###zetterberg late in the period . over all , i think we had more energy , zetterberg said . we did a lot of the little things better than we did in game , and when we got our chances , we were able to put the puck in the net . detroit took a 3 1 lead at 19 of the third when johan franzen fired a shot past corey###crawford after a perfect pass from jonathan ericsson . valtteri###filppula 's goal at 03 closed the scoring . sharks , kings 1 logan###couture scored a power###play###goal 29 into overtime , and host san###jose cut los###angeles 's series lead to . dan boyle had a power###play###goal early in the first period for the sharks , and antti###niemi made 26 saves . the rookie tyler toffoli scored for the kings , who had won six straight###games . jonathan###quick stopped 38 shots . before the game , the n.h.l . gave the sharks a , 000 fine for general###manager doug###wilson 's criticism of the suspension of forward raffi###torres . after a hit that injured the kings' jarret###stoll in game , torres was barred for the rest of the series . spezza rejoining senators the star forward jason spezza , who has not played since jan . 27 because of back surgery for a herniated disk , will rejoin the ottawa###senators on sunday for game 3 of their series against the pittsburgh###penguins . ottawa is trailing in the series , 2 0 .
i was doing stand up and being offered a lot of bad tv shows because hollywood was n't###interested in me as a comedian . at all . i auditioned a couple of times by circumstance . al###franken saw me in san###francisco , and i was n't picked . a couple years before that , there was a gang audition at the comedy###store . i went on at midnight , and i followed sam###kinison . there 's sam###kinison , the room levitated . and now , from a mike offstage , dana garney . i played to dead###silence . the next time it came around was in ' . i was starting to do characters . i think i was a sketch player trying to break out . bill murray , dan###aykroyd , john###belushi they were guys who might make you laugh , but they could beat you up if they wanted to . i looked like timmy from the lassie show . the big###break that almost was n'tlorne saw me at this little club on the west side of los###angeles called igby 's . rosie o'donnell was headlining . i was going on first , and i got 40 minutes instead of . but on the way to the club , i ran out of gas . i went to a gas station , and they came out and said in generic foreign accent we are out of gas . there 's no gas here . i 'll###never###forget that . really ?

we 've sort of seen it . phil###hartman was there , and jim###carrey was there , auditioning as well . he just stood on his pinkie , and his whole body was straight in the air , and he put his foot over his head . i thought , oh , you 're going to get it , jim . we were in some kind of holding room , and i remember phil saying to jim well , you 'll get it . or at least a featured player . throw me some sugar , phil , come on ! lorne would claim later that he already wanted me on the show . and i thought i 'd sort of bombed . but then i met with him in los###angeles , and he was very intimidating . incredibly bright , and you know he 's not going to giggle at your jokes or fawn . lorne###michaels voice i thought it was interesting . you never know who you 're going to pick . there was one gentleman , and there was something about his shoes . it did n't seem like that thing of , like , those are the shoes you would want to wear , on , like , your feet . i think lorne cast us like a sitcom . i think he tries for balance . he does n't want six of the same . we were an assortment pack phil was the glue , and he played the dads and the game show hosts . i played the novelty players . immediately , when i found out i 'd been selected , my first emotion was oh , i kind of wish i was n't . the pressure started to ratchet in a second . i played a pizza###parlor in martinez , calif . , for four people , a couple###weeks before i got snl . the show did n't start till october , but i moved in with lorne in amagansett n.y . in august . all of it was completely surreal . i 'd never known a wealthy###person like that . his place , it seemed bigger than god . paul###mccartney came over , and we hung out with lorne and chevy###chase . i remember one day lorne was out it was 100 meters away , but he was naked on a massage table in the sun , being massaged . it was like , o.k . you 'd open his refrigerator , and on one side was bottles of san###pellegrino and the other side was amstel light . like hundreds of them . dana , you can take jack 's room . you know , where jack###nicholson stayed . we the 1986 cast members were very green . we were told the show was not picked up for the full season , so we had that double pressure , too . we had eight episodes . michaels voice we 've got to hit the ground running . and then the church lady happened , which was just a gift from god . but it took me years to get out of my own head on snl that voice going you blew that line , you stumbled on that , you missed that cue , this is not working . you 're bombing in front of lorne###michaels . this is not good . i could show you an early###church chat where my hand goes up and it 's just drenched in sweat . laughs . but the last three or four years , i started to enjoy it .
pittsburgh it was one of the more memorable comments by a general###manager in recent###memory , and it said everything about the often conflicting goals of the job . when the pittsburgh pirates ' neal###huntington failed to make a move at the july 31 trading###deadline , he summarized his efforts this way we were willing to do something stupid . we just did n't want to do something insane . to huntington , the insane move would have been to trade the jewels of a carefully built farm system essential to long###term success in a small###market . but stupid ? when your team was trying for its first winning###season and playoff###appearance in 21 years , you could afford to be stupid . we were willing to overpay , but we just could n't go to the insanity level , huntington said sunday###night , after the pirates beat the st . louis###cardinals , 5 3 , to move within a victory of the national###league###championship###series . we could n't give up a premium prospect for a two month rental . instead , we gave up four solid prospects for three one month rentals . but we wanted to help this club , especially the offense . the pirates scored the fewest runs of any of the 10 postseason teams , ranking 20th in the majors with . 91 a game . after the july deadline passed , huntington 's only option to fix the problem came from making a waiver claim and working out a trade . when the mets put marlon###byrd 's name on the wire , huntington pounced , hoping that a team with a worse record would not claim him first . nobody did , and the pirates sent reliever vic black and a class a infielder to the mets for byrd and john###buck on aug . 27 . four days later , huntington shipped two more players to minnesota for first baseman justin###morneau . we 're a much better offensive team with the addition of those two guys , because it puts pressure on that opposing###pitcher more than it did before , said the hitting coach jay###bell . they 're veteran guys , they understand how to hit , they give you good , professional at bats on a regular###basis , whether they get hits or not . it changes the feeling the opposing###pitcher has about our lineup . the pirates have won both of their home###games here this postseason , and both times , byrd has struck first . he homered in the wild###card game against cincinnati and drove in two runs with a first inning single on sunday , when he figured in each scoring rally . in the sixth , with the score tied , 2 2 , byrd doubled to send andrew###mccutchen to third before russell###martin drove###home a run with a sacrifice###fly . in the eighth , byrd walked to chase reliever carlos martinez , before pedro alvarez 's go ahead single off kevin siegrist . twelve seasons , first postseason appearance , byrd said . i 'm trying to soak it all in and at the same time stay###focused . you look at the crowd and you get lost in the energy and the atmosphere . just having a heck of a time . for byrd , who hit a combined . 291 with 24 home###runs for the mets and pittsburgh , this season has been as exhilarating as last season was sobering . in 47 games with the chicago###cubs and the boston###red###sox , he hit . 210 with one homer . he also served a 50 game suspension for testing###positive for tamoxifen , a banned###substance . byrd has explained that he took nolvadex , a medication to control gynecomastia , the enlargement of breast tissues in males . the condition can be caused by steroid use , but byrd said he did not know why he had it . he told newsday that he did not know nolvadex contained tamoxifen . it was me not doing my homework , he said . while serving his suspension , byrd worked to generate more lift in his swing , and then played###winter###ball in mexico . he signed with the mets for , 000 , the kind of bargain teams like the pirates depend on . but pittsburgh passed on him last winter . we had some guys internally that we liked , and we were n't sure , truthfully , where he was headed , huntington said . to marlon 's credit , he went to winter###ball , made some adjustments to his mechanics and had a monster year . after staying with the mets through july , byrd said , he never expected a trade . indeed , the mets probably would have kept byrd if another team , like the reds , had put in a claim to block him and not made an acceptable trade offer . ( before he was fired as the reds' manager , dusty###baker made pointed references to how much byrd helped the pirates . ) byrd said he was walking to his car , about to leave for a game at citi###field , when sandy###alderson , the mets' general###manager , told him of the deal . byrd continued on to the ballpark , took his things , then packed his apartment and drove to pittsburgh . he homered in his first game for the pirates . my time to reflect was that six hour###drive , byrd said , adding later , for six hours , i was thinking back to everything i 've gone through to the spot where i was going . that spot was rocking again sunday , whipped into a frenzy as the pirates became the final n.l . team to host a division###series game . the fans waved black towels to match their shirts , a jolly###roger flag hung from the clemente bridge across the allegheny###river , and the pirates never trailed after byrd 's hit in the first . he 's been that missing###link for us , said mccutchen , wearing a byrd is the word t###shirt by his locker after the game . day in and day out , when guys get on , he stays within himself and keeps the inning going . he 's done an amazing job of that . huntington did a comparable job this summer , staying within his means , avoiding the insane and finding the inspired .
in the annals of american music in the 20th century , no record###label had a more unlikely origin or trajectory than paramount###records . founded in 1917 as a subsidiary of the wisconsin chair company , which was eager to supply content for the phonographs it had begun to manufacture , paramount took a scattershot approach to its business , recording more than , 000 tracks of blues , gospel , hot jazz , treacly pop , and hillbilly and ethnic###music before going bust during the depression . so it seems appropriate that a new paramount boxed###set , due out on tuesday , is literally that an oak box , stamped with the wisconsin chair company 's logo , that mimics one of the talking machines paramount 's parent produced . the cabinet###of###curiosities even comes with what initially seems to be a key for a vintage phonograph but which , in a distinctly 21 st century touch , turns out to be a flash###drive stocked with , among other things , 800 tracks of music in mp3 format . we wanted to highlight a whole menagerie of things , said jack###white , formerly of the white###stripes and now the leader of dead weather , who played a role in both the design of the set and the selection of the tracks . this paramount music , i wanted to make it as appealing as possible to somebody in a physical , tactile way , all of that , the smell , everything , so as to lead you into the incredible stories that are contained in the music . the set , the rise and fall of paramount###records , is a joint###project of mr . white 's third man label and revenant records , founded by the guitarist john###fahey and run since his death in 2001 by dean blackwood . it draws from paramount 's first decade and includes recordings by major figures like jelly###roll###morton , king###oliver , fletcher###henderson , alberta###hunter , ma###rainey and blind###lemon###jefferson , as well as oddities from first time performers who faded into history . spectacular though it may be , the rise and fall of paramount is only the latest example of a trend that has been gaining###ground in american music over the last decade . as pop drifts further and further from its roots in blues and country , some contrarian listeners are moving in the opposite###direction , seeking out artists from the earliest###years of the recording era . one result has been a conspicuous increase in reissue projects on labels that exist specifically for that purpose or , like smithsonian###folkways , have partially embraced it . some of those labels , like yazoo and origin jazz library , as well as ace and document in britain , have been around since the vinyl era , but others , most notably the atlanta based dust to digital label , are purely products of the cd era . what we are always trying to do is fill in gaps , said lance ledbetter of dust to digital , whose first project , a six cd compilation of early 20th century religious###music called goodbye babylon , was released 10 years###ago sunday . the younger###generation wants to be transported . it 's easy for them to be jaded because everything is one search away . but they go into a shop and see one of our sets of never before reissued music , and they say , 'this is n't like something i downloaded or saw on youtube . ' it 's opening up their world to a whole new music . reflecting that awareness , a national recording preservation###foundation , authorized by congress , recently began###operating , aided by a , 000 donation from mr . white , who also sits on its board . gerald seligman , the executive###director of the nonprofit foundation , suggested that digitized vintage reissues not only sound infinitely better than they used to back in the era of turntables , when every scratch and hiss was magnified , but retain an appealing authenticity that can be enhanced with the proper packaging . before the multitrack era , performances were done live in the studio , he noted . so there is a kind of immediacy and honesty to those recordings that makes them feel like a person in a room . music has been cheapened to the point that many people expect it to be free , he continued . when your competition is free , you 've got to think about who wants this material and what they want with it . deluxe packaging means it will be expensive , but some people have a certain nostalgia for the physical###object . the paramount set , limited to , 000 copies and carrying a list###price of , takes that concept to a new level . in addition to the 800 digital tracks , the package includes a six lp vinyl sampler , encased in a wood album with laser etched titling . the set also comes with two books . one , in large paperback format and called a field###manual , is a kind of encyclopedia , offering 360 pages of biographies of paramount artists as well as a list of all the tracks they recorded for the label , along with the date and place of recording and the names , when known , of the musicians who played on the track .
los###angeles a few months into awards season , at a party celebrating another movie , a veteran actor writer director producer , who takes his academy###awards duties very seriously , whispered to me that he was sure lincoln would win big on oscar night . because it 's lincoln , he said . it 's like not voting for george###washington . and you really feel like you get to know lincoln . we ca n't not vote for our favorite president . the more than , 000 members of the academy###of###motion###picture###arts###and###sciences apparently did not see it as their patriotic###duty to vote for lincoln or its director , steven###spielberg . daniel###day###lewis 's win for his performance demystifying the 16th president was not compensation . mr . spielberg , one studio###boss said , looked stricken when he lost the best director award to ang###lee . in the days after argo won best picture at the ceremony on sunday , it 's been a parlor game among hollywood types to figure out why lincoln lost . after all , it had all the hallmarks of an academy###award dominating film a venerated director a celebrated , erudite scriptwriter in the pulitzer###prize winning tony###kushner a landmark role for mr . day lewis good reviews and even better box###office and , not least , millions to spend on campaigning . lobbying voters is frowned on by the academy and yet a necessity of the monthslong award cycle . this season , insiders said , the team behind lincoln executives at dreamworks and disney overcampaigned , leaving voters with the unpleasant feeling that they were being force###fed a highly burnished history###lesson . it was a good movie , not sliced###bread , one veteran awards watcher said . overreaching was perhaps a failure of the broadcast itself too . the host , seth###macfarlane , and the producers , neil###meron and craig###zadan , tried to marry old school showbiz panache with provocative humor and the result was an entertainment grab###bag the gay men 's chorus of los###angeles a foul###mouthed talking teddy###bear splashy song and dance numbers for every conceivable demographic ( save anybody who likes hip###hop captain###kirk sock puppets ( sock puppets ! ) racist , sexist punch###lines that seemed lifted from the insult comic era and the first lady of the united###states . about the only things missing were kitten videos and the harlem###shake ( but in blackface . but since the ratings were up slightly , especially in the coveted 18 to 49 age###bracket , and despite some high###level protests the reviews were not entirely scathing , the production could ultimately be considered a success . ( mr . macfarlane , though , has already said he wo n't be back as host . ) in a three and a half###hour spectacle of glossy celebration for a roomful of superstars dripping with jewels and self regard , the question of how much is too much may seem moot . but with the right tone and perspective , even that ego parade can seem fun to watch . in choosing mr . macfarlane in its quest for a younger , more male viewership , the academy sacrificed its central constituency women make up the majority of the oscar audience and fomented cultural battles in an awards season already full of them . then again , it was the political posturing that made this one of the most interesting oscar races in recent###memory . as the vibrant discussion of just how much truth bending is acceptable in fact based movies shows , authenticity or at least the perception of authenticity still counts . though it took liberties with its story , argo squeaked by on truthiness . it also triumphed as a consensus choice in a field of high quality candidates , each with its own passionate faction of defenders . as mr . spielberg himself said , when he lost the directors###guild award to ben###affleck and argo , there have been moments when i wish it was a slightly less incredible year for movies . there may have been other reasons lincoln fell by the wayside . dimly illuminated , to replicate the lighting of the period , and stuffed with long passages of speechifying by waistcoated , bearded men , the film did not play well on dvd screeners ( nor , perhaps , did another historically based competitor , zero dark thirty . cynics also say that mr . spielberg , as hollywood 's reigning titan , was primed for a takedown envy being as motivating a force as greed in this industry and that voters were enthralled by the comeback story that mr . affleck represented . somehow mr . affleck could not overcampaign , or at least , his combination of movie star charm and tabloid comeuppance won people over . also , he talked film references like an expert . which , having won an oscar at 25 ( for writing good will hunting with matt###damon ) after a career as a child###actor , this college###dropout turned director pretty much is . casual viewers often wonder if oscar victory comes down to something simpler who makes the best movie . it does not . nor does the funniest person make the best oscar host . there is a narrative to both endeavors , a combination of self effacement and artistry ( voil , mr . lee , being of the moment and timeless , that is hard to pull off . mr . spielberg will no doubt try again , and in the meantime he and the other also rans can console themselves with another prize , hollywood 's ultimate popularity contest record breaking ticket###sales . and next year , may we suggest to the academy , hire jennifer###lawrence to host .
washington when samantha###power , president###obama 's nominee to be ambassador to the united###nations , faced senators at her confirmation###hearing last week , the first question from senator bob###corker of tennessee , the ranking###republican , was how she defined an idealistic , if somewhat obscure , foreign###policy principle known as responsibility to protect . it was a politically loaded question to a woman who made her name as an academic by arguing that nations have a moral###obligation to act against genocide and other mass###atrocities . ms . power answered gingerly , saying that when civilians were murdered by their governments , it 's incumbent on us to look for ways to halt the bloodshed . but , she was quick to add , the principle is less important , i think , than u.s . practice and u.s . policy . the exchange before the senate###foreign###relations###committee captured the awkward place that responsibility to protect occupies in the obama administration . a 2005 united###nations initiative that calls on countries to intervene to prevent genocide and other mass###atrocities , r2p , as it is known , has been endorsed by the united###states and many other countries . some administration officials cited r2p to justify mr . obama 's backing of nato led airstrikes in libya in , which headed off a potential massacre of rebels by col . muammar el qaddafi . yet the administration has said nothing about r2p during two and a half years of bloody civil###war in syria , in which mr . obama has resolutely refused to become entangled . in that case , the strategic complexities of the conflict have outweighed any moral###imperative to intervene###militarily on behalf of syria 's embattled rebels . now , a new report written by madeleine k . albright , the former secretary of state , and richard s . williamson , a former special###envoy to sudan and foreign###policy###adviser to mitt###romney , argues that the administration should wholeheartedly embrace responsibility to protect and explain its importance to the american public . r2p sounds like some chemical###formula , dr . albright said in an interview . it 's in many ways a misunderstood concept it 's up to us to clarify what 'responsibility to protect' means . mr . williamson is blunter . r2p is still struggling , he said , in part because of the administration 's unwillingness to do more about syria , which he criticized as an adviser to mr . romney during the 2012 presidential###campaign . but mr . williamson , who served under president george w . bush , said there were deeper reasons for the american aversion to foreign entanglements , having to with fatigue after a decade of war . it 's a funny time in american politics when you have rand###paul allying with the left about not getting involved overseas , he said . to some critics , particularly on the right , r2p smacks of a multilateral approach to foreign###policy that encroaches on american sovereignty . an aide to mr . corker , for example , said he wanted to make sure that ms . power concurred that the united###states should only decide to act militarily based on its own national###interests . dr . albright said such suspicions were based on two misconceptions , one narrow and one broad . responsibility to protect , she said , calls for the use of numerous tools short of military###force , from diplomacy to economic###sanctions , to try to curb atrocities . more broadly , she said , building a multilateral coalition to deal with foreign conflicts actually strengthens the hand of the united###states . the support of the united###nations###security###council and the arab###league for the nato mission in libya was a force###multiplier , she said . under responsibility to protect , the main obligation to prevent genocide or mass###atrocities lies with the home government . in many ways , dr . albright said , r2p is something that strengthens sovereignty because it makes it the duty of the sovereign to protect its people . the report which was issued tuesday and jointly sponsored by the united###states###holocaust###memorial###museum , the united###states###institute###of###peace , and the brookings###institution offers a list of recommendations , among them that mr . obama should articulate a clear###vision of u.s . support for r2p and should not shy away from using the phrase . the closest mr . obama came to invoking the principle was in march , when he justified the nato airstrikes in libya by saying , to brush aside america 's responsibility as a leader and more profoundly our responsibilities to our fellow human###beings under such circumstances would have been a betrayal of who are . as the death toll in syria nears , 000 , he has not repeated those words . his advisers say syria eludes the kind of effective strike that nato was able to make in libya . ms . power and other officials complain that the united###states has been hamstrung by resistance on the united###nations###security###council , where russia , an ally of president bashar###al###assad , has vetoed tougher action against the syrian###government . to critics , however , the security###council is more an alibi than an obstacle for an administration simply unwilling to act . dr . albright herself pointed out that when russia and china blocked an effort in the security###council to authorize airstrikes in the kosovo###war in , president###bill###clinton went ahead and ordered them anyway . still , dr . albright stops short of criticizing the administration on syria . from experience , she said , she knows how hard these decisions are . in the clinton###administration , she watched not only kosovo , but the white###house 's failure to prevent genocide in rwanda . having not done what we should have done in rwanda , she said , it 's a very tough thing to decide when to do it and when not to do it .
jacoby###ellsbury had his physical###exam wednesday , one of the final steps before completing his seven year , 153 million contract with the yankees . now that he is essentially a member of the team , there is still the matter of who will be playing###alongside him . despite their recent lavish spending , committing 238 million to ellsbury and brian###mccann , the yankees are still trying to keep their 2014 payroll under the 189 million luxury tax threshold . they still have work to do , hoping to sign a starting###pitcher and a hitter , who may or may not be robinson cano . but with mccann , who will be introduced at a news conference thursday at yankee###stadium , and ellsbury now in the fold , the way forward is starting to become clearer . there appear to be two possible paths , one with cano and another without him . for now , the yankees are obliged to assume that alex###rodriguez 's 25 million contract will be in effect for . but if the drug related suspension pending against him is upheld for all or most of the season , all the money he is owed during that time will be freed up . the yankees may not find out about the suspension until january , at which point they may suddenly have millions to spend on a free###agent , or they could add an expensive player by making a trade . if cano and the yankees agree on a contract , which the team would like to be for seven years and around 175 million , the yankees will not have much room under the 189 million threshold . they still plan to sign one or two more relief###pitchers although they are not looking at a closer and hope that hiroki###kuroda comes back for 16 million to 17 million on a one year deal . they also expect to add kelly###johnson as a backup infielder . if cano leaves and yankees officials believe the seattle###mariners could offer an eight year , 200 million contract that they would not match then there is plenty of money left to spend on free###agents , or on the japanese pitcher masahiro###tanaka . the yankees had hopes of signing tanaka this off season , but that was complicated by the ellsbury signing and by developments that were out of their hands . major###league###baseball has been negotiating a new posting system with its counterparts in japan , and it sent over its latest proposal wednesday . under the proposed system , teams would be allowed to make a maximum bid of 20 million , according to two people who have been briefed on the negotiations . if more than one team bids the maximum , the player will be free to negotiate with all of them . a team making the highest###bid would have exclusive rights to negotiate with the player . under the recently expired system , teams could submit bids of any amount , and the team with the highest###bid got exclusive rights to negotiate with the player . with a player as highly###regarded as tanaka , several teams could make a 20 million bid , leaving tanaka free to negotiate with any of them if the new system is adopted . that system could hurt the yankees , especially if they hold to their goal of keeping their payroll below 189 million . under both the old system and the proposed one , the posting fee does not count against a team 's luxury tax figure . but tanaka 's salary would , and the lower posting fee means that m.l.b . teams are more likely to give japanese players higher contracts , which could have an impact on teams that are close to the luxury tax threshold like the yankees . if the yankees bring back cano , they will probably have to forgo signing tanaka . but if rodriguez is suspended for a significant period of time , the yankees will gain a windfall that they could use to pursue tanaka . the arbitrator is expected to announce his decision in the rodriguez case in early###january , and tanaka could very well be elsewhere by then unless he prefers to wait for the yankees . for now , in signing mccann and ellsbury , the yankees have added players who should significantly###improve their lineup . as of wednesday###night , they were still working out the final details on ellsbury 's contract . he will get seven years with a team option for an eighth or a 5 million###buyout , making the guaranteed figure 153 million . he was also granted a full no trade clause .
for the fourth###straight world###cup cycle , the united###states national###team defeated mexico by the same score . this 2 0 victory in columbus , ohio , was arguably the most impressive as it clinched a spot in the 2014 world###cup and jeopardized the chances for its archrival . on the heels of a disappointing###loss to costa###rica , in which it lost jozy###altidore , geoff###cameron , and matt###besler to suspensions as well as perhaps its best player , michael###bradley , to injury , the u.s team put forth a hard fought effort to earn a victory . when honduras played panama to a draw later in the night , the u.s team officially secured its seventh###straight appearance in the world###cup . mexico , who fired###head###coach jos###manuel de la###torre on saturday and replaced him with luis###fernando###tena , dominated the first 15 minutes but had little to show for it . as the first half progressed , the u.s became more effective as the central###midfield pairing of kyle###beckerman and jermaine###jones settled into the game . also , the central defense tandem of omar###gonzalez and clarence###goodson continuously stifled the mexican attack with ease throughout the night . goodson was added to the roster on saturday by coach jurgen klinsmann but his veteran presence turned out to be vital in holding mexico scoreless . the top story of the game , however , was unquestionably landon###donovan . he has been a nemesis to the mexican team ever since his goal in the round of 16 at the 2002 world###cup , when he helped lift the u.s team to a quarterfinal appearance . on monday , he was once again dominant , assisting on the first goal and scoring the second . mexico 's chances to qualify are now in jeopardy . historically , mexico has been the most powerful team in concacaf , but now it finds itself in a battle for fourth###place just to make a playoff in november against new zealand for one of the final world###cup spots . the ratings ( on a scale of , diabolical to , world###class tim###howard recently , there have been doubts whether howard was a guaranteed starter because backup brad###guzan has been playing so well for aston###villa . against mexico , howard again showed why he is klinsmann 's first choice as keeper . the u.s team came out flat in the first half but howard 's saves on giovanni dos santos in the 43rd minute and on diego reyes in the 45th kept the u.s in the game . rating 7.5 fabian johnson playing for just the second time with the u.s team at right back , johnson looked uneasy . he tried to push forward but was never able to deliver a dangerous final pass . defensively , he was caught out of position a few times . he left the game at the half with a sore hamstring . rating 5 . 0clarence goodson after being left off the initial roster for this round of world###cup qualifying , goodson was added saturday as an injury replacement . he seized the opportunity and played one of the best games of his career . he was rock solid defensively and mexico rarely looked dangerous in the second half . he made a strong case that he should be on the team heading to brazil next year . rating 7.5 omar###gonzalez similarly to goodson , gonzalez put forth an impressive effort to all but ensure he will be on the u.s team at next year 's world###cup . gonzalez was sharp breaking up attacks and won most 50 50 balls in his area . rating 7.5 damarcus###beasley after a difficult outing on friday against costa###rica , beasley was vastly improved at left back against mexico . he struggled in the opening minutes and nearly mishit a clearance for an own goal but gradually found his way into the game . the mexican attack rarely had any success on his side in the second half . rating 6.0 jermaine###jones it was a rough first 20 minutes for jones but he gradually found his way into the game . in the second half he was controlling the midfield both offensively###and###defensively . this was one of his best performances in world###cup qualifying . rating 7 . 0kyle beckerman it was not an easy task to fill in for michael###bradley but beckerman did a solid job . he forced turnovers and limited mexico 's ability to attack up the middle of the field . his crisp passing helped the u.s maintain###possession . he was one of several players who made a statement to be part of the team moving###forward . rating 7.5
home###buyers purchasing energy efficient properties could qualify for larger mortgages than their incomes would normally allow under a senate bill reintroduced thursday with broad real###estate industry support . the measure would allow lenders to include projected energy###savings from efficiency upgrades when measuring the borrower 's income against expenses and the value of the home against the debt . in addition to giving borrowers larger loans in new purchases and refinancings , it could also lower their interest rates . senator johnny###isakson , a republican from georgia who worked in the real###estate industry for 33 years and introduced the bill with senator michael###bennet , a democrat from colorado , said that consumers should get credit for energy saving construction###materials , which are often out of sight and out of mind and are not valued . decreasing the amount of energy a home uses , he said in an interview , increases the amount of dollars in the pockets of the homeowners . the government already promotes so called energy efficient mortgages under a department of housing###and###urban###development program . but the proposed###legislation would require lenders to take the projected energy###savings into account when presented with a qualified energy report . the senators originally introduced the bill in , and although it attracted support from groups across a broad political###spectrum including the united###states###chamber###of###commerce and the center###for###american###progress it failed to gain###approval . the sponsors have broadened its appeal within the real###estate industry , chiefly by eliminating provisions that could have penalized older , less efficient homes or those lacking a report based on estimated energy###consumption . how the bill will fare this time around is unclear . its proponents in the senate say they are hopeful it could pass , possibly as part of a comprehensive energy bill introduced by senator jeanne###shaheen , a democrat from new hampshire , and senator rob###portman , a republican from ohio . the proponents say the changes could curtail energy use , reduce###greenhouse###gas###emissions and increase the market for conservation upgrades . the legislation would apply to loans guaranteed by the federal###agencies that collectively back roughly 90 percent of new mortgages . in the absence of a home energy report , which would come from an approved third party inspector , the home 's energy use would not become a factor . but lenders would provide applicants with information about the benefits of investing in energy saving upgrades and counsel them on how they could go about doing so . really we 're just talking about disclosure here , sean babington , legislative###counsel on energy and natural###resources for senator bennet , said in an interview . for years you 've had to disclose if there are termites in your house or if you have radon gas in your basement . you bring an inspector out to make sure the foundation 's not cracked . here we have something that probably over the life of the home costs the homeowner orders of magnitude more than all those problems , and we totally ignore it . according to senator bennet 's office , a household 's average energy costs can run to more than , 000 over the life of a 30 year loan , more than the real###estate taxes and insurance payments that are already taken into account during the underwriting process . investments in insulated hollow###core doors , double pane###windows and insulated floor joist systems above crawl spaces can reduce the average home 's bill by at least 30 percent , a value that does not always translate into a higher purchase###price . jonathan j . miller , the president of miller samuel , an appraisal firm , said the consensus in the real###estate market was that people want green , but to date they have n't been willing to pay for it to the extent of what it costs . if passed , proponents say , the proposal could help close that gap , in addition to promoting energy###conservation and construction jobs , generating . 1 billion a year in savings for consumers by . loan applicants could expect to gain about 5 percent more borrowing power on average , said cliff majersik , executive###director of the institute for market transformation , a nonprofit group that promotes energy###efficiency in buildings and helped###shape the proposal . many people buy what they can qualify for and no more and no less , he said . there are 2 trillion in mortgage###loans that happen every year , and the fact that you have this big blind###spot is an enormous impediment to energy###efficiency .
san###jose , calif . the san###jose###sharks and los###angeles###kings have followed a familiar pattern for six games the home###team scores first on the way to the win . after using that formula to force a decisive seventh###game in their second round series , the sharks know they need to reverse the trend if they want to advance to the western###conference###finals for the third time in four years . it 's followed the script . home###team wins back and forth , sharks coach todd###mclellan said . it 's time for us to get there and try to change the story . we 're going to have to play a much better game than we did last time in that building . but they earned the right for home###ice . it 's our job to take it away from them . joe###thornton got san###jose off to a fast###start with a power###play###goal in the first period and tj galiardi added a goal in the second to set up a winner take all game in this all california series . antti###niemi made 24 saves as the sharks earned their third 2 1 home###win of the series . we wanted this opportunity , said joe###pavelski , who set up thornton 's goal . we wanted to go play . we feel like we 've###played some good games there before . it 's been a while since we 've won , so we 're due . game 7 is tuesday###night in los###angeles . while the kings seemingly have the advantage of home###ice that has been so paramount this series , road teams in nhl history are 8 8 in seventh games of series where the home###team has won the first six games , according to stats . dustin###brown scored the lone goal for los###angeles and jonathan###quick made 24 saves . the kings have lost 11 of 12 road games but have been unbeatable at home , winning all six playoff###games and 13 straight at staples###center since the end of the regular###season . it 's come down to one game , forward mike###richards said . we 're a confident , comfortable team at home . the fans are loud and behind us . it should be an exciting game . the kings tried to end it in san###jose , putting pressure on niemi early in the final period in search of the equalizer . but they could n't###break through against a strong forecheck late in the game much to the delight of the loud crowd chanting beat la ! beat la ! from the start . los###angeles managed just one shot on goal in the final 50 . after taking a 1 0 lead , the sharks went more than 15 minutes without a shot before regaining their stride early in the second period . galiardi beat quick with a wrist shot from the faceoff circle for his first career###playoff goal to make it 2 0 and san###jose had a chance to break the game open when justin###williams was sent to the box with a double minor for high sticking . but quick and the kings killed off all 4 minutes of power play time and then got back into the game with just over 6 minutes left in the second when brown banked a shot from behind the goal###line off niemi and into the net . every game has been close , kings defenseman rob###scuderi said . i 'm sure it 's not a shock it 's come to a game . i 'm sure both teams did n't want it to go this far . right now , it does n't matter how we win it , just that we win it . the sharks started fast thanks to three early power plays and the desperation of an elimination game to continue the trend in this series of the home###team scoring first when they converted on a two man advantage . with richards already in the box for tripping brent###burns , anze kopitar shot a puck over the glass for a delay of game penalty . san###jose patiently worked the puck around during the 5 on 3 advantage and took the lead when pavelski slid a pass across the goalmouth to thornton , who shot it in from the side of the net to end a drought of 14 dating to the second period in game . the 5 on 3 in the first few minutes was big . we 're just trying to slap down the ice but things like that happen , scuderi said . we were trying to limit their start in this building but that got the fans into it early and that hurt us . the sharks were lucky that lead held up for the period as they were scrambling after that in part because of an injury that knocked defenseman justin braun out for the final 16 minutes of the period . los###angeles took the last eight shots of the period , with niemi making two tough saves to rob trevor###lewis on the power play and also stopping kyle clifford on a rebound in close . the kings also were unlucky , hitting three posts in the period . notes the kings have n't allowed more than three goals in 32 straight playoff###games , starting with last year 's run to the stanley###cup . ... braun returned in the second period . ... niemi got an assist on galiardi 's goal for his first career###playoff point . he joins mike###vernon and evgeni###nabokov as sharks goalies to record a point in the playoffs .
despite two serious safety failures and new questions about the reliability of its lithium###ion###batteries , boeing 's chief###executive said wednesday that he saw no reason to retreat from using the new but volatile technology on its 787 jets . the executive , w . james mcnerney jr . , acknowledged that some airlines had needed to replace the new batteries at a slightly###higher rate than boeing had expected . but he also said that the replacements were related to maintenance###issues rather than safety concerns . mr . mcnerney made the comments in a conference call to discuss the company 's financial###performance . they came a day after all nippon airways , which operates 17 of the new jets , said it had replaced 10 batteries from may through december last year . the new york times reported earlier on wednesday that federal###regulators planned to expand their investigation of a recent fire on one 787 and a smoldering battery on another to seek###information about why the 10 batteries had been replaced . all nippon had told the times that it replaced the batteries after they showed unexpectedly low charges or failed to operate normally . boeing officials have said that maintenance problems could include faster than expected aging , or errors by mechanics in improperly disconnecting the batteries or letting them drain too far . what we know is that the replacement cycle that we 've been experiencing there has been for maintenance reasons , mr . mcnerney said . there is no incident where we 're aware of where a battery has been replaced due to any kind of safety concerns . boeing officials also said that some of the batteries might have needed replacing because built in safeguards had activated to prevent overheating and to keep the drained batteries from being recharged in a risky manner . boeing said that if mechanics had improperly connected a battery , another safeguard would also render the battery unusable . mr . mcnerney said he would not speculate on how long it would take to determine the cause of the battery smoke and fire on the two 787s and how much it would cost the company to fix the problems . aviation analysts have said the worst###case could involve boeing switching back to older and less volatile battery technologies , like nickel cadmium , to restore###confidence among air travelers . but mr . mcnerney said , nothing we 've###learned has told us that we made the wrong choice on the battery technology . he added a moment later that none of the investigative findings causes us to question that decision at this stage . investigators for the national###transportation###safety###board and their japanese counterparts have said they have not found anything that could explain the two incidents on the planes . battery experts said they could understand why investigators would want to closely review information about how the batteries have performed on all 50 787s delivered so far and why some were replaced . everybody is in favor of safeguards , said donald r . sadoway , a professor of material chemistry at the massachusetts###institute###of###technology . and the batteries could be fine as manufactured , and tested and perform in excess of specifications . but in service they could develop some weakness , he added . that 's hard to find out . that 's dynamics . that 's like looking at the grapes and trying to find out what the wine will taste like . ralph j . brodd , a battery industry consultant in henderson , nev . , said lithium###ion###batteries needed safeguards in cases where they were discharged too completely because materials inside the batteries are more flammable than in nickel cadmium batteries , which contain water that can prevent overheating . since the 787s are the first boeing planes that use the new technology , he said it would prudent for the airline to replace batteries about which it had concerns . separately on wednesday , japanese investigators who inspected kanto aircraft instrument , the manufacturer of a unit that monitors the lithium###ion###batteries , told###reporters that they had advised the company to make several improvements on quality###assurance but had found nothing that appeared related to the recent problems .
crow###agency , mont . worlds away from washington , audrey costa wondered aloud about keeping her family warm . a mother of three , she relies on lease payments from the bureau###of###indian###affairs on land owned by her family , which can run up to a few hundred dollars a year , to pay for food and electricity . but since the partial shutdown of the federal###government began on oct . 1 , ms . costa , 41 , has not received a check . we 're having such a hard time , she said outside her tattered clapboard home in this poor prairie town deep in the heart of the crow reservation . i do n't know what i 'll do . just tough it out , i guess . like other largely impoverished indian###tribes that lean heavily on federal dollars , the crow have been battered by the shutdown . some 364 crow members , more than a third of the tribe 's work force , have been furloughed . a bus###service , the only way some crow are able to travel across their . 3 million acre reservation , has been shuttered . a home###health###care program for sick tribal members has been suspended . though the tribe has enough money to keep a skeleton government operating for now , it is running out . they do n't have a clue what 's going on out here , the tribal###chairman , darrin old coyote , said of politicians in washington from his office in crow###agency , which sits in the shadows of the little bighorn battlefield , itself closed because of the shutdown . it is hurting a lot of people . the bureau###of###indian###affairs , which provides a vast sweep of services for more than . 7 million american indians and alaska###natives , has kept essential programs , like federal police and firefighting services , running . but it has stopped financing tribal governments and the patchwork of programs and grants that form the thin blanket of support for reservations racked by poverty and other ills . you 're already looking at a good number of tribes who are considered the poorest of our nation 's people , said jacqueline pata , the executive###director of the national###congress###of###american###indians . when you are dealing with cutting off food###supply programs and even nominal payments to tribal members , it creates a dangerous impact immediately . the yurok tribe in northern###california , for example , relies almost solely on federal financing to operate . its reservation , which spans parts of humboldt and del###norte counties , already has an 80 percent unemployment###rate , said susan masten , the tribal vice###chairwoman . with money suddenly unavailable , the tribe has furloughed 60 of its 310 employees , closed its child###care###center and halted emergency financial###assistance for low income and older###members . financing for an environmental program that ensures clean###drinking###water on the reservation is running###low . a second round of furloughs could affect tribal police###officers , ms . masten said . the saddest thing about this is that the federal###government has an obligation to the tribes , she said . in times like this , where it 's already extremely###difficult , any further damage to our budget would be devastating . on the reservation of the red lake band of chippewa indians in northern###minnesota , all nonemergency medical###procedures have been placed on hold , said dave conner , a tribal official who helps manage the red lake 's government services . the red lake were supposed to have received about 1 million from the bureau###of###indian###affairs this month to help operate their government , but the money was not released before the shutdown , mr . conner said . the tribe has budgeted enough money to keep the most critical services running until the end of the month . this is a poor , rural , isolated reservation , mr . conner said . a lot of people rely on our services , so there 's a lot of fear right now . for some tribes , the pain of the shutdown has been sharpened by federal budget###restrictions this year , known as sequestration , that imposed 5 percent cuts to the bureau###of###indian###affairs and the indian###health###service . aaron payment , the chairman of the sault tribe of chippewa indians in michigan , said his tribe had already shut down its h.i.v . prevention###program and furloughed employees for its head###start###program for a month because of sequestration . now , with nearly 1 million in federal money lost since the shutdown , the tribe is scrambling to shift casino revenue from other programs to keep its government afloat . we 're in turmoil right now , mr . payment said . the impact here is going to be felt by the people who need the services the most . kevin washburn , assistant###secretary for indian###affairs , said the shutdown could have long###term effects on tribes and tribal members . financial deals and economic###programs have been suspended . environmental reviews of tribal projects will be delayed . and the impact on the thousands of bureau###of###indian###affairs employees who have been furloughed is compounded because many support poor relatives , he said . the cushion that tribes might have had to help them get through tough###times is gone because of sequestration , mr . washburn said . in hardin , mont . , a gritty reservation border town , presina grant has been caring for her sister , who broke both of her wrists in a fall . until recently , ms . grant , who is crow , had been reimbursed 8 an hour as part of the tribe 's health###care program . but after the program was suspended because of the shutdown , ms . grant , 43 , found herself in a long line of other tribal members applying for food###stamps . her daughter is a high###school cross###country###runner and craves nutrition . but with money tight , she often must feed her three children frozen###food . everyone was just sad you could just feel it , ms . grant said , recalling the day this month when she collected her final paycheck from the tribe . people are worried . we 're praying every day .
boston it will be at least another month , perhaps in a first round###playoff series , before declarations can be made , or conclusions drawn , or torches passed or wrested away . after five years of pre###eminence , the boston###celtics have at least earned a withholding of judgment until the games really matter . but the ground continued to shift beneath them tuesday###night , the balance of power tilting ever more sharply , unmistakably , southward . the knicks cruised to a 100 85 victory at td###garden and inched ever closer to taking the atlantic###division crown that the celtics have owned for the last five years . it was the knicks' fifth straight###victory , the celtics' fifth straight###loss , and it left a seven and a half game gap between them , with 13 games to play . we want to beat them , let 's just be quite frank about it , carmelo###anthony said , after scoring 29 points in the win . we always want to beat boston . new york in anything wants to beat boston . and when we do , it 's a great feeling . the knicks ( 43 26 ) have a 2 1 edge in the season series , having won twice in boston for the first time since . they meet once more on sunday at madison###square###garden , with the knicks poised to win the series for the first time in nine years . so although neither team was at full strength , the symbolism tuesday was striking . the knicks thrived on the one two punch of anthony and j . r . smith ( 32 points , who took turns carving up the celtics' suddenly lax defense . they pounced early and held a double###digit lead for most of the second half . jeff green led the celtics with 19 points . paul###pierce , the celtics' only healthy star , hardly made an impact , scoring just 16 points , and the celtics sabotaged themselves with 20 turnovers . the celtics ( 36 34 ) could conceivably revive themselves in the postseason and make another storied run . at the moment , they are slotted seventh and on course to face the knicks in the first round . but boston is just a game and a half ahead of milwaukee and could easily slip to eighth , setting up an almost impossible first round###matchup with the miami###heat . with kevin###garnett and courtney###lee both resting injured ankles , the celtics looked disoriented and discouraged . garnett is out for at least two weeks , which means he will miss sunday 's rematch as well . it 's been like that for us all season long , pierce said . it just seems like it gets worse and worse . but like i said , we ca n't###feel sorry for ourselves . the knicks were also missing their defensive anchor , tyson###chandler , who missed his seventh###straight game because of a bulging disk in his neck . but kenyon###martin continued to make a strong###impression in chandler 's place , anchoring the defense , slamming put back dunks and generally punishing the celtics , one of the teams that passed on signing him this season . there were discussions between the celtics and martin 's representatives , but no contract was ever offered , and martin joined the knicks in february . with garnett ailing , the celtics surely looked like they could use martin 's ferocity in the paint . that 's their fault , martin said . they lost . there was talks , there was negotiations , they chose not to do it . it was out of my control . so i 'm a knick now . so they lost . with no garnett to meet them under the basket , the knicks drove freely and often , scoring 50 points in the paint . smith was blistering from the field in the first half and finished 13 for 24 from the field , again showing off a nice mix of drives and jumpers . he was timely , too after jason###terry 's 3 pointer cut the lead to 12 points in the final###seconds of the third , smith raced downcourt , pulled up from 29 feet and drilled the shot as the buzzer sounded . barring an untimely slump or another knee###injury the knicks seem primed to claim their first division title in 19 years , fulfilling one of coach mike###woodson 's stated###goals . when it 's all said and done , hopefully we 'll be hanging a division banner up there , because that 's what it 's all about , woodson said , though he quickly noted that the championship was the primary###goal . we have a long way to go before we reach that goal , he said . but you got to set many goals along the way , and winning your division puts you in a position to host first round at home . boston 's five year dominance is almost certainly over . but then , no one here has ever been particularly focused on minor achievements there are no atlantic###division pennants hanging among the 18 championship banners in the td###garden rafters . they 're nice to have , i guess , coach doc###rivers said . but it 's not what you should be playing for . tyson###chandler thought he had a chance to return to the lineup tuesday i felt like i was close but he reconsidered after his neck stiffened up monday , hours after a light workout . i knew that i probably was n't###ready , late###afternoon , because i started to have some of the same symptoms , which continued into tuesday###morning , chandler said . i knew right away that i was n't quite there . although the pain is manageable , chandler is having difficulty turning his neck and looking up , which would make it difficult to play defense and rebound . chandler said

washington for couples who plan to get hitched at the courthouse here , marital bliss may be tempered by the government###shutdown . the family###court marriage bureau will not perform weddings until the government reopens , according to the district of columbia courts , although couples will still be able to file marriage###license applications and pick up licenses they had previously applied for . shutdown related disruptions have been kept at a minimum in the nation 's capital so far because mayor vincent c . gray has deemed all city employees essential and protected from furlough . but the courts are run###separately by the joint###committee on judicial###administration . the decision not to perform weddings comes after the courts expanded the marriage bureau in september to meet the increase in demand that followed the supreme###court 's ruling that struck down a federal law depriving same sex couples of federal benefits . washington raises its own revenues , but its spending requires congressional###approval that is cut off by the shutdown . mr . gray says the city has enough money in its emergency reserves to pay###salaries for only about two weeks . house republicans did not include the courts in a bill approved on wednesday that would allow financing to resume for the district of columbia . the measure lacked substantial###support from democrats and is likely to die in the senate despite a plea from the city 's nonvoting delegate , eleanor###holmes###norton , to keep the district open . despite the impasse , some court functions continue juveniles must report for probation hearings , and the courts will accept filings and payments . residents will still have jury###duty , too . trials are essential , according to a twitter message from the courts .
paris it is a measure of serena###williams 's form whether her news conferences focus on the match just finished or on broader topics . on wednesday###night , the first question was about the legacy of althea###gibson , and the dialogue only rarely focused on the particulars of williams 's latest victory . how much was there truly to be said about her , 6 2 drubbing of the french 19 year old caroline garcia ? garcia was once identified as a future no . 1 in the world by the british star andy###murray , but she clearly is not yet ready to do much damage to the current no . 1 . that would be williams , who has now won 26 matches in a row and dropped only four games in two matches at the french###open , with sorana cirstea up next . williams lost in the first round here last year to virginie###razzano . but this year the drama has been elsewhere in the first week at roland garros . there was the continuing struggle of caroline###wozniacki , the former no . 1 who is now in the midst of a deepening slump and was beaten in the second round by bojana###jovanovski , an unseeded serb . clay has never been the 10th seeded wozniacki 's favorite surface . she thrives on hardcourts , but she has now lost six of her last seven matches all on clay and has lost to jovanovski twice in that stretch . wozniacki is once again considering options other than her father , piotr , as coach . there was also the poignant sight of the promising 18 year old american madison keys leaving the court in the gloaming in tears and unsuccessfully fighting to hold them back later as she discussed her second round loss to monica###puig of puerto###rico . i mean it was raining , and it was dark , but i have to deal with it , keys said . puig , 19 , is like keys a teenager participating in her first french###open . the two played in the junior###ranks , but the stakes are considerably###higher now . and while puig was radiant as she answered###questions about her third round###match to come against carla###su###rez###navarro of spain , keys sat in a big armchair and struggled to come to terms with the , 7 6 ( 2 ) defeat . this one hurts more than the others , keys said . i just feel like i did n't###play my best . i felt if i played my best , it probably would n't have hurt as bad . now for the good news her clay###court season is over . getting there , but still not my favorite surface , especially on days like this where balls are heavy and everything is even slower , keys said . it totally plays against me .. keys , who already has one of the most powerful serves in women 's tennis , will now play her first full grass###court season , and plans to play a heavy###schedule in nottingham , birmingham , eastbourne and then wimbledon . hey , if it 's faster than clay , i 'm happy , keys said .
south###bend , ind . the camera panned across the lush , green , irish landscape , when a voice came from off screen . they said they have mooses out here , the voice said . that excited louis nix iii , the notre###dame nose guard known as irish chocolate , who was the cameraman and star of a youtube series titled chocolate news . i 'll go pet a moose , he said in response . i feel like they have a moose petting###zoo out here that 's how nice it is . i do n't know who would like to go pet a moose , but me ? i would pet a moose in ireland . he suddenly###turned the camera on himself , his mouth momentarily filling the screen . because we 're in ireland , we pet mooses around here , he said . you feel me ? this was nix in rare form in search of a moose to pet before the team 's season###opener in ireland . this was why irish chocolate is a celebrity of sorts among classmates and die###hard alumni . and this was , essentially , why nix has not made an episode since . things were going well , man , nix said last month , his voice dropping , his eyes drooping . we were trying to stay###focused . amid notre###dame 's undefeated###season , one that has landed it in monday 's bowl###championship###series title game against alabama , there was apparently no time for chocolate news , a five episode distillation of nix 's irrepressible personality . no time to scold teammates for poor choices at the grocery###store , no time to interview coach brian###kelly after back surgery , no time to swing a golf###club worse than charles###barkley . no time to broadcast his irish chocolate adventures . nix was a tad busy pressuring quarterbacks and occupying blockers trying to reach linebackers manti###te'o and stephon tuitt , who were all americans . te'o , who finished second in the heisman###trophy voting , said he would have cast his ballot for nix . and tuitt credited nix 's irish chocolate persona for keeping the team loose , like a great clown among children . but nix insists he is serious now . kelly may sometimes call him chocolate thunder , and his teammates may call him just plain chocolate , or sweet lou , but nix has matured , his coaches say . he is still irish chocolate , but he 's found a nice blend , said his position coach , mike elston . nix still fires quips as fast as his first step . his observational banter is uncensored and honest , like his on field advice . his best work is instinctive . i 've always taken what i did seriously , nix said , but at a slower###pace . he first committed to notre###dame when it had no coach after charlie###weis had been fired and before kelly arrived . he found it preposterous that his future should depend on a coach , and not a university . then he reported to camp overweight at 368 pounds . nix was embarrassed . he finished near the back during team sprints , sat as a freshman , started 11 games last season , and then temporarily lost his starting###spot in spring###practice . he heard coaches whisper he was fit enough for only 15 to 20 plays a game . how much does nix weigh now ? he paused , then with a straight###face said , 300 , causing a group of reporters to laugh . but elston said , in all seriousness , that nix reported to fall camp in the best shape of his life . on the team 's web###site , nix is listed at 326 pounds . his official team photo shows him smiling as wide as he can . when he is playing , that expression disappears . notre###dame center braxston cave , who regularly blocks nix in practice , said , i do n't think i 've ever seen him smile on the field . nix almost certainly was not smiling this season when notre###dame needed to stop stanford twice at its own 1 yard###line in overtime to remain###undefeated . on both plays , the cardinal gave the ball to running back stepfan taylor up the middle , at nix . both times , nix held his own , penetrated through the offensive###line , and , along with te'o and a mob of defenders , stuffed taylor . it 's the last play of the game of a 70 play game , elston said . if he does n't have great stamina and great conditioning , he 's going to be tired , he 's going to get a little bit high , he 's going to get knocked off the ball , he 's not going to have the energy to get off the block .
washington the widow of a united###airlines pilot who died on sept . 11 , 2001 , is lobbying for legislation that would require airlines to install a second security door to prevent would be hijackers from rushing cockpits . but the move is opposed by the airline###industry , which says the existing security###measures are good enough . ellen saracini , whose husband , victor , was the captain on the hijacked united flight , which crashed into the world###trade###center 's south tower , said she learned in august that united had begun removing the secondary security doors from newer planes . she began###lobbying congress this year , making trips to washington from her home in yardley , pa . it 's quite upsetting to me , ms . saracini said in an interview . when victor and the others died , united did the right thing and added these doors . now they are backsliding . after the 2001 attacks , congress required airlines to install reinforced cockpit doors that could withstand gunfire and explosives . some airlines , united in particular , went further by installing retractable , fencelike barriers between the cockpit and the outer security door . but pilots who work for united say the airline , which merged with continental in , is removing the doors to save###money . the pilots say they believe that continental , which runs the new company created in the merger , ordered the doors removed because its planes had no doors and it did not want to have to put doors in all the merged company 's planes about , 000 in all . the secondary doors are believed to cost , 000 to , 000 each . united declined to comment on the doors . it is unclear how many of them remain in the planes . ms . saracini is supported by the air###line###pilots association and the federal law###enforcement###officers association , which represents officers from various federal###agencies , including the transportation###security###administration and the secret###service . a bipartisan coalition of 22 lawmakers , mostly from states where the hijacked planes crashed on sept . 11 , have taken up the cause . they have introduced a bill , the saracini aviation safety act , that would force airlines to install secondary barriers . the bill has been referred to the house###transportation###committee . representative michael g . fitzpatrick , republican of pennsylvania , the bill 's main###sponsor and ms . saracini 's congressman , said he had made several attempts to get answers from united about the removal of the second doors and other security###measures . they have given some vague answers about security###measures they have , basically saying , 'just trust us , ' mr . fitzpatrick said . the bill that i 'm sponsoring simply fulfills the intent of the efforts that were started over a decade###ago by adding another layer of protection . pilots and law###enforcement officials say the current security doors do protect cockpits from attacks except when pilots open the doors for bathroom breaks or meals , which they say would give a well trained group of terrorists a five second opening to breach the cockpit . with two doors , pilots and law###enforcement officials say , when a pilot leaves the cockpit , he can close one behind him before opening the door to the rest of the plane . airline###industry and law###enforcement officials , who asked not to be quoted , said there have been at least 11 attempts worldwide by individuals to get into a cockpit since the sept . 11 attacks . the officials said they could not say if any of the attempts had been in the united###states . the federal###aviation###administration and the t.s.a. , agencies with oversight of airline security , have acknowledged that the secondary security doors provide###additional safety . an f.a.a . report in 2011 concluded that of all the security###measures including human barriers and galley carts placed before the doors the secondary doors were the most cost###effective , efficient and safest way to protect the cockpit . the agency declined to make the doors mandatory . a spokeswoman for the f.a.a . said the agency would review any legislation on the secondary security doors but would not require them unless directed to do so . most airlines contacted said they did not have the secondary barrier doors and had no plans to install them . installing a secondary barrier door to the cockpit of our aircraft is not in the current plans for our fleet , said michelle agnew , a spokeswoman for southwest###airlines . delta###air###lines did not respond to questions about the secondary security doors . in , northwest###airlines , which has since merged with delta , installed secondary doors on some flights but decided against installing them on all the planes in its fleet . although united###airlines did not address specific###questions about the removal of the doors , a spokeswoman said the airline took the safety and security of its customers and workers seriously . security###measures have evolved in the years since the secondary barriers were ordered , and many more layers of security now exist on each of our aircraft , said christen david , the spokeswoman . while we do n't discuss the details of which security###measures are used for a particular aircraft or a particular flight , we are thorough in carrying out our security responsibilities for every flight . airlines do not disclose their security###measures , but f.a.a . documents and interviews with pilots show that the measures include positioning flight###attendants in front of a door or in some cases placing a food###cart in front of the cockpit door . i would n't even call that security , said jon adler , president of the law enforcement union . ms . saracini said the secondary doors were a small price to pay to prevent another terrorist attack . i 'm not doing this for victor . i ca n't help him , she said . i 'm doing this so no one else will have to suffer through what my two girls and i had to suffer through .

washington senator tim###johnson , the south###dakota democrat who suffered a major brain###hemorrhage a month after his party retook the senate in 2006 and recovered enough to run again two years later , announced tuesday that he would not seek###re###election in . i will be 68 years old at the end of this term and it 's time for me to say goodbye , mr . johnson said during a brief news conference in vermillion , s.d . after thanking his family and staff he added the bible says that there is a time for every season under heaven . it is now our season to spend more time with our six grandchildren and in the state we love . mr . johnson 's decision , coming on the heels of a spate of retirement announcements from democrats , opens up a potential new opportunity for republicans in the state that president###obama lost by a large margin last year . further , the retirement of mr . johnson , a moderate who is chairman of the powerful banking committee , will open up that slot , should democrats maintain a majority . his replacement could be critical as congress continues to deal with regulatory###issues . senators carl###levin of michigan , tom###harkin of iowa , frank r . lautenberg of new jersey and john d . rockefeller iv of west###virginia , all democrats , have said they will not seek###re###election . two republicans , senators saxby###chambliss of georgia and mike###johanns of nebraska , have also said they will not run . republicans , who are hoping that 2014 will finally be their year after two opportunities to take back the senate###majority have slipped from their fingers , are eying mr . johnson 's seat eagerly . south###dakota voters rejected the liberal agenda by nearly 20 points in , and it 's a prime pick up opportunity for republicans regardless of whose name ends up on the ballot , said senator jerry###moran of kansas , who is chairman of the national###republican###senatorial###committee . former gov . mike###rounds , a republican , had already planned to challenge mr . johnson . another possible contender would be representative kristi###noem , who came in on a republican wave in . senator michael###bennet of colorado , chairman of the democratic###senatorial###campaign###committee , thanked mr . johnson for making his decision early enough to allow his party to mount a strong###defense of the seat . mr . johnson 's success has been a thing of wonder since almost the beginning of his senate career . after serving in the house for five terms , mr . johnson was elected to the senate in , winning by two percentage###points in an expensive race for the low cost state . in 2002 he ran again , beating john###thune ( who went on to win a senate###seat in 2004 ) by a mere 524 votes of more than , 000 cast , and focused largely on agricultural issues , taking moderate positions along an array of issues . in , just a month after ascending to new powers with his party 's victory , he suffered a brain###hemorrhage from which he struggled to recover , threatening his party 's fragile majority . in 2008 he ran again and won after proving that , with slurred###speech and the frequent use of a scooter to ferry him around the capitol , he could still manage his senate career . among democrats in south###dakota who could succeed him , the greatest speculation centers on mr . johnson 's son brendan and former representative stephanie###herseth###sandlin , who was defeated by ms . noem and has kept a relatively low###profile since but remains###popular in the state . i 've not discussed in detail what comes next , whether it 's stephanie or brendan or whatever , mr . johnson said , in response to questions about whom he would like to see succeed him .
one obstacle president###obama may face in proposing a new federal ban on assault###weapons could lie in the use of the term assault###weapon itself . the label , applied to a group of firearms sold on the civilian market , has become so politicized in recent###decades that where people stand on the gun issue can often be deduced by whether they use the term . on internet###forums there is perhaps no more fiercely discussed###topic than the question of what constitutes an assault###weapon . and some argue that it would be impossible to come up with a definition comprehensive enough to effectively remove the weapons from the market . advocates of an assault###weapons###ban argue that the designation should apply to firearms like those used in the newtown , conn . , shootings and other recent mass###killings semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines and military features like pistol###grips , flash suppressors and collapsible or folding stocks . such firearms , they contend , were designed for the battlefield , where the goal is to rapidly kill as many enemy###soldiers as possible , and they have no place in civilian life . when the military switched over to this assault###weapon , the whole context changed , said tom diaz , formerly of the violence policy center , whose book about the militarization of civilian firearms , the last gun , is scheduled for publication in the spring . the conversation became , 'is this the kind of gun you want in the civilian world ? ' and we who advocate for regulation say , 'no , you do not . ' but second amendment groups and many firearm owners heatedly object to the use of assault###weapon to describe guns that they say are routinely used in target shooting and hunting . the term , they argue , should be used only for firearms capable of full automatic fire , like those employed by law enforcement and the military . they prefer the term tactical rifle or modern sporting rifle for the semiautomatic civilian versions . they argue that any attempt to ban assault###weapons is misguided because the guns under discussion differ from many other firearms only in their styling . the reality is there 's very little difference between any sporting firearm and a so called assault###weapon , said steven c . howard , a lawyer and firearms expert in lansing , mich . the semantics of the assault###weapon debate are so fraught that they can trip up even those who oppose a ban . phillip peterson , a gun###dealer in indiana and the author of gun digest buyer 's guide to assault###weapons , said he had fought with his publishers over the use of the term in the title , knowing that it would only draw the ire of the gun industry . after the passage of the 1994 federal ban on assault###weapons , mr . peterson said , the gun industry moved to shame or ridicule anyone who used assault###weapon to describe anything other than firearms capable of full automatic fire . his instinct proved###correct the national###rifle###association refused to sell the book on its web###site , he said . so in , mr . peterson produced another version that contained 90 percent of the same info , but was retitled gun digest buyer 's guide to tactical rifles . that book made it onto the n.r.a . site , he said . equally controversial are the definitions for which firearms should qualify as assault###weapons . most assault###weapons bans have been primarily aimed at rifles like the ar , a semiautomatic version of the military 's m 16 sold on the civilian market , although certain pistols and shotguns have also been included . the most basic criteria have to do with a firearm 's ability to fire multiple###rounds quickly . because of this , the firearms included under any assault###weapons###ban are usually semiautomatic , meaning that a new round is automatically reloaded into the chamber but is not fired until the trigger is pulled again . the weapons also have detachable magazines , allowing them to fire , 20 , 30 rounds or more without the need to insert a new magazine . after that , however , the definition becomes more difficult . in calling for a renewed ban , mr . obama on wednesday singled out military style weapons .
boston a year ago , the boston###red###sox opened fenway###park for halloween . children paraded around the warning###track in costumes . there were face painters , magicians and balloon artists . will middlebrooks , rich###gedman and wally the green###monster greeted fans . on thursday , in the early###morning###hours of oct . 31 , fenway was open again . for a while , in the celebration after the final out of the world###series , a low lying haze enveloped the field , like the mist from a graveyard on a spooky autumn night . it was fitting for an exorcism . when the fireworks went off at the presentation of the trophy out there , when the ballpark was filled with smoke , it was completely surreal , manager john###farrell said . to be in this position , given where we 've come from , reflecting back a year ago at this time , there 's been a lot that 's happened in 13 months . in a storybook season , the red###sox proved that the ghoulish events from september 2011 through september 2012 really were just a blip in a decade of dominance . they parted with two managers and a general###manager , choked away a playoff###spot and crash landed in last place in the american###league###east . now , they have captured their third championship in 10 seasons . there 's a lot of people in the organization , certainly players , but others ownership , people in the front office that went through some tough###times , general###manager ben###cherington said on the field after the game 6 victory . we earned some scrutiny , we earned some criticism , and i 'm very happy for the group that kind of lived through that and tonight can enjoy a much happier day . farrell did not live through it . he endured his own struggles in toronto , guiding the blue###jays to two lackluster seasons ( 154 170 ) in his first experience as a manager . even so , the red###sox desperately sought him to turn around a team that disintegrated under bobby###valentine , who had no history in the organization . farrell did . he was the pitching coach under terry###francona from 2007 to , and before that spent five years as director of player development for the cleveland###indians . those jobs , along with his background as a former major###league pitcher , made farrell especially qualified for a high###profile franchise with strong front office convictions and pitchers who craved stability . the red###sox traded an infielder , mike aviles , to toronto for the rights to farrell . phenomenal , a plus , larry###lucchino , the president of the red###sox , said of farrell . he did it in a very active , productive collaboration with ben###cherington and baseball operations . there was a connectedness that was very , very real , and that was another important###lesson . only seven managers have switched###teams and required compensation , and farrell is the third to win a world###series with his new team . the others were gil###hodges , who went from the washington###senators to the mets for pitcher bill denehy and cash , and chuck###tanner , who went from oakland to pittsburgh for catcher manny sanguillen . hodges won the 1969 world###series , and tanner won a decade later . cherington deflected a question about whether he would have hired farrell after the 2011 collapse , if the blue###jays had let him . it does not matter now , and for all the pain of , the red###sox probably would change nothing about the way it all unfolded . their flop a year ago allowed for a franchise reset made possible by a trade with the los###angeles###dodgers , who eagerly took on some 260 million in salaries for josh###beckett , carl###crawford and adrian###gonzalez . all three had grown to see boston as a burden , and cherington , once they were gone , imported seven free###agents who embraced the red###sox as an opportunity . to lead them , though , he needed farrell . nobody had questioned valentine 's work ethic or intellect . but the sideshows had to stop , and in farrell , cherington had a lieutenant he could trust fully .
set in 1915 on the c###te###d'azur , where renoir ( michel###bouquet , crippled with arthritic pain , lived out his final###years , the gorgeous film visualizes the world as observed by an enfeebled artist who is kept alive by his obsession with how the skin of a beautiful###woman absorbs light . the movies were still in their infancy when this film takes###place , four years before renoir 's death , at . as the art form matured , french cinema in particular inherited renoir 's fascination with the radiance and mutability of the flesh and the mysteries in the folds and textures of the female###form . women 's exalted place in gallic cinema is evidenced by the number of films with formidable female###characters in the 2013 rendez###vous with french cinema series , presented by the film###society###of###lincoln###center and unifrance beginning thursday . the series , now in its 18th year , has screenings at lincoln###center , the ifc###center and bamcin matek . renoir is the conceptual springboard for this year 's series , which honors the films of the great filmmaker jean###renoir , the second of the painter 's three sons and the author of a 1962 biography of his father . three of the son 's masterworks are being shown his first color film , the river , in a restored###print a digital restoration of his satire boudu saved from drowning and the rules of the game , a perennial contender on critics' polls for the finest film ever made . jean###renoir ( vincent rottiers ) figures in the new biopic as well . he returns from the front to recuperate from wounds suffered during world###war i , and the father and son engage in subtle rivalry for the attention of the painter 's latest nude###model , the teenage andr e heuschling ( christa th ret , a spirited , ravishingly beautiful redhead . like the women in renoir 's paintings she seems to emanate radiance from within . without intellectualizing , renoir implies a direct aesthetic connection between the father 's paintings and the son 's films , although pierre###auguste demonstrated little interest in the social###themes that preoccupied jean . renoir is a reminder that in french cinema , female###beauty is regarded as ageless . a prime example is jeanne###moreau , who at 85 remains a symbol of enduring sensuality . in ilmar raag 's film a lady in paris ms . moreau stars as frida , an imperious , independent woman ( not unlike the real###life ms . moreau ) who battles with a caregiver ( laine magi ) employed by frida 's younger , still devoted ex lover ( patrick pineau . the movie

american employers have a variety of job###vacancies , piles of cash and countless well qualified###candidates . but despite a slowly improving economy , many companies remain reluctant to actually hire , stringing job###applicants along for weeks or months before they make a decision . if they ever do . the number of job###openings has increased to levels not seen since the height of the financial###crisis , but vacancies are staying unfilled much longer than they used to an average of 23 business days today compared to a low of 15 in mid , according to a new measure of labor department data by the economists steven j . davis , jason faberman and john haltiwanger . some have attributed the more extended process to a mismatch between the requirements of the four million###jobs available and the skills held by many of the 12 million unemployed . that 's probably true in a few high skilled fields , like nursing or biotech , but for a large majority of positions where candidates are plentiful , the bigger###problem seems to be a sort of hiring paralysis . there 's a fear that the economy is going to go down again , so the message you get from c.f.o . 's is to be careful about hiring someone , said john###sullivan , a management professor at san###francisco###state###university who runs a human###resources consulting###business . there 's this great###fear of making a mistake , of wasting###money in a tight economy . as a result , employers are bringing in large###numbers of candidates for interview after interview after interview . data from glassdoor . com , a site that collects###information on hiring at different companies , shows that the average duration of the interview###process at major companies like starbucks , general###mills and southwest###airlines has roughly###doubled since . after they call you back after the sixth interview , there 's a part of you that wants to say , 'that 's it , i 'm not going back , ' said paul sullivan , 43 , an exasperated but cheerful video editor in washington . but then you think , hey , maybe seven is my lucky###number . and besides , if i do n't go , they 'll just eliminate me if something else comes up because they 'll think i have an attitude problem . like other job###seekers around the country , he has been through marathon interview sessions . mr . sullivan has received eighth and ninth round callbacks for positions at three different companies . two of those companies , as it turned out , ultimately###decided not to hire anyone , he said instead they put their openings on hold because of budget pressures . at one company , while signing into the visitor 's log for the sixth time , he was chided by the security guard . he thought i worked there and just kept forgetting my security badge , mr . sullivan said . he could n't believe i was actually there for another interview . i could n't either ! but then i put on a happy###face , went upstairs and waited for another round of questions . the hiring delays are part of the vicious###cycle the economy has yet to escape jobless and financially stretched americans are reluctant to spend , which holds back demand , which in turn frays employers' confidence that sales will firm up and justify committing to a new hire . job###creation over the last two years has been steady but too slow to put a major dent in the backlog of unemployed###workers , and the february jobs report due out on friday is expected to be equally mediocre . uncertainty about the effect of fiscal###policy in washington is not helping expectations for the rest of the year , either . if you have an opening and are not sure about the economy , it 's pretty cheap to wait for a month or two , said nicholas bloom , an economics professor at stanford###university . but in the aggregate , those little delays , coupled with fiscal uncertainty , are stretching out the recovery###process . it 's like one of those horror###movies , an economic friday the 13th , where this recession never seems to die . employers might be making candidates jump through so many hoops partly because so many workers have been jobless for months or years , and hiring managers want to make sure the candidates' skills are up to date , said robert shimer , an economics professor at the university of chicago . but there 's also little pressure to hire right now , so long as candidates are abundant and existing staff members are afraid to refuse the extra workload created by an unfilled position . employers can keep dragging out the hiring###process until they 're more confident about their business or at least until they find the superstar candidate . they 're chasing after that purple squirrel , said roger ahlfeld , 44 , of framingham , mass . , using a human###resources industry term for an impossibly qualified job applicant .
london sunderland signed italian goalkeeper vito###mannone from premier###league rivals arsenal for an undisclosed###fee on wednesday , moving to replace belgian international simon###mignolet who joined liverpool last month . mannone , 25 , made only 23 appearances in eight years at arsenal , although he started nine premier###league games last season and another four in the champions###league . he links up with compatriot paolo###di###canio , who took charge of sunderland late last season and staved off the threat of relegation , the north###east club finishing one place and three points above the drop###zone . the potential ( of the club ) is incredible , mannone told sunderland 's website ( www . safc . com . i waited a long time for an opportunity like sunderland , and for me it is a great one . i 'm very excited . i am here to work hard and to show what i can do . with mignolet 's departure , mannone will compete for a first team place with ireland international keiren###westwood . of his time at arsenal , he added i had a great experience it was a good learning###curve for me . even if i was probably a bit restricted in terms of opportunities . i learned a lot .
it needs to be said , over and over again , that stan the man was voted by the sporting###news as the best baseball###player of the postwar decade , from 1946 through . these were the late years of dimaggio and feller , the time of williams and robinson , the early###years of mays and aaron . stan the man was considered the best , a potent mix of power and consistency . in the rabid heart of brooklyn , dodgers fans called him that man , endowing him with a nickname that outlasts his passing saturday at . how likable was he ? in the fall of , musial was recruited by john f . kennedy to join a campaign in the midwest . nobody called them red states back then , but there was considerable disdain for the democrats who came spilling off the chartered plane james a . michener , arthur###schlesinger , byron ( whizzer ) white , a couple of kennedy wives , jeff###chandler and angie###dickinson . we were well aware they were against us , the thoughtful dickinson said a few years###ago . that 's why they booed us and threw things at us . that 's why we went to those states . the celebrities were stunned to watch the baseball###player get up front and remind the crowd how he once struck out in that state republicans cheered him . stan the man was loved in clubhouses , too . when i was working on the unauthorized###biography stan###musial an american life , which came out in , old opponents recalled how musial knew their names after they had been in the majors only a few days . he was a lodge member , who acknowledged black players . at all star games , he would see aaron , mays , banks , et al , sitting in a corner , maybe playing a hand or two of cards before batting practice . deal me in , musial would say . his place was with the hitters , and they loved him for that . he had played on a mixed basketball###team back in donora , pa . once in pittsburgh , the hotel put up a screen between the players and other diners . the boys eight white , two black , including buddy griffey of the donora griffeys walked out . in , he declined to strike when some teammates babbled about not taking the field against jackie###robinson . revisionist thought is that musial did not do enough to force the cardinals to hire a black player before . he was not martin###luther###king###jr . , let 's put it that way . he saw robinson , roy###campanella and don###newcombe and told people close to him that the cardinals were done . they would not win a pennant from 1947 until , the year after he retired . we finally got a left###fielder , he said with his giggle . the left###fielder was lou###brock . in those days before cable and the internet , musial was an icon because of clear###channel radio , from the midwest to the south to the southwest . his aura faded over the years , partly because of the inevitability of time , and partly because he lacked some kind of sizzle . he was a family man who put up his own christmas###lights on his ranch house in a modest neighborhood . a friend of mine recalled going to a department###store and seeing stan and his wife , lil , testing the mattresses , bouncing up and down . they were regular citizens in a town that prized approachability . around the country , people forgot . the dimaggio legend included roses on marilyn###monroe 's grave . the williams saga included the crash###landing of a burning jet during the korean###conflict . those men were moody , mysterious , sexy . in , baseball held a gimmick computer printout vote for the top 25 players of the century . the fans du###jour voted for mark###mcgwire , for goodness' sakes , and forgot stan the man , with his . 331 batting###average , 475 home###runs , speed and consistency . fortunately , commissioner bud###selig had mandated a 30 player squad , including five committee choices for just such oversights . musial was the first person included . he never griped . in flyover country , people entertain the theory that news###media strongholds on the coasts are turned off by solid middle###america family guys . musial drew his strength from his childhood in donora , home of the murderous smog on halloween 1948 that killed dozens immediately and hastened the death of musial 's father . lukasz musial , a polish immigrant who worked in the zinc mills , was never comfortable in this new land , but his son , sweet and athletic , found mentors , men who taught him how to dress and shake###hands and look people in the eye . he wanted to have a good life . in later years , he wore suits and ties and read the wall###street###journal in his office at stan###musial biggie 's restaurant . musial wanted to be a businessman , not a figurehead . he knew the cuts of meat the way he knew the repertory of robin###roberts ( against whom he had 10 home###runs , newcombe ( 11 ) and warren###spahn , the most . those pitchers loved him , by the way . in recent###years , musial was visibly slipping , no longer able to gab or play happy###birthday on his ever present harmonica for the ladies who lunch . i anticipated this , and we were fortunate to have him around for 92 years , james j . hackett , the former chief of detectives in st . louis , who lunched regularly with musial , said sunday . but then you think , we 'd like to have him around for another eight . hackett said his pal was deceptively astute about people and business , behind the aw shucks laughter . lil musial , in a wheelchair for 10 years , was still running the household until her death last may . they were well cared for by their four children and many grandchildren . st . louis will know how to say farewell to its most popular citizen , ever . we will be reminded why he was so loved and so respected , the player of a baseball decade , stan the man .

boeing has developed possible fixes for the battery problems in its grounded 787 jets and could have them back in the air within two months , industry and federal officials said wednesday . the officials said boeing has narrowed down the ways the lithium###ion###batteries on the jetliners could fail , and believes that adding insulation between the cells of the batteries and making other changes would provide enough assurance that they would be safe to use . raymond l . conner , the president of boeing 's commercial airplane division , plans to propose the fixes in a friday meeting with michael p . huerta , the head of the federal###aviation###administration . mr . huerta is not expected to approve the changes immediately , but the meeting is likely to start a high###level discussion on the standards boeing needs to meet as it tests the fixes and seeks to get the planes flying again . boeing 's plan could be a pivotal###moment in the history of the innovative fuel efficient planes . mr . huerta and regulators around the world grounded the planes in mid###january after a battery caught fire on one jet parked at the boston airport and smoke forced another 787 to make an emergency###landing in japan . investigators have not determined what caused those problems . but boeing 's engineers have worked###closely with the f.a.a . and outside experts to identify###ways in which the batteries could have failed , and boeing is now asking the government to sign off on a calculation that they have now come up with a safer design . given the risks in moving###ahead , federal officials said , the f.a.a . has insisted behind the scenes that boeing needed to come up with changes to prevent failures at the same time as it proposed further steps to wall off problems with the batteries and vent any smoke or fire outside the planes . boeing officials said they had also hoped to make all the fixes at once rather than dividing them into temporary and longer###term changes . by delaying some changes , boeing could have been exposed to more problems . as a result , one big###change under boeing 's plan would be to redesign the batteries to place insulation inside and around each of the eight cells to minimize the risk that a short###circuit or fire in one of the cells could spread to the others , as investigators have said occurred on the battery that caught fire in boston on jan . 7 . boeing might also adjust how tightly the batteries are packed . boeing would make other changes within the batteries to reduce the chance that vibrations , swelling or moisture could cause problems , industry officials said . boeing has already been testing some of the changes . the plane maker believes it could rebuild the batteries by next month on the 50 jets that have been delivered to airlines . but federal officials are likely to move more slowly and demand more tests and assurances , and the final decision could rest with mr . huerta 's supervisors at the transportation###department . federal officials said that if the fixes check out , the jets could start flying again by april . boeing will also have to win back the confidence of the flying public . besides taking more steps to prevent short###circuits from occurring , boeing 's plan would enclose the battery within a sturdier metal container and create tubes to vent any hazardous###materials outside the plane . it would add systems to monitor the activity inside each cell instead of just the battery as a whole . industry officials said there is enough space in the electronics bay to expand the container and add the vent tubes . until now , regulators have focused on the need to pin down the cause of the battery problems . but investigators , now weeks into their work , have been able to find only limited clues in the charred remains of the batteries in the boston and japan incidents . the lithium###ion###batteries weigh less but provide more energy than conventional batteries , and the 787s make greater use of them than other planes . the stakes are substantial for boeing , which will have to pay penalties to some of the airlines that have been unable to use them . boeing also cannot deliver more of the planes while they are grounded . the company has orders for 800 additional planes . the jets rely as well on lightweight carbon composites and more efficient###engines . boeing awarded the contract for the batteries to gs yuasa , a japanese firm , in , and it won approval from the f.a.a . to use the batteries in . concerned about fires with smaller lithium###ion###batteries in cellphones and laptops , the agency placed special conditions on boeing 's use of the batteries that required containment and venting measures that have proved###inadequate . advances in research have contributed to a better understanding of the risks since then . but boeing , which was consumed with problems with other parts that delayed the introduction of the 787s by several years , did not significantly update the battery designs before it began###delivering the planes in . so boeing 's plan to fix the problems also amounts to a belated incorporation of what has been learned about how to handle the risks .
the russian state oil company , rosneft , intends to sign a major contract to supply china with more than 60 billion of crude###oil , a deal that could signal a small shift away from western###europe toward asia . russia has been gradually opening its oil spigot to china in recent###years . while the overall volume of russia 's oil output has remained level , the country has decreased sales to recession plagued europe . without any exaggeration a large###scale contract has been prepared by rosneft , said president vladimir v . putin said after a meeting on thursday with china 's vice premier , zhang###gaoli . supplies to china are expected to reach volumes of hundreds of millions of tons of oil , in total worth more than 60 billion mr . putin said , though he provided no further details about the hefty contract . even a modest shift could have a significant effect on europe , raising###prices across the region . russia is now the largest oil producer in the world , pumping about 10 million###barrels a day , slightly more than saudi###arabia . currently , russia exports about a fifth of its oil output to asia . it pipes oil directly to china after a trans siberian pipeline was completed in 2010 that overcame decades of tension along the long and remote border between siberia and manchuria . mr . putin told mr . zhang that he hopes two russian gas companies , gazprom and novatek , will similarly strike deals to export energy to china . energy analysts said rosneft has also been negotiating with chinese companies to form joint###ventures to drill in the russian sector of the arctic###ocean above eastern###siberia , after granting similar deals to exxon###mobil , eni of italy and the norwegian oil company statoil to drill in the kara###sea , an inlet on the western side of the long###coastline . the rosneft deal would become the latest in a series of financial###transactions between russian energy companies and china . rosneft first took a loan of 6 billion from chinese state banks as prepayment for oil###exports in . the company , in turn , used the money to finance its takeover of the largest production unit of yukos oil company , after the imprisonment of the founder , mikhail b . khodorkovsky , an episode criticized by western governments but not the chinese . in , chinese banks lent 25 billion to rosneft and the state oil###pipeline monopoly , transneft , to complete the trans siberian pipeline , called the east siberian pacific###ocean pipeline . under the terms of the deal , the banks would be repaid with . 5 billion###barrels###of###oil exported to china over 20 years from 2010 until . both sides have benefited . the volume of oil amounted to 4 percent of china 's oil demand over that period . on the russian side , the loan helped stabilize russia 's balance###of###payments###crisis in the recession that began in . the latest chinese deal will most likely allow the russian government to delay a planned privatization of 19 percent of rosneft 's shares , which faced political opposition . it also suggests closer financial###ties with china , which could help russia weather its current economic###slump .
london neymar da###silva , 21 , leaves his boyhood team , santos , to play alongside lionel###messi at barcelona . wilfried###zaha , not yet , helps his boyhood###club , crystal###palace , reach england 's premier###league , and he then leaves to play for manchester united . they live and were raised a world apart . but in what other walk of life would young###men be traded before they reach their potential for sums that might secure the survival of the clubs that discovered and nurtured them as children ? neymar , already the richest young athlete in brazil because of his endorsement###deals , sobbed when he played his final###game for santos on sunday . zaha , who was born in ivory###coast but moved to south###london when he was , played like a man inspired during his final appearance as a palace player on monday . his move to manchester united was sealed four months###ago , but united loaned him back to crystal###palace for the remainder of this season . there is as much of crystal###palace in young wilfried as there will always be santos inside neymar . these are the clubs that spotted their potential . they grew up there , were formed there , and it is not at all too strong to suggest that they were loved like family on the training###grounds of crystal###palace and santos . neymar was , perhaps , predestined to be a soccer###player . his gets his genes from his father , neymar sr . , a former player , and was inducted into pel 's old club , santos , back in , when he was just . i 've been here nearly all my life , the young superstar said sunday . every child has a dream to be a player , a dentist , maybe a reporter . mine was to be a professional athlete , and today barcelona is fulfilling my dream . i am going to a totally beautiful dream . which of us knows how that might turn out ? neymar 's skills are so totally transparent in brazil , but now he moves onto the stage of messi , xavi hern###ndez , andr###s###iniesta , and a whole school of world acclaimed players who grew up together at bar a . in terms of ability , neymar could be on their level . but he must adapt and he must know when , where and how to share the ball . and he must learn how to move without the ball , which is also intrinsic to the barcelona rhythm . in short , the brazilian who has set his own tempo and basked in his own acclaim without leaving his home###field now has to adapt his game . great###players , they say , can play anywhere neymar needs to , and not simply for his own sake . the world###cup takes###place in brazil one year from now , and either he returns a better player or as a confused one . zaha has already made one great adaptation . he arrived with his family to make a new life in a largely immigrant community south of london , and the tenacity that is required to make something of yourself in that environment has already been evident in the way he plays . another thing was evident , too the gratitude that the 20 year old zaha has shown these past two weeks to palace . he could have rested on his laurels , knowing that his deal was already done with manchester united and that next season , he would be on england 's biggest###stage . but no , zaha wanted his team , crystal###palace , to get promoted into the big###league before he left . the team entered the promotion playoffs weakened after an injury to its principal striker , glenn###murray . zaha came in off his wing to score twice against brighton as palace won the right to play monday at wembley for the final spot in the premier###league next season . zaha did not score sunday , but he was the class player on the field . he thrilled the , 000 fans , time and time again , with his galvanic runs , his physical###power and his insatiable desire to run watford down . watford , full of experienced internationals , put two or three players against him , but it still could not quell his running . for long spells , it seemed as if zaha might be a youth trying to do too much on his own . but then , well into overtime in an otherwise goalless stalemate , zaha 's running paid###dividends . he was simply too quick , too strong and too clever for marco###cassetti . the italian , on loan from udinese , was turning 36 this week the future manchester united star is 16 years his junior . cassetti lunged for the ball and caught the shin of zaha . up stepped an even older player , the almost 40 year old kevin###phillips , to hammer home the penalty###goal that won palace 120 million , or 180 million , with its place in the premiership . i 'm tired , every bit of me is aching , phillips said , but if that is my last kick in football , i 'll take it . he ushered zaha toward the microphones on the field . this man , he said , goes to manchester united now with our best wishes . and suddenly , zaha was in front of the cameras . i 'm speechless , he said . exhausted and speechless . it 's all i wanted . i told myself i 'm going to give 100 percent . all i wanted to do was help out the team , i 'm glad we actually made it . the reported fee that takes zaha from palace to united is 15 million , a fraction of the debts that almost sank the club three years###ago . but that 15 million is also but a tiny sliver of what zaha 's final run earned for the club as it tried to safeguard its future from here on out . the fee for neymar might never be truthfully told because neither santos nor barcelona intends to tell how , what , why or when the deal was struck . we could imagine it heavily involves nike , because the american sportswear giant wields great###influence in these issues . money is the business part . the talent is obvious . the human spirit will determine what becomes of neymar and zaha now . the bigwigs get all the good players , all the time , concluded crystal###palace 's manager , ian###holloway . we lose wilfred , but we 're in the premier###league . god help us .
washington american wholesalers increased their stockpiles in april , and their sales rebounded from a big decline in march , positive signs for economic###growth . the commerce###department said on tuesday that stockpiles at the wholesale level rose . 2 percent in april . that followed a.3 percent gain in march . sales in april increased . 5 percent , the best showing since february . in march , sales plunged . 4 percent . the april increase left stockpiles at the wholesale level at . 8 billion , up . 1 percent from a year ago and . 2 percent above the recession low . an increase in restocking can drive more economic###growth because it indicates companies are ordering more goods from american factories . the april gain was led by a.9 percent increase in restocking of autos and auto###parts . stockpiles of furniture , lumber and computer equipment also posted solid gains . inventories of machinery , farm products and chemicals were down in april . the economy grew at a.4 percent rate annual from january through march , up from a.4 percent rate in the previous quarter . growth accelerated in the first quarter largely because consumer###spending rose at the fastest pace in more than two years . that also provided more incentive for businesses to restock shelves after many cut back on inventory building at the end of last year . many economists suspect that growth has slowed in the current april june quarter , to an annual###rate of 2 percent or less . economists say part of that reflects a slowdown in production at american factories , stemming from weakness overseas that has dampened demand for exports . some economists also say businesses could be worried about the impact of federal spending###cuts . a stronger job###market has helped offset some of the weakness from the spending###cuts and higher payroll###taxes .

's dunk of the year . shumpert 's right arm extended almost perpendicular to the floor to cradle the ball , then swung forward with ferocious speed toward the rim . his legs curled backward . and when he finally###landed on the madison###square###garden floor , his surgically repaired left knee was fine . i 've stopped thinking about it , shumpert said after practice thursday as the knicks prepared for game 3 on saturday in indianapolis . the series is tied at one game each . it has been little more than a year since shumpert tore his anterior###cruciate###ligament in the third quarter of the knicks' playoff opener against the miami###heat last season . he returned jan . 17 , setting the standard for accelerated recovery in the n.b.a. , but for weeks he only vaguely resembled the staunch defender and explosive leaper the knicks saw last season , his rookie year . he was rusty and tentative , lacking confidence in his outside shot and his lateral quickness defending on the ball . he remained in coach mike###woodson 's starting###lineup , but his playing time dwindled to . 6 minutes per game in february . he wore a bulky knee brace and a look of bewilderment , trying to swim with the swift###current of the n.b.a . regular###season while worrying just how much wear his leg could withstand . i was constantly thinking about it , shumpert said . the scar along the side of the knee was not the issue as much as the conspicuous brace . once i took that off , i stopped , he said . in the postseason , with shumpert 's brace off , his playing time has risen and his production has flourished . he is shooting . 2 percent from 3 point range and averaging 10 points , 6.4 rebounds and . 5 steals###per###game . he is an unmistakable testament to patience , perseverance and the advances of medical science . and he is also , fairly or not , a constant reminder of the story in chicago surrounding bulls guard derrick###rose , who tore his a.c.l . only hours before shumpert injured his last april . with rose watching , the bulls and the heat are tied at a game each in their eastern conference###semifinal . derrick###rose is a franchise###player , shumpert said . it 's a totally different situation than what i am . while there is truth to that , shumpert has lately been an invaluable member of the knicks , providing a newfound scoring punch to go with his characteristic defense ability . woodson said he believed shumpert was playing his best basketball since the knicks drafted him in the first round in . his minutes have gone up , and a lot of that has to do with the fact that he 's gotten better , woodson said . his confidence###level is high . we just have to make sure we keep his confidence###level high and that he continues to play with that type of intensity to help us win games . shumpert said the confidence in his jump###shot , a source of frustration early in his return , stemmed from his teammates' willingness to keep letting him shoot . when you see a couple of them go in , you get more and more confident , shumpert said . my teammates are finding me when i 'm open they 're finding me when i have a slight###advantage . i guess the more confident they are in me , the more i play with . lately , with j . r . smith struggling and carmelo###anthony having difficulty###finding his rhythm , the knicks have needed shumpert 's offense . he has hit as many 3 pointers ( 12 ) during the postseason as he did during april . and he has lifted the team in other ways , as he did with the dunk he unleashed tuesday . nobody saw that coming , anthony said after game . it got the crowd going , got us going . our energy picked up after that . the throwdown might reverberate more loudly in chicago , signaling to bulls fans what they hope to someday have again with rose . fortunately for the knicks , they have it now . i 've been waiting my whole life to play in the playoffs , shumpert said . i 'm just living in the moment right now . amar'e stoudemire practiced thursday and played in a full court four on four scrimmage , and the knicks will most likely list him as questionable for game . mike###woodson said stoudemire could see between 10 and 15 minutes of action if he is able to play . ... point###guard raymond###felton missed practice for personal###reasons . woodson said it had nothing to do with his health .
( reuters ) ajax###amsterdam are going to court on wednesday to try and overturn a ban on their supporters attending their weekend clash against fellow dutch giants psv###eindhoven . ajax , together with two supporters groups , are taking the action against the city of eindhoven who , wary of possible supporter violence , had previously decided ajax fans could only travel to the philips stadium by special###trains . this is not possible at the weekend because of work on the railway , ajax said on their website###www . ajax . nl . dutch railways said they were unable to find a solution but eindhoven last weekend allowed a busload of ajax fans to watch their reserve###team play fc###eindhoven in the dutch second tier . the complaint will be heard in den###bosch on wednesday . sunday 's match is traditionally one of the highlights of the dutch season . between them ajax and psv have won 17 of the last 20 dutch###league titles .
( reuters ) a classy double from gary###hooper helped celtic beat hibernian 3 0 to lift the scottish###cup for the 36th time at hampden###park on sunday . hooper broke the deadlock after just eight minutes with his 30th goal of the season and he doubled his side 's advantage just after the half###hour with another smart finish from close###range . joe###ledley rounded off the scoring towards the end of the second half . the loss means hibs' wait for a first scottish###cup triumph since 1902 continues . it was their 11th final defeat . unlike last year 's 5 1 thrashing at the hands of edinburgh rivals hearts , however , they started with intent , with eoin###doyle forcing celtic keeper fraser###forster into a sharp save early on . they failed to capitalise on that bright opening , however , allowing hooper to volley the ball home at the far post after the hibs defence failed to clear and allowed anthony###stokes to provide a perfectly weighed cross . hooper repeated the dose after 31 minutes , evading two defenders to nod home another fine ball from stokes . hibs , missing injured captain james mcpake , came from 3 0 down at halftime to beat falkirk 4 3 in their semi###final but were unable to muster another great###comeback on this occasion . they had the odd bright spell in the second half but never seriously threatened forster 's goal and celtic added a third through ledley on 80 minutes . the win was celtic 's first domestic###double since , having easily###won the scottish###premier###league with a 16 point###margin , and rounds off a memorable season that saw them defeat barcelona in the champions###league###group###stage .
london the silver maserati arrived at the diagonal , the wide avenue in barcelona . watch now , said the driver , i 'll beat all the lights except the last . there were eight sets of traffic###lights in an 800 meter , or , 600 foot , stretch . the first seven were passed while they were still green . the year was . the man at the wheel was johan###cruyff . and the car symbolized the way he was and is lean , quicksilver fast and forever challenging the limitations around him . this wednesday###evening , barcelona plays ajax###amsterdam in the champions###league . it will be the first competitive meeting of the two clubs that cruyff helped to make great helped , indeed , to exhibit some of the most mellifluous styles in the global game . he was born in amsterdam and has lived in barcelona for more than half his 66 years , yet cruyff has vowed not to be in the camp###nou stadium on wednesday . i will support ajax , he said on rtl###television in the netherlands . i have had some differences with bar a 's president , and i will not set foot in the camp###nou as long as he is there . this , too , is symptomatic of johan###cruyff . there is his way of doing things , and any other way has to be wrong . the vast###majority of the 710 games he played and the 401 goals he scored were for ajax or barcelona or the netherlands###national###team . he even chose catalonia 's team as his second club because it represented the opposition to francisco###franco 's dictatorship in spain . but to cruyff , life was what he could control on the field . he was born close to the ajax stadium in the east of amsterdam , his mother was a cleaner at the club and he was drawn into the youth system there . even before rinus###michels , the stern trainer at ajax ( and later at barcelona ) became known as the father of total###football , cruyff was known for expressing all the skills of every position . he expressed them through movement , and very much through his outspoken opinions . when he spoke too much , the coaches would threaten to fine him or , worse , send him home . but they , even michels , were inspired by the beauty of cruyff 's belief that soccer need not be a sport of fixed positional###play or stereotypical patterns . when we watched lionel###messi thrive in the bar a team coached by pep###guardiola a couple of seasons ago , this was cruyff 's soccer . he was the coach who gave guardiola his debut as a player , and whose 1992 barcelona dream###team set the seed for the bar a of today . cruyff was its coach , the head###coach of the entire club from the academy up . guardiola was the captain of a side that featured jos###maria bakero , txiki###begiristain , gheorghe###hagi , michael###laudrup , rom###rio , hristo###stoichkov and the inevitable dutch connection , ronald###koeman . and where ajax with cruyff the player triumphed in the old european###cup , he later coached barcelona to the same title . even today the catalan dutch connection is maintained . frank de boer , the current ajax coach , played for barcelona from 1999 to . economics have determined that the modern ajax is no longer as flamboyant or as competitive as the one that cruyff led to european glory . it still has its youth system , but bar a 's is bigger , better and able to augment its graduates with world###class imports . neymar cost barcelona the better part of 100 million , about 134 million , once the transfer###payment to his brazilian club santos and his salary over the length of his contract are taken into account . cruyff 's transfer###fee when he left ajax for barcelona was also in the tens###of###millions but in pesetas , the former spanish currency , and worth about 2 million . it was another time , another valuation , and even the maserati was then around , 000 worth of extravagance . what has n't###changed , in cruyff 's eyes , is that soccer is just a game . driven by commerce , but it is still a game that in his case came from the street , and from his vision . neymar and messi might be aspiring cruyff like figures licensed to thrill . but one of cruyff 's differences with barcelona 's president , sandro###rosell , is that the dutchman does n't believe the team needed neymar . cruyff 's opinion , stated on tv and in newspaper columns , is that neymar and messi duplicate rather than complement each other . the signs of the past few weeks have suggested otherwise , although neymar has gone to great###lengths to forego his own scoring###opportunities while he tries to set up messi . that might be the brazilian 's way of showing he knows his place in the pecking###order in catalonia and that he is biding time before seeking a leading###role . ajax , alas , comes without any comparable star . it had a promising young playmaker , the dane christian###eriksen , but it sold him this month to tottenham###hotspur for about 18 million . that money is lifeblood to ajax , but since eriksen left , the team has lost its rhythm . if messi has seen images of the way we played at the weekend , said coach de boer , i doubt he 's too concerned . cruyff , who has fallen out with the board members running both his former clubs , has become the great outsider . he thinks rosell , the president of bar a , is too mercenary . and he is blames the coach for the way that ajax struggles . just because someone has a driving###license , cruyff said of de boer , does n't mean he is capable of driving a formula one car . straight to the point , like his straight###line driving 39 years###ago in barcelona .
it started in an unlikely place , far from the headquarters of more established technology companies , and grew to become a dominant player . along the way , investors piled in , undeterred by the company 's policy of never paying a dividend . but then the technology changed , and the company struggled to keep up . eventually it realized it could not continue as it was . it was broken up and acquired , with investors receiving a fraction of what their shares had been worth at the peak . that was the story of the digital###equipment###corporation , which was based in a former textile mill in maynard , mass . , and became the second largest computer company in the world in the 1980s . in , it was acquired by compaq , a maker of personal###computers that had destroyed digital 's business in mini computers . it proved to be a poor deal for compaq , which itself was acquired later by hewlett###packard . a year before digital was acquired , a small mobile technology company based in waterloo , ontario , went public on the canadian market . in , it listed on nasdaq and became a phenomenon . it was called research in motion until this year , when its corporate name was changed to that of its primary###product , blackberry . now it seems as if blackberry will follow the digital###equipment path . it has hired bankers to pursue its strategic options , and the expectation is that it will be acquired for its cash and patents while the product that made it rich and famous will gradually vanish . digital left behind a large###number of technology companies in massachusetts , some of which flourished in the very mill that digital made famous . blackberry 's impact on waterloo seems likely to be similar . this column is not about the changing technology that caused the decline of blackberry , which by now is well known . instead , it is about the way the company handled prosperity when profits were plentiful a way that served blackberry executives well and that pleased wall###street but provided no benefits to loyal shareholders . blackberry 's corporate filings show that over the years it distributed . 5 billion to shareholders . ( although blackberry is based in canada , it keeps its books in united###states###dollars and that number , like all others in this column , is in united###states currency . ) that is an impressive amount , especially considering that the entire company is now worth only a little more than 5 billion . but loyal shareholders did not receive any of that money . to get the money , an investor had to sell . the money was spent on share buybacks , and most of those buybacks came in 2008 and , when the company was flying high . blackberry 's financial strategy was not particularly unusual , although it does stand out in the way it abused the rules on executive stock###options . perhaps it would never have paid###dividends anyway , but those options gave the company 's executives good reasons to avoid dividends and concentrate on share buybacks . the result was a classic sell low and buy high strategy , one that did wonders for the executives . over the years , blackberry executives and employees exercised options to acquire . 3 million###shares , adjusted for two stock splits . on average , they paid . 38 a share . those prices were , of course , well below the market value of the shares at the time . that is the way options work or at least are supposed to work . the exercise###price is equal to the market###price when the options are issued , but the executive has up to 10 years to exercise them , and will do so only if the price has increased . one reason companies that issue a lot of options prefer stock buybacks to dividends is that while buybacks may raise the market value of the stock and thus increase the value of an outstanding option , dividends are less likely to do so . option holders , unlike shareholders , do not benefit from dividends . corporate managements like to say that options do not dilute shareholders' stakes because the company acquires and retires an offsetting number of shares . blackberry did just that , buying . 5 million###shares that it canceled . it bought an additional . 3 million###shares that it did not cancel but held to provide stock to issue directly to executives . over all , it paid an average of . 10 for the shares it repurchased .
a federal###appeals###court on tuesday struck down a national###labor###relations###board rule requiring most private###sector employers to post a notice informing employees of their right to unionize . ever since the labor board proposed the rule in december , business groups have asserted that the move exceeded the board 's authority and was an improper imposition on nearly six million employers , most of them small###businesses . in its decision , the united###states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit concluded that the n.l.r.b . 's rule violated a federal law that bars the board from punishing an employer for expressing its views so long as those statements do not constitute threats of retaliation or force . the labor board had originally said that an employer 's failure to post the notice would be considered an unfair###labor###practice , resulting in penalties , but the circuit###court said the board would be acting illegally to punish an employer for expressing a statement or in this case , for failing to post a statement under orders by the labor board . the labor board 's rule told employers to post a notice , informing workers of their right to form or join a union , to strike , to bargain###collectively and to act together to improve###working###conditions . the federal###circuit court issued an injunction in april , suspending the labor board 's rule , after two lower###courts differed on whether the board had overstepped its powers . the circuit###court cited several supreme###court###rulings to reach its decision that employers have a right to disseminate views as well as a right not to disseminate views . the court relied on first amendment rulings that prohibit the government from telling people what they must say , like telling schoolchildren they must recite the pledge of allegiance . many businesses asserted that the labor board 's proposed poster was one sided and pro###union , although the board said the poster was neutral . the national###association###of###manufacturers applauded the court 's ruling , calling it an important victory in the fight against an activist n.l.r.b . and its aggressive agenda . the poster rule is a prime example of a government###agency that seeks to fundamentally###change the way employers and employees communicate , the manufacturers' association said . the ultimate result of the n.l.r.b . 's intrusion would be to create hostile work environments where none exist . the a.f.l . c . i.o . attacked the ruling . the republican judges of the d.c . circuit continue to wreak###havoc on workers' rights , its president , richard l . trumka , said . the labor federation , like the obama administration , was already upset with the circuit###court for ruling in january that president###obama 's recess appointments to the labor board were illegal and that the board thus did not have a quorum needed to operate . the obama administration has appealed that decision to the supreme###court . mr . trumka questioned the sweep of tuesday 's ruling , saying in today 's workplace , employers are required to display posters explaining wage and hour rights , health and safety and discrimination laws , even emergency escape###routes . the circuit###court 's ruling suggests that courts should strike down hundreds of notice requirements , not only those that inform workers about their rights and warn them of hazards , but also those on cigarette packages , in home mortgages and many other areas . in holding that the labor board could not punish employers for failing to post the notice , the court decided to vacate the rule altogether , saying that the labor board would not have wanted to propose a merely voluntary rule that it could not enforce . in a statement , the labor board said it was reviewing tuesday 's ruling and would make a decision on further proceedings at the appropriate time . it noted that the fourth###circuit###court###of###appeals was also reviewing the legality of the poster rule .

enforcement of the law , one of the toughest in the nation , had been blocked by judicial###order in two prior elections , and the state had agreed not to require id to vote in november . but poll officials were required to tell voters that they would have to show id 's in the future or be turned away . in an opinion issued on friday###afternoon , judge bernard l . mcginley of the commonwealth###court###of###pennsylvania noted that the prior injunctions did not stop time , and said that the ban on enforcing the law should be extended until the matter of whether to issue a permanent###injunction on enforcement could be heard in court and decided on the merits of the case . jennifer r . clarke , executive###director of the public interest law center of philadelphia , which represents one of the plaintiffs , called the new ruling significant because it means we 'll have some peace and certainty until there 's a final###ruling . without the more lasting injunction , she said , it was very confusing and chaotic , i would say , for all sides last year regarding the law no one knew what would happen . a spokesman for pennsylvania 's attorney###general , kathleen###kane , who is defending the law in court , said , we will have no comment . pennsylvania voters have been told in two elections that they would not be able to return to the polls without id 's , which has proved inaccurate , judge mcginley noted . there is no value in inaccurate###information , he wrote . telling voters that they would not be able to vote without identification has been erroneous at best , deceptive at worst and will not be continued .
even a wild third period rally could not save the injury###ravaged rangers from losing their fourth###straight game tuesday###night at madison###square###garden . the rangers trailed the winnipeg###jets by scores of , 3 1 and 4 2 and finally###fell , 4 3 . they were plagued by errors from their regulars and the fill ins for rick###nash , ryan###mcdonagh , michael###del###zotto and arron###asham , all of whom did not play . everybody has injuries sometimes it kind of galvanizes you , coach john###tortorella said before the game . hopefully , it 'll make our structure stronger . it did not . the rangers started the evening in 10th place in the eastern###conference and fell to 11th , overtaken by the jets . ryan###callahan played an inspiring game , blocking shots , taking seven shots and going plus . his goal at 9 minutes 28 seconds of the second period snapped a team scoring###drought of 53 . in a second period sequence , he thwarted a winnipeg attack by blocking two shots and throwing a body check , all while playing without a stick , eliciting a standing###ovation . i was just trying to block shots , callahan said . it had nothing to do with trying to spark a team . it 's just the way we have to play , and that 's what you have to do to try and get wins . but callahan was the only ranger who played well . even henrik###lundqvist ( 28 saves ) had a problematic night , flubbing evander###kane 's shot halfway through the third period , 20 seconds after taylor###pyatt had brought the rangers within . less than a minute after kane 's goal , the rangers got it back when anton stralman made the score . but the rangers could not beat winnipeg goalie ondrej pavelec in the final desperate minutes . i 've gone over it a couple of times , and i 've tried to find out a reason why , lundqvist said . it does n't matter . i need to stop it . the loss marked the first time the rangers fell to the jets since the team moved to winnipeg last season from atlanta . the last time the rangers were beaten by a team called the winnipeg###jets was on nov . 17 , 1995 . the consequences of the rangers' injury depleted lineup were most visible on the goal that gave winnipeg a 3 1 lead at 48 of the second period . the rangers were trapped in their own zone and completely without structure for a long stretch . on the ice were defensemen matt###gilroy and stu bickel , and forwards jeff###halpern , chris###kreider and brandon mashinter . gilroy and bickel often do not dress for games , and kreider and mashinter have been back and forth between the rangers and their a.h.l . affiliate in connecticut . chris and mash , there is a bit of a struggle there a couple of times , but this is what happens when you have some injuries , tortorella said . you have the kids . you get really worried that you put them in a spot they are just not ready for yet . the rangers played a fourth###straight game without nash , who entered the game as their leading###scorer . he is out with an unspecified injury that is believed to be a concussion . nash practiced in the morning for the first time in nine days and dodged reporters' questions about whether he had a concussion . mcdonagh was hurt in saturday 's loss at montreal . the rangers listed him with a head###injury that is believed to be a concussion . del zotto was out for a second straight game with what the rangers termed a lower###body###injury . like nash , he practiced in the morning , but was scratched from the lineup . asham , the pugnacious fourth line wing , missed a third straight game . he told###reporters last week that he had back spasms . kane scored twice for winnipeg , as did the former ranger olli###jokinen . he is famous in rangers lore for being stopped on the last shootout attempt in the season###finale at philadelphia in , a miss that cost the rangers a playoff###berth and gave it to the flyers . in the rangers' current losing###streak , all four defeats have come against canadian teams . on thursday they hope to get a reprieve with a game against tampa###bay at the garden .
the question inevitably comes twice a year once in november , when the n.b.a . season usually starts , and again in the spring , when the playoffs near . my under the breath response yeah , i grew up a nets fan , lived on long###island , saw dr . j is usually enough of an answer . but every once in a while , a follow up question###arises but why are you still a nets fan ? my parents###owned chinese restaurants on long###island that used unusual architectural###details to stand out . one had a distinctive windmill . then they opened one with a golden dome , and there , at a place that my father modestly named after himself , my love###affair with the team truly began . danny chang 's was as aspirational as chinese restaurants could get at the time . egg foo young ? not on the menu . the dishes were spoon served by jacket clad captains , and drinks were brought by attractive###young###women . my father , who had worked at trader###vic 's , had learned a thing or two about showmanship . the restaurant was a hit . a fair number of well known people would come , but i was interested only in the sports stars the rangers , who came in their corvettes , and the jockey jorge velasquez , who , to my family , may have been the biggest celebrity to grace the dining###room . and then there was the night that would change my life as a basketball fan forever , the night i met the tallest###man i had ever seen . my dad handled the introductions mr . ladner , meet my son , dean . he 's a big fan . wendell ladner was a hard###nosed power###forward on the nets , a kurt###rambis type with a better mustache . fans###loved him . i now loved him , too . we shook###hands , mine disappearing into his . then he told me to wait for a moment while he stepped out to his car . he returned with an a.b.a . basketball , signed it and handed it to me . i had seen the nets play at nassau###coliseum they were still in the american###basketball###association then and i was as much of a dr . j fan as anyone else . but that was run of the mill , childhood hero worship . this was something different . ladner was my favorite###player , my direct###connection to a real###life pro no small thing when you 're . he began to visit the restaurant every once in a while one time , he brought along billy paultz , the nets center known as the whopper . another time , ladner gave me a second a.b.a . ball , this one signed by all the nets , dr . j included . danny chang 's was at the foot of the atlantic beach bridge , close enough to kennedy airport that your body shook when a big plane went by . the village , not yet saturated with million###dollar homes , had its share of airline workers who shared small beach homes in town . so , on the night of june , 1975 , the mood at the restaurant was understandably somber . earlier that day , eastern###air###lines flight 66 crashed near kennedy as it approached the runway wreckage was scattered along rockaway###boulevard . of the more than 100 passengers and crew , only a few survived . i do n't###recall how the news came to me whether my parents told me or i read it in the newspaper but there it was among the casualties was wendell ladner , his identity eventually confirmed , in part , because of the a.b.a . championship ring on his finger . i remember crying , primarily because ladner was dead and i would never see him again . and then i thought of the first basketball he had given me , which i boneheadedly had been using on the driveway court . his signature was all but erased by gravel and backboard . my kinship to the nets just became bulletproof . a year later , the a.b.a . and the n.b.a . merged , allowing the nets to join the big###league . if there was a high###point in my 30 years of being a nets fan , this might have been it a chance for the nets to prove their worth and justify my loyalty . but then the nets sold dr . j 's contract to the philadelphia 76ers for 3 million , in part to pay for the indemnity fee to join the league . and they moved to piscataway , n.j. , leaving long###island and most of their fans . better times would follow some good years in the 1980s and '90s , and back to back n.b.a . finals appearances with jason###kidd but i never really put complete faith in the team . it remained cursed for the dr . j deal , and my penance was still to be served for using , and eventually###losing , the ladner ball . penance can take unexpected forms , and for me , it took the form of duncan , the nets' dragonlike mascot for many years . ( history differs on whether duncan was a dragon or a swamp monster i would describe him differently . ) in early , in the midst of a dreadful season for the nets , i dragged a few college friends to the meadowlands to watch them play the detroit###pistons . with the game falling out of the nets' reach , duncan began###working the crowd , high fiving fans and interacting with youngsters . he was several rows lower than us when he spotted me . he opened his arms theatrically , and then clasped his hands together beneath his chin and bowed slowly and deeply , as an idiotic mascot might to an asian . then he did it again . and in case the gesture was lost on me , he walked up to my row and repeated it . come on . this was what a team mascot did to a fan ? i said a few choice words . duncan said nothing , continuing to genuflect until play resumed . i contemplated doing or saying more , but held back . it was as true then as it is now nothing good can come of a scrap with a team mascot . i have not been back to see the nets since , except for visits to the garden to see them play the knicks . but i 'm still a fan . i wish i could say that i still own the a.b.a . balls , but i do not . they were lost somewhere in my family 's trail of moves from new york to florida to mississippi not far , coincidentally , from where ladner grew up . i miss them , but i 've come to realize i do n't need to physically own them to retain the sentimental value of ladner 's gifts . the nets retired ladner 's no . 4 , but they have not hung his uniform in the rafters , where the other five retired###numbers are displayed . i hope that will change , and if it does , i will be there when it happens . i hear barclays###center is a nice place . and i hear they have a new mascot .
paris maria###sharapova survived a string of unforced###errors to book her place in the third round of the french###open on friday with a 6 2 6 4 rain delayed win against canada 's eugenie###bouchard . the defending###champion , seeded second at roland garros , returned to court philippe chatrier leading 6 2 4 2 after the match had been interrupted by rain late on thursday . despite bouchard 's late fight and a total of 28 unforced###errors from the russian , sharapova wrapped it up in 15 minutes on her first match###point . she will face china 's zheng###jie for a last 16 spot .
st . louis if tuesday###night was a raucous party , with pittsburgh hosting cincinnati in the pirates ' first playoff###game in 21 years , the st . louis###cardinals countered thursday with stately tradition . clydesdales clip clopped around the warning###track before the game , and busch###stadium was awash in its familiar sea of red . the cardinals then flexed their muscle on the field , battering the pirates , 9 1 , to take the first game of their best of five national###league###division###series . st . louis , making its 10th appearance in the playoffs in the last 14 seasons , knocked out 10 hits and scored an n.l.d.s . record seven third inning runs . the cardinals were led by two postseason veterans , a commodity in short supply in the pirates' dugout , with carlos beltran hitting a three run homer to open the scoring and a nearly unhittable adam###wainwright pitching seven innings of one run ball . we never undervalue experience , cardinals manager mike###matheny said . it comes back to a pretty simple approach they 're going to do what they know is best and what they 've been doing all season long . the underdog pirates had captured the imagination of baseball fans across the country by ending their long playoff###drought and reaching the division###series with a 6 2 win over the reds on tuesday###night . but in game 1 here , they committed three errors , mustered only four hits and generally###looked more like the bumbling pittsburgh teams of the last two decades than the squad that won 94 games during the regular###season . a nightmarish third inning doomed the pirates' chances thursday . a . j . burnett , the pirates' starter , walked wainwright to start the inning , and matt carpenter followed with a single . that brought up beltran , who entered the game with a . 250 on base plus slugging###percentage in the playoffs , the best mark in baseball history . he turned on a fastball and blasted it into the second deck in right field . the home###run , the 15th of beltran 's career in the postseason , seemed to shock the pirates out of their october glee like a cold , hard slap . after matt###holliday doubled to right center###field , burnett completed his self destruction . he hit matt###adams and walked yadier###molina and jon###jay to force in a run . he then allowed a two run single to david###freese , and an errant throw from right fielder marlon###byrd allowed jay to score as well . with that , burnett was done for the game . two weeks###ago , hurdle mapped out his starting###rotation to ensure that burnett would start game 1 of the division###series . on a team on which only six players had postseason experience , burnett had two world###series rings and seven playoff starts , even if his postseason earned###run###average exceeded . 00 . that 's how important it was to us , hurdle said . we planned it out a while ago . burnett , though , did not make it out of the third inning , allowing six hits , four walks and seven earned###runs in his worst playoff outing since game 5 of the 2009 world###series , when he played for the yankees . my sinker was cutting , and i had no hook , burnett said . i was anxious . wainwright pitched like a cool veteran . his devastating curveball the same pitch that froze beltran , then a met , to end game 7 of the 2006 national###league###championship###series left pirates hitters either flailing or buckling . wainwright did not allow a base###runner until the fourth###inning and struck out nine , his only blemish being a solo home###run by pedro alvarez . he had a lot of swing and misses on his curveball , the pirates' andrew###mccutchen said . if we were to let go of that pitch , it might have been a different ballgame . the cardinals and the pirates , n.l . central division rivals , were evenly###matched during the regular###season . the pirates won 10 of their 19 meetings but lost six of nine at busch###stadium . what appeared to separate the teams most was recent###history . while the pirates are strangers to meaningful autumn games , the cardinals have won 11 world###series including the 2006 and 2011 titles and make regular###appearances on baseball 's biggest###stage . hurdle had talked at length about the legacy of winning and the atmosphere his team would find in st . louis . it drips with tradition , with respect , with integrity , with professionalism , he said . those qualities were on display again thursday . freese made a diving catch in the third inning to rob clint###barmes of an extra###base###hit . later in the game , cardinals reliever carlos martinez made a terrific play by throwing out russell###martin on a roller up the third base###line . meanwhile , a barmes throwing###error helped the cardinals score their eighth run , and mccutchen overran a ground###ball in center###field that led to st . louis 's ninth run . before the game , matheny was asked about the momentum the pirates seemed to be riding . we do n't spend a lot of time thinking about them , he said . after a game 1 blowout , the pirates will have plenty to think about themselves .
new york third seeded agnieszka radwanska cruised into the second round of the u.s . open with a , 6 2 win over silvia soler espinosa on monday . in the tournament 's first match at arthur###ashe###stadium , radwanska needed only 63 minutes to improve to 28 2 in grand###slam openers . she won 15 of 21 points at the net . the u.s . open is the only major tournament in which the polish star has never made the quarterfinals . she has reached that stage at the first three grand###slam events this year , something no other woman has accomplished . the 69th ranked soler espinosa , from spain , advanced to the third round at the u.s . open the last two years .
chicago next march will mark the 35th anniversary of the 1979 n.c.a.a . title game between larry###bird 's indiana###state###sycamores and magic###johnson 's michigan###state###spartans . the game remains one of the few instances when the undisputed top two players in college###basketball competed against each other , and it is the highest###rated televised college###basketball game ever . on tuesday###night , basketball fans caught a glimpse of perhaps the next great individual basketball###rivalry that could extend not only into the n.b.a. , but in the annals of history alongside bird and magic , when two superstar freshmen , duke 's jabari###parker and kansas 's andrew###wiggins , faced each other in the state###farm champions classic . wiggins 's fifth ranked jayhawks defeated the fourth###ranked blue###devils , 94 83 , but both players showed the skill that has their fan###bases thinking they could make runs deep into the spring . parker outscored wiggins by 27 points to , including converting on a spectacular one handed alley###oop early in the second half that even brought the crowd 's large contingent of anti duke fans to their feet . but wiggins scored key baskets down the stretch as kansas pulled away in the final two minutes . duke and kansas , two teams steeped in tradition and built on coaching mastery and seasoned , versatile lineups , are again expected to contend for this year 's championship . but both programs are in the unfamiliar position of being led by 18 year olds , who are also perhaps among the most hyped freshmen ever . and neither team is assured of having its star freshman for more than a year . even johnson seemed excited about their potential effect this season and beyond . the hype definitely goes along with their game because they both can play , johnson said . we have n't seen this type of class come out in a long time with this many guys . normally , you might have a lebron , you might have one . with kansas up , 83 81 , with 1 minute 33 seconds remaining , wiggins hit a fadeaway jump shot to increase the lead to . then , 11 seconds later , after a steal by perry###ellis , wiggins converted a two handed dunk off the fast###break . wiggins , who was fouled on the play , missed his free###throw , but he grabbed the offensive###rebound to wind the clock down further . the hype , it was big , wiggins said . i just tried to block it out . in lawrence , wiggins was compared to wilt###chamberlain before he ever played a game at allen###fieldhouse . not to be outdone , parker arrived in durham , n.c. , having been proclaimed on the cover of sports###illustrated as the best high###school basketball###player since lebron###james , after his junior###season . both players are the sons of former n.b.a . players . sonny parker logged six seasons in the league for the golden###state###warriors , averaging . 9 points a game , and mitchell wiggins , who also played parts of six seasons for chicago , houston and philadelphia , averaged 10 points . the razor thin difference between their father 's career scoring averages has so far also applied to the separation of their talent levels by outside evaluators . jabari###parker 's skills proved themselves at an earlier age as he was ranked as a top 10 prospect in his age###group while in fifth grade . three years later , his high###school selection announcement made headlines . he was named the gatorade national player of the year as a junior , joining greg###oden , brandon knight and james as the only players to do so . even chicago 's mayor , rahm###emanuel , referred to parker as a role###model . but last year , the canadian###born wiggins surpassed parker in rankings as the consensus top prep player in the nation and effectively usurped parker 's title as the next lebron###james . the first round of their nascent rivalry gave parker the opportunity to prove himself in front of a hometown###crowd . a star at chicago 's simeon###career###academy , parker was a four time state champion and the first freshman to start for the varsity , a feat not even accomplished by chicago###bulls guard derrick###rose or the 1980s prep###star ben###wilson , who was shot and killed during his senior year of high###school . not even the rare no . 1 versus . no . 2 regular###season matchup could overshadow the anticipation for the parker wiggins showdown as duke and kansas headlined a doubleheader . in the opening game , the top ranked kentucky###wildcats , a team also anchored by freshmen including six 2013 mcdonald 's all americans fell to michigan###state , 78 74 . kentucky 's julius###randle made his own claim for the title of nation 's top freshman , scoring 23 points in the second half en###route to a total of 27 points . the wildcats continually looked for him inside as they erased a 44 32 halftime###deficit to tie the game at 66 66 with 4 minutes 48 seconds remaining in the second half . but for every kentucky run , michigan###state answered with fast###break points , usually by way of a layup by keith appling ( 22 points ) or gary###harris . we put a bigger emphasis on it this summer , harris said . this is what we worked for , to run in games like this . michigan###state coach tom###izzo said he was impressed by the play of randle , who also had 13 rebounds . what i loved about him , he gritted his teeth , was ornery and nasty and wanted to put them on his shoulders , izzo said . for a freshman , that speaks###volumes . you could hear him talking , you could see it in his face , you could see it in his body###language . tough kid , love him . johnson , despite rooting for the spartans , also seemed impressed by randle . shaking his head , he pondered the possibility of seeing randle , wiggins and parker at the next level . i think if they all come out to the n.b.a. , it 's going to be awesome , johnson said .
rio###de###janeiro###brazil hope to face eastern###european and central###american opposition before next year 's world###cup in a bid to familiarise themselves with styles similar to those of group rivals croatia and mexico , officials said on wednesday . the brazilian###football###confederation is in talks with serbia and the czech###republic for a friendly on june 4 and it is also expected to sound out central###american sides for a game on june , according to carlos###alberto###parreira , brazil 's assistant###coach . serbia is one of the candidates , they 're a strong side , and technically very proficient , parreira said , before adding that they hoped to find a central###american side that would not provide too much trouble and do n't have a physical style that will upset us . brazil recently played honduras and were angered at some of the tough###tackling , particularly on barcelona striker neymar . brazil won the match . brazil open their world###cup campaign in sao###paulo against croatia on june 12 and then play mexico in fortaleza on june . their final group a match is against cameroon in brasilia on june . manager luiz###felipe###scolari is to announce their squad on may , and 19 days later the players will gather at the team 's headquarters outside rio de janeiro . so far brazil has only one friendly arranged before then , against south###africa in johannesburg on march . brazil will host the world###cup next year for the first time since .
ardmore , pennsylvania webb###simpson has an appreciation of golf history and the reigning u.s . open###champion hopes to take advantage of his crack at making some of his own at historic merion###golf###club this week . simpson , who prevailed at brutally difficult olympic last year by one stroke for his maiden major , could become the first repeat u.s . open winner in 24 years . curtis###strange achieved the feat in , proclaiming move over , ben after following in the footsteps of ben###hogan , who had been the previous man to win back to back opens in . it does n't surprise me , american simpson said on tuesday about how rare it has been to reproduce u.s . open magic from one year to the next . the biggest###factor is the courses change every year . they 're at a different venue . merion is a totally different type golf course than olympic . olympic will always be treasured by simpson , but the 27 year old north carolinian has had a love###affair with merion since his first visit nine years###ago and calls it his favorite course . merion was where bobby###jones completed his grand###slam with a 1930 victory in the u.s . amateur , and 20 years later more lore was made when hogan rifled a one iron to the 18th green on the 72nd hole to force a playoff that gave him an inspirational major victory 16 months after a near fatal###car###crash . the first time i came here was , before the u.s . amateur . i came with my dad and a couple of guys . it was november , the weather was bad , said simpson . we sat in the clubhouse with one of the long time members . he was telling us the history of the club , hogan 's shot on , the story behind that , a story within the story . simpson came back the next year for the amateur competition . when i played in '05 i instantly fell in love with this golf course . i grew up on a short golf course and i felt like too many courses nowadays come with a standard , 7 , 600 yards , and merion is so different . we all know it 's short , but it 's still as hard as other courses , added simpson , who lost to anthony###kim in the second round of the 2005 u.s . amateur . at its bestlike most of the players , simpson wishes rain drenched merion could be at its best , with its fast running , tilted fairways sending tee shots into the penal rough and the sloping greens a challenge to proper placement of approach shots . still , simpson expects the grand old course to provide a worthy stage for the year 's second major championship . merion is going to be fun for the viewers , the players and the fans ... because if you go out and you play well , you shoot a good number , simpson said . you go out and you do n't###play well you can shoot a really high number . simpson has not won since his u.s . open triumph but has been in reasonably good form on the pga###tour this season with three top 10s in 14 starts , including a playoff###loss to graeme###mcdowell at the rbc###heritage in april . merion 's iconic east course will be hosting its fifth u.s . open this week , but its first in 32 years after long being regarded as too short to host a major . simpson is thrilled for the opportunity . there has n't been a day that went by that i have n't thought about winning the u.s . open , being the u.s . open###champion , and being announced on the first tee as u.s . open###champion has n't gotten old , simpson said . i do n't want that to change . i 'm looking forward to it this week in so many ways , looking forward to trying to defend the title .
the saxophone is the most ambiguous of instruments . though ubiquitous in jazz and pop , it has long remained on the fringes of classical###music , brought in for the occasional bolero , but rarely afforded the spotlight . when it finds its way into the orchestra , it often functions as a jazzy outsider , an ambassador of pop . few contemporary###composers are better poised to trade on the saxophone 's ambivalent status than john###adams , who long###ago mastered the art of moving nimbly between the classical and pop worlds . mr . adams has toyed with the instrument ever since he introduced a saxophone###quartet into his opera nixon in china a quarter century ago . and in recent###years , mr . adams has rediscovered the saxophone and its midcentury jazz legacy , even as he has distanced himself from young###composers who draw on the commercial###music of their own era . when the soloist timothy mcallister and the baltimore###symphony###orchestra give the united###states premiere of mr . adams 's saxophone concerto on friday at meyerhoff symphony hall in baltimore , it will be an auspicious event for the large but often overlooked world of classical saxophonists . those who miss the baltimore performances can hear the concerto performed by mr . mcallister and the st . louis###symphony###orchestra in a live online broadcast on oct . 5 nonesuch will release a recording next spring . this new work grew out of mr . adams 's lifelong###love for the slippery sound of the sax , and also took inspiration from the virtuoso technique of mr . mcallister , who is a professor at the bienen school of music at northwestern , and , at , one of the foremost saxophonists of his generation . in , mr . adams heard mr . mcallister play city noir , mr . adams 's jazz inflected symphonic work with a major saxophone part , and decided he had to write more for him . in a recent phone###interview , mr . adams eagerly extolled mr . mcallister 's strengths . you find that with great###artists that the details , the actual technical###details of the instrument the reed , the mouthpiece , the pads and all of those little , tiny , minuscule physical details are so important , mr . adams said . on the one hand , that impressed me , and the other was just his absolute , indefatigable willingness to just do anything . mr . mcallister seized the opportunity . for me , personally , adams has been no . 1 he 's been , for me , the no . 1 goal of someone we need to get a piece from , he said recently . it 's still adams at the core deep polyrhythmic structures , these huge , giant , kind of glacial forms . that 's really exciting , to hear these trademarks about his music and then referencing the saxophone in these multiple settings . the saxophone has autobiographical implications for mr . adams , who says that it has always been a part of my musical genealogy . his father played alto in swing###bands in the 1930s , and mr . adams dabbled with the sax in his youth . ( his main###instrument was clarinet . ) though the saxophone has its own classical repertory , mr . adams sought out models from jazz . stan###getz 's 1961 album , focus , and the compilation charlie###parker with strings were particular inspirations . the sound of the saxophone with the orchestra , particularly with the string###orchestra , is just magical , mr . adams said . it always puzzled me that there were so few saxophone concertos , and certainly no really great saxophone concerto in the way that there 's the mozart clarinet concerto . there are , in fact , more than a few saxophone concertos just none that are regularly###performed by symphony###orchestras . ( the best known are by relatively obscure composers like glazunov and ibert . ) invented by adolphe###sax in 1846 for military###bands , the saxophone had a few early classical advocates , like berlioz . but snobbery and intonation issues mostly kept the instrument out of the orchestra . instead , saxophones found their way into american dance bands in the 1910s , and became core members of swing###bands , as well as the instruments of choice for jazz soloists .
in its opening game this season , the liberty men 's basketball###team had two starters sidelined with injuries and lost by 42 points . then things got really bleak . the team 's best returning player was ruled out for the season with a stress###fracture in his foot . two others in the playing rotation quit the team . and liberty , the christian institution founded by jerry###falwell in lynchburg , va . , lost its next seven games . it was doom and gloom , said liberty coach dale layer , describing the team 's mood with an 0 8 record . but i told the players that if we held out hope and kept it together day by day , we still had a chance . i said , 'trust me , in this sport , if you play well at the end of the year , that 's all that matters . ' keeping the faith is a way of life at liberty , and while the team continued on an uneven path through the regular###season , when the big###south###conference postseason###tournament rolled around , it was ready to test layer 's maxim . with four consecutive upsets , each one a little more astounding than the last , liberty won the big###south tournament and barged into the n.c.a.a . tournament with a 15 20 record . liberty was in the big###dance , a cinderella before the ball . as adults , you tell your kids that they can defy logic and beat all the odds , layer said . but it is life changing for them when they see it happen . and they 'll###never###forget it . the flames became the second team with 20 or more losses to qualify for college###basketball 's marquee event , joining coppin###state 's team from . earning an automatic###berth into the national obsession that is march###madness is another step in the institutional mission of athletics at liberty , where the hope is that the teams will help spread the word of evangelical###christianity throughout the united###states . liberty has a motto for its cause champions for christ . and while few people filling out n.c.a.a . tournament brackets next week will have liberty advancing to the championship game , millions will , for a few seconds at least , ponder the flames' fate and pause to wonder who they are . maybe everyone in new york will learn about us now , said guard davon marshall , who is from niagara###falls , n.y. , and who until a year ago attended monroe###college , founded in the bronx 80 years###ago . i 've###spent too much time in the last year explaining where liberty is . the university is in the midst of an athletic spending###spree on facilities , scholarships and coaches that has elevated the competitive###level of many sports the women 's basketball###team , for example , has made the n.c.a.a . tournament in 16 of the last 17 years . administrators , including chancellor jerry###falwell jr . , a son of the founder , are lobbying to join a bowl###championship###series conference so the football###team can one day vault into the big time . the idea is for liberty to do in the 21 st century for evangelical christians what notre###dame football did for roman###catholics in the 20th . there 's going to be a lot of tvs tuned to the n.c.a.a . tournament next week , athletic###director jeff barber said . they 're going to see liberty , and they 'll hear a little of our story and hopefully learn what makes us unique . the liberty roster is already an unusual mix of players from all over the united###states , as well as poland , venezuela and nigeria . it features players who turned down scholarship offers from major basketball programs like oregon , oklahoma , providence and nevada###las###vegas , at least in part because of the christian education at liberty . marshall , named the big###south tournament 's most valuable###player after making 17 of 24 3 point###shots during liberty 's four postseason###games , turned down several other division i institutions when he left monroe last year . i grew up in church a lot , and i wanted to be around people with a similar background , said marshall , who had no scholarship offers out of high###school and walked on at monroe . i wanted to keep my christian foundation . his backcourt mate , john caleb sanders , was ranked among the top high###school recruits from the houston###area but spurned several established programs and committed to liberty in his sophomore year of high###school . home###schooled by his parents his mother did the tutoring and his father the coaching sanders played in the homeschool christian youth###association , as did his older###brother , jesse , who played for liberty until last year and left as the team 's career###assists leader .
detroit the city###council is both anxious and defiant . public employees' unions are bracing for a showdown . protests and lawsuits are promised . meanwhile , the mayor has simply stopped###talking about what is on nearly everyone 's mind in this troubled city . all across detroit , tension is building as a state appointed emergency manager prepares to take control of the city government on monday and begin a drastic restructuring of its finances and operations . there is anxiety . there is fear of the unknown , said yolanda langston , the president of a service###employees###international###union 's local in detroit . we do n't know which way he 's going to go . since gov . rick snyderannounced the state takeover on march , there has been a dearth of information about the first steps in the long###awaited turnaround of detroit . but that will change at 01 a.m . monday , when kevyn d . orr , a 54 year old bankruptcy lawyer from washington , is given the authority to fix the city however he sees###fit . mr . orr has spent the past week entrenched in a state###office###building in downtown###detroit , poring over briefing books and privately meeting with outside consultants and behind the scenes supporters in the city . he has so far held back from talking with elected###officials , union leaders and creditors even as speculation grows about how he will tackle the cash shortfalls and huge long###term liabilities that have crippled many city services for detroit 's , 000 residents . yet he knows that once he is on the job , he will have to generate cooperation for some painful measures or force them on people who already resent his appointment . i 'm used to meeting###resistance , mr . orr said in an interview , alluding to his legal career in bankruptcy court . what i 'm hoping is that once we get into it and get rid of some of the initial angst and concern , we 'll move to the rule of reason . the republican governor 's decision to install an emergency manager for the democratic controlled city had been widely###expected for months . still , the reality of a state takeover of its largest###city has left many here shocked and visibly nervous about the future . at the city###council 's last meeting before the takeover , some residents vented their anger , while council members wondered aloud if they would have any statutory###powers at all once mr . orr took office . i am angry , like so many thousands of other residents of detroit , said kathy montgomery , 64 . angry that our governor and mayor decided we need an emergency manager . we must oppose them . the emergency manager law gives mr . orr extraordinary###powers to reshape the city , including eliminating council members' salaries . i do n't know what kind of role we can have , said brenda jones , one of nine city###council members . i feel that we are just sitting here as a symbolic symbol right now . mayordave bing , who chose at the final hour not to oppose mr . orr 's appointment , will not publicly discuss what happens next . at a news conference on friday on new police initiatives , he declined to answer###questions about mr . orr . resistance , however , is building among some more vocal###opponents , like the city 's council of baptist pastors , which has called for a lawsuit to block mr . orr 's appointment . the president of the detroit chapter of the n.a.a.c.p. , the rev . wendell anthony , said he expected to see protests in the coming###week . it 's not about how we should brace for mr . orr , he said . mr . orr should brace for detroit . reaction to mr . orr 's arrival has been more favorable among business###leaders and other community groups . and even as some union leaders worry about job###cuts , others hope for a dialogue that minimizes reductions . mr . orr , for his part , said he was eager to begin fruitful negotiations , while at the same time reserving the possibility of a bankruptcy###filing that would void city contracts . you never want to enter a situation by taking anything off the table , he said . you have to be honest . he can expect the same candor in return from the chiefs of the police and fire unions , groups that have absorbed repeated personnel and budget###cuts despite increases in homicides and arsons .
london former tottenham###hotspur midfielder tim###sherwood was bursting with pride on tuesday following his appointment as manager of the london club until the end of next season . sherwood was given the job on a permanent###basis on monday after taking over last week in a caretaker capacity from portuguese andre villas###boas who was sacked after an embarrassing 5 0 home drubbing by liverpool . it 's an honour to be head###coach of this top club , the former england international told the spurs website ( www . tottenhamhotspur . com . i 've known it from the grass###roots right up to the first team , worked at every level of the football###club and played here , so i know it better than most . hopefully that will stand me in good stead taking this club forward . spurs , who are seventh in the premier###league , decided on monday to promote the inexperienced sherwood from his role as youth###development manager . a highly###rated coach , the 44 year old won the league as captain of blackburn rovers in 1995 before joining spurs four years later . sherwood stayed at white###hart###lane until , making almost 100 appearances for the club , before returning five years later to join the coaching###staff . his first game as caretaker###coach was a 2 1 capital one cup###quarter###final defeat by west###ham united last week but spurs bounced back by winning 3 2 in the league at southampton on sunday . if you cut me in half i bleed the colour of the club , said sherwood on tuesday . spurs , who are six points behind league###leaders liverpool , entertain west###bromwich###albion on thursday .
washington the supreme###court on tuesday effectively struck down the heart of the voting###rights###act of 1965 by a 5 to 4 vote , freeing nine states , mostly in the south , to change their election laws without advance federal###approval . the court divided along ideological###lines , and the two sides drew sharply different lessons from the history of the civil###rights movement and the nation 's progress in rooting out racial###discrimination in voting . at the core of the disagreement was whether racial###minorities continued to face barriers to voting in states with a history of discrimination . our country has changed , chief###justice john g . roberts jr . wrote for the majority . while any racial###discrimination in voting is too much , congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions . the decision will have immediate practical consequences . texas announced shortly after the decision that a voter###identification law that had been blocked would go into effect immediately , and that redistricting maps there would no longer need federal###approval . changes in voting###procedures in the places that had been covered by the law , including ones concerning restrictions on early###voting , will now be subject only to after the fact litigation . president###obama , whose election as the nation 's first black president was cited by critics of the law as evidence that it was no longer needed , said he was deeply###disappointed by the ruling . justice ruth###bader###ginsburg summarized her dissent from the bench , an unusual move and a sign of deep disagreement . she cited the words of the rev . dr . martin###luther###king###jr . and said his legacy and the nation 's commitment to justice had been disserved by today 's decision . she said the focus of the voting###rights###act had properly changed from first generation barriers to ballot###access to second generation barriers like racial gerrymandering and laws requiring at###large voting in places with a sizable black minority . she said the law had been effective in thwarting such efforts . the law had applied to nine states alabama , alaska , arizona , georgia , louisiana , mississippi , south###carolina , texas and virginia and to scores of counties and municipalities in other states , including brooklyn , manhattan and the bronx . chief###justice roberts wrote that congress remained free to try to impose federal###oversight on states where voting rights were at risk , but must do so based on contemporary data . but the chances that the current congress could reach agreement on where federal###oversight is required are small , most analysts say . justices antonin###scalia , anthony m . kennedy , clarence###thomas and samuel a . alito jr . joined the majority###opinion . justice###ginsburg was joined in dissent by justices stephen g . breyer , sonia###sotomayor and elena###kagan . the majority held that the coverage formula in section 4 of the voting###rights###act , originally passed in 1965 and most recently###updated by congress in , was unconstitutional . the section determined which states must receive clearance from the justice###department or a federal court in washington before they made minor changes to voting###procedures , like moving a polling###place , or major ones , like redrawing electoral###districts . section , which sets out the preclearance requirement , was originally###scheduled to expire in five years . congress repeatedly extended it for five years in , seven years in , and 25 years in . congress renewed the act in 2006 after holding extensive hearings on the persistence of racial###discrimination at the polls , again extending the preclearance requirement for 25 years . but it relied on data from the 1975 reauthorization to decide which states and localities were covered . the current coverage system , chief###justice roberts wrote , is based on 40 year old facts having no logical relationship to the present day . congress if it is to divide the states must identify those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes###sense in light of current conditions , he wrote . it cannot simply rely on the past . the decision did not strike down section , but without section , the later section is without significance unless congress passes a new bill for determining which states would be covered . it was hardly clear , at any rate , that the court 's conservative majority would uphold section 5 if the question returned to the court in the unlikely event that congress enacted a new coverage formula . in a concurrence , justice thomas called for striking down section 5 immediately , saying that the majority###opinion had provided the reasons and had merely left the inevitable conclusion unstated .
wimbledon , england andy###murray still looked the same monday###morning after a wimbledon title and 90 minutes of sleep . he still sounded the same , too , with his droll drone of a voice , which , come to think of it , always sounds a bit groggy . but the questions were different , delightfully different , if you were murray . what about a knighthood ? will it be hard to stay###hungry after achieving your three obvious goals ? can you talk about what this wimbledon victory means to the british people ? that last question must have sounded particularly novel , given that murray , like every top male british tennis###player from buster###mottram to tim###henman , had spent his career trying to live up to fred###perry , who won the last of his three wimbledon singles titles in . to finally have done it , it will be nice as a nation that we do n't have to look at wimbledon as a negative , murray said . it can be viewed as a positive . i just hope it 's not another 70 odd###years again . murray said so after posing with the men 's trophy in front of perry 's statue in the monday sunshine . it is worth underscoring that virginia###wade did win the women 's singles title here in . wade was at wimbledon as a bbc###commentator , and it was poignant to watch her enter the gates of the all england club one day last week . she walked through on her own in her flat soled shoes and sunglasses , her hair gone gray . no one accosted her . no one shouted her name , aimed a smartphone in her direction or extended so much as a program to autograph as she made her way toward centre court . it may take another 36 years for murray to have the same sort of treatment and peace at wimbledon . the attempt to match perry had grown through the decades into a quest and also a reliable hook on which to hang the british narrative every july . murray 's straight###sets###victory over novak###djokovic in sunday 's final will stir up all sorts of other possibilities . in the rankings released monday , djokovic is still no . 1 . murray is still no . 2 , followed by david###ferrer , rafael###nadal and roger###federer , who lost in the second round and fell outside the top four for the first time since june . murray , the holder of the united###states open and wimbledon titles , now has a platform from which to try to become the first british player to reach no . 1 since the tour rankings began in . it 's a tough one for me because right now i won two slams , was in the final of a third one and hold olympic gold , and i 'm nowhere near being no . 1 , murray said . i do n't know exactly why that is . i may need to be more consistent in the other events , and obviously missing the french###open did n't help that . but i 'd rather not get to no . 1 and win more grand###slams than win no more grand###slams and get to no . 1 . that is a common sentiment in this slam centric era , with much focus and energy on the four major events . but murray clearly made the right choice to skip the french###open and address his ailing back in time to make a full bore run at wimbledon . asked before the final what might change if murray did finally win , peter###mcnamara , a former australian star turned coach , smiled and said , you will call him sir . a knighthood does seem likely , given that bradley###wiggins received one last year after winning an olympic gold and the tour de france . i think it 's a nice thing to have or be offered , murray said . i think just because everyone is waiting for such a long time for this , that 's probably what will be suggested . but i do n't know if it merits that . david###cameron , the british###prime###minister , who was in the royal box on sunday at wimbledon , told###reporters that he certainly thought it did . and the bbc reported monday that queen###elizabeth###ii had sent murray a private message . more news on the knighthood is surely to come , but murray 's achievement has a twist in that he is scottish , not english . it 's a great###thing it 's a great###thing for scotland , too , because scotland feels like they 've taken something away from the english , said pat###cash , the 1987 wimbledon champion from australia who has long lived in britain . they feel like they 've owned something from the english now that the english could n't get . one of the royal box sideshows sunday was scotland 's first minister , alex###salmond , waving the saltire , the white and blue scottish flag , in the row directly behind cameron after the victory . no scotsman had won the singles at wimbledon since harold###mahony in . salmond was later asked on bbc###radio whether murray 's achievement had been a triumph for britain .
washington forget elephants . dolphins can swim circles around them when it comes to long###term###memory . scientists in a new study repeatedly found that dolphins can remember the distinctive whistle which acts as a name to the marine###mammal of another dolphin they have n't seen in two decades . bailey the dolphin had n't seen another dolphin named allie since the two juveniles lived together at the dolphin connection in the florida###keys . allie ended up in a chicago###area zoo , while bailey got moved to bermuda . yet 20 1 2 years later , bailey recognized and reacted to allie 's distinctive signal when university of chicago researcher jason bruck played it on a speaker . other dolphins had similar steel trap memories . and it 's not just for relatives . it 's non kin too . it 's mind###blowing i know i ca n't do it , bruck says . dolphins in fact have the longest social memory in all of the animal###kingdom because their signature whistle does n't###change . studies have shown that monkeys can remember things for about four years and anecdotes have elephants remembering for about , bruck says in a paper published wednesday by proceedings of the royal###society b . but remembering just a sound no visuals were included boggles even human###minds , he says . for bruck , 33 , it 's as if a long lost classmate from middle###school called him up and bruck would be able to figure out who it was just from the voice . faces , yes , yearbook pictures , definitely , but voices that change with time , no way , bruck says . we 're not as acoustically as adept as dolphins , bruck says . it helps that dolphins have massive parts of the brain that are geared###toward sound . bruck thinks dolphins have the incredible memory because it could help them when they approach new dolphins on a potential group hunt . and even more likely it probably allows dolphins to avoid others that had mistreated them in the past or dominated them , he says . male dolphins had a slightly better memory than females and that 's likely a case of worrying about dominance . some males would hear lucky or hastings , dominant###males , that they had n't###heard in years and they 'd react by going into an aggressive s posture or screaming their own signatures , bruck says . outside dolphin researchers praised the work , saying the next effort is to see whether somehow the dolphins visualize their old buddies when they hear the whistle . bruck says he is working on that . the study raises some very interesting###questions and hints at the wider importance of long###term social memory in nonhuman mammals and suggests there are strong parallels between dolphin and human social###recognition , said dolphin researcher stephanie king at the university of st . andrews in scotland .
milton , ga . showing again it 's more than just a football school , alabama won its first national###championship in men 's golf on sunday , routing illinois 4 1 in the match###play final and making up for a runner up finish last year . bobby wyatt got the crimson###tide off to a strong start in the first match at capital###city club 's crabapple course north of atlanta . he won the first seven holes on the way to a 6 and 5 blowout of thomas detry . alabama also got comfortably ahead in the final###match as cory whitsett went 5 up by the turn and cruised to a###4 and 3 victory over alex burge . the middle three matches were much tighter each of them all square at one point coming down the stretch , giving illinois a glimmer###of###hope at improbably pulling out its first national###title . but trey mullinax , after squandering chances to pull ahead with three putts at the 14th and 16th , two putted from 60 feet for a par at the 18th for a 1 up victory over charlie danielson . the illinois player missed the green with his approach , chipped up to about 10 feet , but rolled the putt past the right lip of the cup for a bogey . when mullinax knocked down his 3 footer , a huge roar went up from the predominantly alabama crowd that could be heard by the other groups still on the course . after that , it ended quickly . when burge missed a 15 foot par###putt at the 15th , he conceded whitsett 's short bogey attempt to end that match . up ahead on the 16th green , at essentially the same time , scott strohmeyer rolled in a 3 footer for par to beat brian###campbell 3 and . roll tide ! someone in the gallery shouted . thomas pieters , the 2012 individual###champion , earned the fighting###illini 's point with a 1 up victory over alabama 's top ranked###player , justin thomas . that was n't nearly enough to halt the tide , which had been on a mission ever since losing to texas in last year 's final . the victory came nearly five months after alabama routed notre###dame in college###football 's championship game , giving the school its third national###title in four years in the sport that dominates most of the attention on campus . but the tide 's athletic###program has won plenty of titles beyond the gridiron . over the last two academic years , alabama has also won national###championships in women 's golf , softball and gymnastics .
washington senate republicans continued a campaign to delay confirmation of president###obama 's second term cabinet nominees on thursday , blocking a committee###vote on gina mccarthy , the president 's pick to lead the environmental###protection###agency . the action came a day after republicans on the health , education , labor and pensions###committee threw a wrench in the nomination of thomas e . perez to be labor secretary , delaying it for at least a week . in both cases , republican committee members said the nominees had failed to adequately respond to their questions . the eight republicans on the environment and public works committee , led by the ranking###member senator david###vitter of louisiana , boycotted a committee meeting to protest what they called ms . mccarthy 's unresponsive answers to more than , 000 written questions about e.p.a . policies and internal practices . democrats were unable to muster a majority to move the nomination without any republicans present and were left to fulminate in a near empty committee room over what several of them called republican obstructionism . committee democrats are likely to regroup and try to approve ms . mccarthy 's nomination along party lines , but it is unclear whether they could clear a 60 vote threshold on the senate floor . senator harry###reid of nevada , the majority###leader , accused republicans of using procedural roadblocks and stall tactics to deny confirmation to qualified nominees . this type of blanket , partisan obstruction used to be unheard of , mr . reid said on the senate floor . now it has become an unacceptable pattern . he vowed that the senate would have an opportunity to vote on the nominations of mr . perez and ms . mccarthy . senator barbara###boxer , the california democrat who leads the environment panel , said that ms . mccarthy was one of the most qualified nominees ever named to lead the e.p.a . ms . mccarthy is currently head of the agency 's office of air and radiation , a post to which she won easy senate###confirmation in . she previously###served as a top environmental regulator in connecticut and massachusetts , working for democratic and republican governors . gina mccarthy deserves a vote , said ms . boxer , visibly angry . i have delayed a vote for three weeks . i was assured by senator vitter that once he received answers to , 000 questions a record breaking number they would allow us to move forward with the vote . ms . boxer and other committee democrats noted that republican members had submitted , 079 questions to ms . mccarthy , compared with 157 total questions for mr . obama 's first e.p.a . administrator , lisa p . jackson , and 305 for michael o . leavitt , who served in the post under president george w . bush . democrats boycotted a vote on mr . leavitt 's nomination in october , saying he had failed to adequately answer their questions on environmental###policy . the move forced a two week###delay in his confirmation . mr . vitter , in a letter to ms . boxer and at a news conference thursday , said that republicans were not seeking to obstruct the nomination or harass the nominee . these requests are all about openness and transparency and things required by law , mr . vitter told###reporters . we 're not asking the obama administration to walk away from their views on carbon or anything else . he said that the e.p.a . had been unresponsive to freedom###of###information###act###requests , that it had failed to provide scientific###data supporting regulations and that top officials had used aliases in e mail addresses , a practice now under review by the agency 's inspector###general . ms . boxer said she intended to press for a vote on ms . mccarthy , which she can do if all 10 democratic members of the committee appear in person . senator max###baucus of montana was at another hearing , and did not attend thursday 's meeting , nor did senator frank r . lautenberg of new jersey , who has been largely###absent from the senate in recent weeks because of health concerns . it was not my intention to vote this out with just democrats , ms . boxer said . i am asking my republican colleagues to come home , come back to your responsibility . if you want to be here and vote no , be here and vote no . that is your prerogative . but vote .
miami###gardens , fla . some days , the miami###dolphins ' owner , stephen ross , must wonder why he bought the team . since he took full control in , the dolphins have not had a winning###record , coaches and quarterbacks have come and gone , and season###ticket sales have dipped to a three decade low . this year , ross failed to win 200 million in subsidies to help overhaul the dolphins' stadium , and his fellow n.f.l . owners passed over miami to host the super###bowl in , 2017 and . ross took aim at lawmakers who refused to support the stadium deal . the local###news media then criticized ross for donating 200 million to his alma###mater , michigan . but these setbacks were a footnote compared with the unfolding and explosive story involving allegations of bullying and racial###discrimination on the team as it prepares for monday 's game against tampa###bay . richie###incognito , the team 's outspoken guard , has been suspended###indefinitely amid claims that he bullied his teammate jonathan martin , who has left the team . the n.f.l . has hired a high###profile lawyer to investigate conflicting###reports and publish his findings , which are likely to provide a rare###glimpse into n.f.l . locker###room culture . the public spat involving millionaire players who worked side by side on the dolphins' offensive###line has the potential to not only damage the team 's credibility , but also unleash a legal storm that could swirl around the team for months . what the story of jonathan martin teaches us is that the n.f.l . locker###room is in some ways no different than any other workplace in america , because all employers should proactively protect themselves against workplace###bullying , said nicholas reiter , a lawyer who represents employers for venable llp 's labor and employment group . employers are charged with running a workplace free of discrimination and harassment based on their workers' race , gender or other legally###protected characteristic . as part of their agreement with the n.f.l. , the dolphins have agreed not to talk about the case until the league has finished its review . incognito and martin have not sued the team , and it is unclear whether either one will take legal###action . the league 's collective###bargaining###agreement with the players could cover some claims that would be heard by an arbitrator . the two sides may be waiting until ted wells , a top defense lawyer , publishes his report , though he has no deadline for doing so . the report could be a big###moment in the bargaining###power of one side or another , reiter said . wells has led other special###investigations in sports . he was hired by the n.b.a . players union to look into allegations of inappropriate financial###dealings within it . his report led to the ouster of billy hunter , the union 's chief . this has raised the specter that coaches and some team officials may be accused of wrongdoing and perhaps dismissed . in theory , n.f.l . commissioner roger###goodell , who punished the new orleans saints for operating a bounty system that rewarded players for hurting opponents , could penalize the dolphins , though the cases are different . while incognito has been largely###silent , martin hired david cornwell , who has represented other athletes . on thursday , cornwell said in a statement that martin 's toughness was not at issue , only his treatment by his teammates . jonathan endured harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker###room hazing , he wrote . amid all the turmoil , ross has kept a low###profile . last week , he said the team would cooperate with wells 's investigation . as the owner , i am committed to creating a professional environment for all of the members of the dolphins family , he said . the circus surrounding the dolphins could derail their chance of making the playoffs for the first time since . to get back on track , the dolphins signed several big name free###agents in the off season , including wide###receiver mike###wallace . at the midway###point in the season , the team is , a half game behind the jets for the second a.f.c . wild###card spot . now the players and coaches will have to answer###questions by wells and his team of investigators , as well as from a bevy of reporters , an unwelcome intrusion .
football without alex###ferguson ? like britain without the queen or gin without tonic , it seems almost unthinkable . yet that will be the reality from sunday when british football 's most successful manager walks away after his , 500th and final###match in charge of manchester united . surely , the only ones not feeling twinges of sadness will be the die###hard haters who looked on enviously as this most driven of men turned united into england 's dominant club , eclipsing liverpool , and becoming a global sporting force . it would be a stretch to argue that it will take 26 years to stop feeling nostalgic about ferguson 's 26 years at united . but nor can the mourning be quick . nostalgia can be dangerous . it could make us gloss over , perhaps even forgive , those many times when ferguson was simply unpleasant , bullying referees and spitting venom at journalists . but , often , you also do n't###properly value what you have until it is gone . that will be true of ferguson . here are 10 reasons the list could be longer why ferguson 's absence in the red devils' dugout will be sorely felt next season . 1 . because he is a miserable so and so . his moodiness made him so interesting . one could never be sure which ferguson you 'd see the kindly , wise###cracking fatherly figure with an infectious laugh ? or the hair trigger temper itching for confrontation ? ferguson 's bluntness for instance , calling real###madrid that mob and saying i would n't###sell them a virus was like cool###water for parched throats in a business whose stars so often say nothing of interest . his jekyll###and###hyde personality made ferguson a bio pic waiting to be filmed . anthony###hopkins might be good as ferguson , because he does charming and terrifying so well . now , without ferguson setting the tone , will other managers become less inclined to also speak their minds ? 2 . for his joy . even into his seventies , ferguson celebrated goals and victories with the pure , unadulterated , bounce up and down excitement of a kid . ferguson hugging whoever he could , thrusting his fists skyward and beaming a million watt smile has been one of football 's great sights . he was n't triumphalist , sliding theatrically on his knees like jose mourinho . unlike some cold fish managers , ferguson did n't simply react to goals by scribbling a few words in a notebook . 3 . for football , bloody hell . why is this sport so engrossing ? because outcomes are never guaranteed . united pulled off one of the most dramatic comebacks ever , in any sport , when it scored twice in two minutes of injury time to defeat bayern###munich 2 1 in the champions###league final in . ferguson 's breathless , immortal football , bloody hell ! perfectly summed up the feat and the sport 's addictive wow factor . 4 . for giving vent to the genius of eric###cantona . oh , ah , cantona . a legend whose gifts to ferguson 's united included not just goals and strutting , winning personality , but also possibly football 's most memorable quote when the seagulls follow the trawler , it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea . thanks , sir alex , for not dispatching cantona off to exile in siberia for spouting such delightful nonsense and , more seriously , for his lunacy of kung###fu kicking a fan . would coaches today other than ferguson have the management skills to be able to handle a cantona like player and recognize their value ? 5 . for not letting players rule the roost . as players' salaries and celebrity went through the roof , ferguson made sure they did n't also get all the power . gordon###strachan recalled that when he played under ferguson at aberdeen , the manager made one of his footballers wear a balaclava in training because he ignored ferguson 's ban against players having their hair permed . angrily kicking a boot at david###beckham , cutting him above the left###eye after the midfielder and fashion maven swore at him in the united dressing###room , was excessive of ferguson . but at least he was consistent with the possible exception of cantona , ferguson left no doubt that he was the boss of his multimillionaire players , not the other way around . 6 . for 'fergie time . ' the idea that no game is won or lost until it ends is now locked into united 's dna . even under his successor , david###moyes , those extra minutes that ferguson would huff , puff and pressure match officials to grant so his team could get the result he wanted will still be fergie time . i love those last minute goals , ferguson said . 7 . for backing youth . if they are good enough , they are old enough , no matter what the age , ferguson said way back in his aberdeen days , before taking over at united in . a fine philosophy that brought much success . like drilling players to never say die before the final whistle , ferguson 's policy of hot housing , trusting and promoting young###footballers is also now woven into united 's fabric and business###model and should survive long after his retirement . 8 . for max lonsdale . the 18 year old , british media reported in , had the audacity to go to ferguson 's house and ring his buzzer to tell him that he wanted to play for united . instead of sending him packing , the manager let him in , told lonsdale he showed tremendous courage by daring to come to ferguson 's house and rewarded him with a month long trial at united , the daily###mail reported . nice . even as he joined the rich and powerful and got a knighthood from queen###elizabeth###ii , the shipyard worker 's son from govan on glasgow 's edge never seemed to lose his common###touch . 9 . for his loyalty to his wife , cathy . ferguson 's united could be summed up in a word silence . he ensured that much of what happened behind closed###doors at the club stayed behind closed###doors . that included banning journalists who reported things he wanted kept quiet or asked###questions that riled him . even in his last week as manager , ferguson said a part of my job is to keep us out of the news . but in explaining the reasons for his retirement at age , ferguson was forthright . he suggested on live###television that cathy needed him at home after the death of her sister , bridget . she 's isolated a lot now , he said . she 's lost her best friend . from a man so guarded professionally , this rang as a remarkable and touching declaration of affection and loyalty . 10 . because moyes is so like ferguson . in the transition from ferguson to moyes , much has been made of the two managers' similarities both scottish , both driven , both abrasive . but this could backfire on moyes , because it will make comparisons easier and perhaps make ferguson harder to forget . moyes will risk looking like an ersatz version of ferguson if he does n't quickly start winning trophies at a decent rate . united perhaps would have been wiser to have first chosen a manager cut from completely different cloth from ferguson for a few years before turning over the reins to his mini###me .
the commissioner of a junior###hockey###league said he would review its rules governing fights after a player had a seizure and was hospitalized following a fight saturday . i 'm convening a special meeting of our competition committee to see whether we 're being too tolerant of fighting , skip prince , the commissioner of the united###states###hockey###league , said sunday . last week , concussion researchers at the mayo###clinic called for a full ban on fighting in junior and professional hockey , partly because of the severe injuries that can be sustained in hockey fights . dylan chanter , an 18 year old defenseman with the dubuque###fighting###saints , fell backward and hit his bare head on the ice while fighting with corey petrash of the cedar###rapids###roughriders . the crowd at cedar###rapids ice arena cheered until chanter , whose helmet had been knocked off , started convulsing . his convulsions lasted two minutes as trainers attended to him . paramedics arrived about 15 minutes later and took chanter off the ice on a stretcher and to a hospital . he was later airlifted to an iowa###city hospital , where he was examined by a neurologist and released saturday###night . shortly before he was released , chanter wrote on twitter wanted to let everyone know i 'm awake and okay . thank you so much for all your thoughts prayers . nothing compares to the hockey community . chanter was resting at his residence in dubuque , iowa , under the observation of the team trainer , said dan lehv , the president of the fighting###saints . there was no timetable for his return . the game was suspended after the second period fight a date for finishing the game was not set . the u.s.h.l. , considered the top american###league at the junior###level , has tolerated fighting . many of its players go on to play in college , where fighting is curtailed . college players who fight are automatically ejected and suspended for the next game . chanter has committed to the university of new hampshire . dr . michael j . stuart of the mayo###clinic said sunday that chanter 's injury came very close to exactly what we as researchers feared . blows to the head from fists , and hitting your head on the ice from an unprotected fall with or without a helmet , can result in catastrophic injury or even death , said stuart , who is also the chief###medical###officer for usa###hockey . the time to stop fighting in junior###hockey is now .
during her second deployment###to###iraq , staff###sgt . stacy pearsall of the air###force found herself attached to an army ground unit that was clearing roadside###bombs . they had just found their 26th device of the day when one of their armored###personnel###carriers exploded . an ambush was on . the chaos that unfolded over the next few hours was not a typical day for sergeant pearsall . but under the pentagon 's decision to allow women into front line combat###units , officially###announced thursday , it could become much closer to the norm for women in american uniforms . as sergeant pearsall tells the story , her vehicle came under intense fire that day in , near the city of baquba . the male soldiers in her carrier had already dashed out to join the fight , so she jumped onto the machine###gun and began returning fire . outside a soldier lay unconscious . sergeant pearsall opened the rear###door and crawled to the man , who was 6 foot 2 and more than 200 pounds , twice her weight . from behind him , she clasped him in a bear###hug and dragged him toward the vehicle . she fell once , then again . somehow , she hauled him into the armored safety of the carrier . after tearing off his protective vest , she realized his carotid###artery had been torn by shrapnel . as blood spurted all over , she closed her eyes , stuck her fingers into his neck and squeezed . he screamed , and she thanked the heavens . he was still kicking . what happened next seemed almost cinematic . emerging from a purplish haze outside , a medic jumped into the carrier and set his kit beside her . are you a medic ? he asked . the question that now looms over the pentagon as it moves toward full gender integration is whether female service members like sergeant pearsall , for all their bravery under fire , can perform the same dangerous and physically demanding tasks day in and day out , for weeks at a time , as permanent members of ground combat###units like the infantry or armored###cavalry . since , women have technically been barred from serving in those front line units . but throughout the post 9 11 wars in iraq and afghanistan , women working as medics , intelligence officers , photographers , military###police officers and in a host of other jobs have been routinely attached to all male ground combat###units , where they have come under fire , returned fire , been wounded and been killed . to supporters of secretary of defense leon e . panetta 's decision to rescind the prohibition on women in combat , the experiences of those women proved that the distinction between being attached to a combat###unit and actually serving in one was outdated , and pointless . when the military goes to full integration , it allows commanders to put the best person in the job , not just the best man , said greg jacob , a former marine###corps officer who is now policy director for the service women 's action network , an advocacy###group for women in the military . if the best shot in the platoon is a woman , i can make her a sniper . but until now , i could n't do that . but to skeptics of the policy###change , it is one thing for women to perform well when they come under fire while temporarily###attached to all male combat###units . it is a far different thing , they argue , to carry out the daily mission of hunting down and engaging enemy forces as an infantry soldier or tank commander . representative duncan###hunter , republican of california and a marine###corps veteran with combat tours in iraq and afghanistan , defines it as a difference between incidental combat , as women have faced in convoys or attacks on bases , and the direct###combat duties of our advanced and most elite ground operators . representative hunter said in a statement , the question here is whether this change will actually make our military better at operating in combat , specifically finding and targeting the enemy . ask sergeant pearsall , who was decorated for her actions in baquba and received a medical retirement from the air###force in , and the answer is simple yes , women can do it , and i already have .
pittsburgh travis###snider hit a pinch hit grand###slam during a five run sixth and the pittsburgh###pirates spoiled a strong return to the mound for matt###garza with a 5 4 win over the chicago###cubs on tuesday###night . garza allowed one hit over five shutout###innings in his first outing in 10 months , but the pirates pounced on a chicago bullpen that is 10th in the national###league in era by sending 11 men to the plate in the sixth . snider 's first career###home###run with the bases###loaded was the first pirates pinch hit grand###slam in five years . garza had been sidelined since july 21 because of a stress reaction in his right elbow and , later , a strained upper back .. wandy rodriguez ( 5 2 ) allowed three runs on six hits over six innings for the pirates , who have won nine of . the cubs scored once in the ninthi , but anthony###rizzo struck out swinging with two on to end the game and earn jason###grilli his majors leading 18th save . darwin###barney went 4 for 4 for the cubs , who have lost three of four . the lone inning in which rodriguez allowed a runner to progress past first base was the second , when darwin###barney had an rbi single and garza hit a two run double . cubs pitchers have 13 rbis in may the most for the franchise in any month since september . they also have a major###league leading six doubles . but after that , rodriguez retired 13 of the final 15 he faced . justin###wilson worked around two hits in the seventh and mark###melancon pitched a scoreless eighth . barney tripled with one out in the ninth , and starlin###castro followed a julio borbon walk with an rbi single . but rizzo fell to 0 for 5 with his second strikeout of the game to end it , allowing grilli to surpass the new york yankees' mariano###rivera for the most saves in the majors . snider 's homer , his second , was the first pinch hit grand###slam by a pirates player since jason###michaels on june , 2008 , at st . louis . it came off of shawn###camp after hector rondon and james###russell had combined to load the bases and immediately following a pedro alvarez walk to drive in a run . the pirates did not have a hit against garza until clint###barmes singled to right with one out in the fifth . that followed a gaby sanchez walk and was followed by a rodriguez sacrifice . but jose tabata grounded out to end the inning . garza threw 82 pitches . after sitting out pittsburgh 's previous###game sunday due to knee soreness , andrew###mccutchen went 0 for . he made two of the pirates' three outs during the sixth , leaving the bases###loaded to end the inning . notes to make room for garza on the roster , the cubs earlier tuesday designated rhp michael bowden for assignment . also tuesday , chicago claimed rhp eduardo sanchez off waivers from the st . louis###cardinals and assigned him to the triple a iowa###cubs . ... the pirates reinstated rhp jose contreras from the bereavement list before the game and returned rhp jared hughes to triple a indianapolis . ... lhp francisco###liriano will make his third start for the pirates when the series continues wednesday . he has faced the cubs once in his eight year career . rhp jeff###samardzija , who has a . 92 era in 39 career innings vs . pittsburgh , starts for the cubs .

detroit a tense standoff between chrysler and federal###regulators over the safety of millions of jeep sport###utility###vehicles was resolved in one last high###level phone call . the call took place monday between sergio###marchionne , chrysler 's chief###executive , and david strickland , head of the national###highway###traffic###safety###administration , according to a person with knowledge of the call who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversation was private . when it was over chrysler had agreed to a voluntary campaign , announced on tuesday , to inspect and upgrade . 7 million jeeps that the government had claimed were prone to catastrophic fires in rear###end###collisions . the move by chrysler , the nation 's third largest automaker behind general###motors and ford , defused what had become an unusual confrontation between a car company and the nation 's auto safety agency after chrysler initially###rejected the recall . it also helped the automaker allay growing###concerns from its customers about the safety and quality of its popular jeep brand of vehicles . on monday 's call , mr . marchionne agreed that chrysler would voluntarily put trailer hitches on some older###model jeeps to protect them in the event of rear###end accidents . in return , mr . marchionne asked that regulators refrain from continuing to describe the vehicles as defective . that was a crucial###point for chrysler , which is seeking to avoid lawsuits generated by the safety agency 's three year investigation of the jeeps . mr . marchionne 's offer satisfied mr . strickland , whose agency had recommended in early###june that chrysler recall 1993 to 2004 jeep grand cherokees and 2002 to 2007 jeep###liberty sport###utility###vehicles . at issue was the placement of fuel tanks , and whether it made the s.u.v . 's vulnerable in collisions and prone to gasoline leaks and fires . though the chrysler data points to no flaws in their vehicles , the voluntary recalls show how important they want the drivers in their vehicles to feel###safe , said jared rowe , president of the auto research firm kelley###blue###book . in a statement on tuesday , chrysler again maintained that the jeeps are not defective and are among the safest of a group of similar sport###utility###vehicles made by other manufacturers . but the company said it now plans to inspect the jeeps included in the government 's original recall request and install the trailer hitches . chrysler group will conduct a voluntary campaign with respect to the vehicles in question that , in addition to a visual###inspection of the vehicle will , if necessary , provide an upgrade to the rear structure of the vehicle to better manage crash forces in low###speed impacts , the company said . the safety agency said in a statement that it was satisfied with the move without including any comments about whether the vehicles had defects . the national###highway###traffic###safety###administration 's top priority is safety , and the recall of vehicles when supported by our data , the agency said . as such , we are pleased that chrysler has agreed to take action to protect its customers and the driving public . the agency also said it would continue its investigation of the jeeps , including further review of new documents provided by chrysler . in its original recall letter to chrysler in early###june , the agency cited 32 rear impact collisions that caused fatal fires resulting in 44 deaths in grand cherokees , and five accidents that resulted in seven deaths in jeep libertys . but rather than agree to the recall , chrysler aggressively defended the jeeps . that set off a round of meetings between the company and regulators , comparing how jeeps fared in crashes with other s.u.v . models . as late as last week , it appeared that chrysler would formally refuse the recall by a tuesday deadline . the moves announced by chrysler on tuesday were a combination of a voluntary safety recall and a customer###service action , according to eric mayne , a company spokesman . essentially , the company is planning to install a factory built trailer hitch on any of the jeeps that do n't already have one . the hitches are somewhat common equipment used to tow a trailer , and have the added benefit of absorbing force when the vehicle is struck from the rear . analysts said chrysler was wise to choose voluntary safety actions over a protracted battle with the government . this is probably the right decision by chrysler , said michelle krebs , an analyst with the automotive site edmunds . com . once the smoke settles , i expect that this will be just a minor blip in jeep 's history .
many commercial###fishing stocks off the united###states coast that were depleted by decades of overfishing are returning to abundance , thanks largely to a 1996 law that effectively ordered limits on catches until the fish populations had rebounded , a newly###released analysis of federal data on fish populations states . the analysis , by the natural###resources###defense###council , concludes that 21 of 44 species that it studied have met rebuilding targets and 7 others have made significant###progress , increasing their populations by at least 25 percent . sixteen have made less or no progress , the report stated , including 10 species off the new england coast , most of them popular bottom dwelling fish like cod and flounder . in half of those cases , the fish populations had grown by more than 25 percent but were still being overfished . all have been managed under the 1996 law , the magnuson stevens fishery conservation and management act , which sets a 10 year target for rebuilding each species . brad###sewell , a lawyer for the resources group and the main author of the analysis , said the uptick in fish populations was especially impressive in light of what he called a dismal record in most other parts of the world . when you look at the population trajectories of dozens and dozens of stocks , you see '96 as a real watershed , he said . you see this cause and effect between implementing the law and the upward population trajectory . the report noted that between 2008 and , the average revenues from catches of the 28 fish that made the most rebuilding progress had jumped 54 percent , allowing for inflation , from the start of their rebuilding . the report 's calculations are based entirely on annual###reports on fish###stocks issued by the national###marine###fisheries###service . the service has labeled 124 species overfished , but the report focused on 44 for which there were enough data to draw###conclusions on their rebuilding progress . mid###atlantic fish###stocks reported the most progress all seven species examined had met population targets , including bluefish , black###sea bass and summer flounder . many new england stocks also recovered###fully , including sea scallops , haddock , monkfish and yellowtail flounder . but many other new england fish were recovering more slowly , mostly because of overfishing and environmental###problems , mr . sewell said . until recently , he said , new england regulators had set targets only for total catches instead of setting strict quotas under which any excess catch would be deducted from the following year 's quota . six of the eight species that made the least progress are off new england , including atlantic###cod , winter flounder and ocean pout . and even some species making slightly better progress , like the slow growing atlantic halibut , could take decades to rebuild , he said . they were the size of small###boats , and they virtually went extinct , he said . they 're coming back . but it will be a long###haul .
pittsburgh sidney###crosby scored three goals in 22 minutes for his second career###playoff hat###trick , leading the pittsburgh###penguins to a###4 3 victory over the ottawa###senators on friday###night . brenden###morrow added his first playoff###goal in more than five years , helping pittsburgh take a 2 0 series lead in the eastern###conference semifinal###series . crosby 's third goal , during a power play at 1 minute 15 seconds of the second period , sent craig###anderson , ottawa 's starting###goaltender , to the bench . anderson , who had stopped 18 of 21 shots , was replaced by robin###lehner . he 's one of the best in the game , ottawa defenseman chris###phillips said of crosby , and if you give him time , space to make plays , to shoot the puck , he 's going to burn you . kyle###turris , colin greening and jean###gabriel pageau scored for the senators , who have never won a playoff###series after losing the first two games . the senators insisted they did not have to play a perfect###game against pittsburgh , pointing to the way they controlled play at even strength for long stretches in a###4 1 loss in the series opener tuesday . they said they would be in good shape if they stayed out of the penalty###box and scored when they had a man advantage . in the first period of game , ottawa killed two penalties and got a power###play###goal from turris , and they still trailed , 2 1 . more to the point , they trailed crosby , 2 1 . crosby , the penguins' captain , became the franchise 's fifth player with 100 playoff###points . less than four minutes into the game , he collected a pass at the pittsburgh blue line and darted up the left side . he split two senators , including the norris###trophy winning defenseman erik###karlsson , and ripped a shot under anderson for a 1 0 lead . turris tied the score when he banked the puck off penguins goalie tomas vokoun at 15 . it was the first soft goal vokoun had allowed since taking over for marc###andre fleury in game 5 of pittsburgh 's first round series against the islanders . crosby one upped turris a few minutes later , zipping down the left side once again . this time , crosby appeared to be looking to pass to his linemate pascal###dupuis as they raced toward anderson . but at the last moment , crosby flipped a wrist shot near the goal###line that smacked off anderson 's pad and into the net . i was kind of running out of space to make a pass , crosby said . i was hoping that it was able to find a way somehow . crosby recorded his first postseason hat###trick since 2009 by powering a slap###shot over anderson 's glove from the left circle to push pittsburgh 's lead to . greening responded almost immediately after ottawa 's goalie switch , beating vokoun with a wrist shot 40 seconds later to cut the senators' deficit to . but morrow restored a two goal pittsburgh lead by redirecting a blast from paul###martin . despite morrow 's goal , the 21 year old lehner was stellar in his playoff###debut . of his 20 saves , several were point###blank stops . shortly after replacing anderson , he robbed jarome###iginla on a two on one .

( reuters ) a u.s . appeals###court on friday upheld the felony conviction of baseball home###run king barry###bonds for obstruction###of###justice over his testimony to a grand###jury probing the sale of steroids . the 9th u.s . circuit###court###of###appeals said the former san###francisco###giants slugger had been evasive and misleading when he told grand jurors in 2003 about his childhood in response to a question about whether his former trainer , greg###anderson , had given him self injectable substances . bonds had been testifying under a grant of immunity , and denied knowingly using steroids or any performance###enhancing###drugs ( peds ) provided by the bay###area###laboratory###co###operative , known as balco , or by anderson . after talking about his friendship with the trainer , bonds , a son of former baseball star bobby###bonds , had testified i was a celebrity child , not just in baseball by my own instincts . i became a celebrity child with a famous father . i just do n't get into other people 's business because of my father 's situation . while bonds eventually said he had not received self injectable substances , circuit###judge mary schroeder wrote for a unanimous three judge appeals###court panel that his response could have influenced the grand###jury into minimizing anderson 's role in the distribution of illegal steroids and peds . grand jurors had been examining whether proceeds from sales of the drugs were being laundered . the statement served to divert the grand###jury 's attention away from the relevant inquiry of the investigation , which was anderson and balco 's distribution of steroids and peds , the judge wrote . the statement was therefore evasive . in upholding bonds' april 2011 conviction , the 9th circuit , which heard the case in san###francisco , also rejected his contentions that the statute under which he was convicted did not apply to grand###jury###testimony and was unconstitutionally###vague . we are gratified by the court 's decision , and believe justice is served , said u.s . attorney melinda haag in san###francisco . it was unclear whether bonds would appeal friday 's decision . his sentence of two years of probation and 30 days of home###confinement was put on hold pending the appeal of his conviction . bonds' jury had deadlocked on three perjury counts . dennis riordan , who argued bonds' appeal , did not immediately respond to requests for comment . paul haagen , a duke###university law professor and director of its center for sports###law and policy , said the decision to try bonds reflected increased impatience among authorities to rely too heavily on drug###testing to uncover and deter ped use . users are becoming more sophisticated in avoiding detection , and one response among sports organizations and governments has been to rely on investigations in addition to drug###testing , he said . this decision reflects that celebrities and athletes are not going to be given a pass . bonds last played in , and is major###league###baseball 's regular###season home###run leader with . he also holds the single###season###record with 73 in , and won the national###league 's most###valuable###player###award a record seven times . but suspicions over drugs tarnished his legacy , and voters in january denied him and former star pitcher roger###clemens entry to baseball 's hall of fame in their first year of eligibility . a jury in washington , d.c. , acquitted clemens in june 2012 of lying to congress by denying that he used peds . bonds and clemens are the most prominent###players to have been tried in connection with baseball 's so called steroid era . bonds had testified that he received flaxseed oil , creams , vitamins and protein shakes from anderson . among the other athletes linked to balco was former track star marion###jones , who gave up her five medals from the 2000 summer###olympics after admitting in october 2007 that she lied to federal###investigators about whether she used peds .
frankfurt sometimes it is more fun to dream about the future than to dwell on the present , especially if you are a european car executive . with sales at their lowest###level in two decades , auto###industry managers gathering for the frankfurt auto show next week will be doing their best to focus on shiny new technologies rather than on the european car market , which , in contrast to the thriving###market in the united###states , is in a terrible state . the buzz at the show , which opens to the public next saturday , is likely to be about new battery powered###cars and vehicles that are able to drive themselves . those are more cheerful topics than auto###sales , which have fallen 20 percent in western###europe since the financial###crisis began in 2008 and are at their lowest###level since . only european carmakers with substantial sales in the united###states or china bmw , mercedes and volkswagen have escaped relatively unscathed . the emphasis on technology is more than just a distraction from market misery . carmakers are desperate for ways to excite young buyers , who are increasingly apathetic about car###ownership . the push toward cars that are rechargeable and loaded with software is part of a search to make automobiles as essential to young###adults as smartphones . otherwise , there is a big risk that auto###sales may never reach their previous peaks even if the european economy keeps improving . there are products that are hipper for young people than cars , said ferdinand dudenh ffer , a professor at the university###of###duisburg###essen in northern###germany and an industry analyst . the car companies are still using the old marketing pitch more horsepower . that does n't###speak to young people any more . interest in battery powered###cars has faded after disappointing initial###sales , but it could pick up again this year with the market introduction of the bmw i . the vehicle has perhaps the most revolutionary new design by an established carmaker in years , not only because of its electric###propulsion system but also because the passenger###compartment is made of carbon###fiber rather than steel , to save###weight and extend the distance the car can travel between charges . there is also speculation that continental , a german parts###supplier , will announce an alliance with google next week to further develop self driving###cars . a spokesman for continental , which will hold a news conference at the auto show on tuesday , declined to comment . as such initiatives illustrate , it is no longer enough for a car to take a person from one place to another without breaking down . a car must be green , so the owner does not feel###guilty driving it . and being in the car should not interrupt the perpetual connectivity that many younger people take for granted . bmw is going to extremes to make the i3 the most carbon###neutral car on the road . a wind###turbine outside the bmw factory in leipzig provides power for the i3 assembly###line , and the carbon###fiber for the passenger###compartment comes from a factory in washington###state that uses hydropower . and of course the i3 itself has no tailpipe emissions ( unless buyers choose a range###extender version that has a small gasoline motor . with a price of about , 000 in the united###states , the i3 will be an option only for higher###end buyers when it arrives in showrooms by the middle of next year , though government###incentives could lower the price by more than , 000 . but since bmw 's clientele already tends to be wealthy and urban , the company may be in a better position than other carmakers to find a market . what the mobile###phone did for communication , electric###mobility will do for individual mobility , norbert reithofer , the chief###executive of bmw , said during an introduction event for the i3 in new york in july . despite mr . reithofer 's enthusiasm , no one expects battery powered###cars to sell in large###numbers soon , and certainly not to solve the industry 's deep###seated problems . about , 000 electric###vehicles were sold in the united###states in the last 12 months , far more than in any other country , according to roland###berger strategy consultants in munich . that number , which includes cars like the chevy volt that have range###extender motors , is tiny compared with the . 5 million###cars of all types sold in the united###states last year . modest expectations may also be in order for self driving###cars . cars are coming on the market that can relieve drivers of some of the tedium of driving in traffic or on the highway . the latest###edition of the mercedes###benz###s###class , introduced this year , can steer and brake autonomously in traffic or on the autobahn .
paris while the celebration of andy###murray continued across the english###channel , marion###bartoli , the other wimbledon singles champion this year , was back on the french side . la###reine de wimbledon ( the queen of wimbledon , read an advertisement for a french sunday paper that was still posted in a newspaper kiosk in the 16th arrondissement . on tuesday###night , she took questions and compliments on french radio as the rmc host in paris kept replaying the audio###clip of her ace on match###point against sabine###lisicki . i have no sense of vindication , bartoli said . i only feel i have managed to reach the goal of my career , of a life , of a child who was 6 or 7 years old in a little club in a village of , 000 people who dreamed that one day perhaps she will lift up this trophy . and when you 've dreamed for more than 20 years and trained for that and then you have made it , that is a moment that will stay engraved in your memory . it is happiness in pure###form . bartoli 's deeply surprising###victory was uplifting . it was touching , and it was also good listening , because with her intelligence and sensitivity , she was more than capable of putting words to the moment and of deflecting insensitive remarks with a sharp###wit instead of outrage . but do n't think for a minute that it was a french###revolution . her double handed groundstrokes off both sides are not now going to become a staple of future###champions , and bartoli herself back to no . 7 in the rankings at age 28 is not suddenly in a position to rule the power and leverage game that is still women 's tennis . serena###williams will be back in action soon . so will maria###sharapova and , if her sore hip and knee cooperate , victoria###azarenka . so will all the other young , hungry and more athletically gifted talents on the rise . but that is no slight on bartoli , who , even without a solid season behind her , saw her opportunity and seized it with panache and without dropping a set . i think in the middle of the tournament , when all the favorites had lost , i think she told herself , 'this is my chance , this is really my chance , ' said gilbert ysern , the french###open tournament director , who was in the stands for the final . and i think it shows her strength that she was able to know it and then do it . that 's also a talent . bartoli , as has been noted , is a bespoke wimbledon champion . her game is full of quirks and artisanal touches a product of independent reflection rather than the herd academy mentality a product of working with her father and coach , walter , outside the french national system , too . but she did have powerful outside influences , above all monica###seles , the double handed yugoslavian who did revolutionize the women 's game in the early 1990s by striking the ball early and aggressively off both the forehand and the backhand ( and , less fortuitously , by popularizing the grunt , more accurately described as the shriek . bartoli 's father copied seles 's two handed forehand after he and his then 7 year old daughter watched seles beat steffi###graf in a thriller of a 1992 french###open final . the first time at age 5 and a half , when i took a racket in my hands and my father fed me some balls , i made 50 backhands in a row , did n't###miss a single one , bartoli said in a recent interview . but my forehand , i had no strength in my arm and the wrist . with one hand , i did nothing but miss . the second hand la seles would solve the problem , and bartoli said she still would not be able to hit an effective one handed forehand , even as an adult . but from bartoli 's arrhythmic , straight take back on her serve , to her waggle of the racket before a return to her avant###garde training###methods , she has clearly become bartoli and nobody but bartoli , which is quite refreshing , even if some of her tics have lost her a few fans along the way . tennis needed a true surprise about now , and bartoli , the thoughtful and proud frenchwoman with corsican roots , was arguably the biggest###surprise wimbledon women 's champion since 17 year old maria###sharapova then seeded 13th stormed the castle in . but sharapova was clearly a player on the rise before that tournament . bartoli , a former finalist at wimbledon , was not clearly a player on the rebound . i can really express my game much better on grass , but it 's true that my level changed fast , bartoli said . and it even surprised me , to be honest , how fast it changed .
selectors to the pro###football###hall###of###fame must decide saturday whether art###modell 's moving his team from cleveland to baltimore in 1996 should undermine his more than four decades of handiwork that helped the n.f.l . to prominence . modell , who died sept . 6 at , is among 15 finalists being considered by a 46 person selection###committee the day before the ravens the name his team adopted after the browns' nickname and colors were left with cleveland meet the san###francisco 49ers in super###bowl xlvii . bill parcells , who coached the giants and the jets , among others , and the former 49 ers owner ed debartolo jr . are the other nonplayers being considered . tackle jonathan###ogden , modell 's initial first round###draft###choice for the ravens , is among four first time nominees , joining guard larry###allen , defensive###tackle warren###sapp and defensive###end michael###strahan . other players under consideration are running back jerome###bettis wide###receivers tim###brown , cris###carter and andre###reed guard will shields defensive###end charles###haley linebacker kevin###greene and cornerback aeneas###williams . four to seven finalists will be inducted . no finalist is likely to stir as much emotion as modell when his worthiness for a bust in canton , ohio , is debated . the giants owner john###mara said it was unfortunate and unfair that modell was not enshrined while alive . modell was previously a finalist in . i can think of very few others who had the dramatic###effect on the growth of the league that art###modell had for many years , mara said . modell , who was born in brooklyn and dropped out of high###school at 15 to support his family after the death of his father , is best known for his work as the league 's broadcast chairman , among numerous accomplishments . he negotiated television agreements from 1962 to '93 that played a huge role in increasing the popularity of the sport and was heavily###involved in the creation of monday###night###football . that apparently means little to greg brinda , who hosts a sports###talk show on wknr in cleveland . he grew up as a browns fan and will never forget the day modell left town . i do n't think you could commit a greater sin against a fan###base , he said . time does not appear to be healing the wound created when modell announced his decision shortly before a referendum passed overwhelmingly to provide public money to renovate aging municipal###stadium . when modell died , the browns were the only team not to offer a game day tribute to him . mike###holmgren , then the team president , canceled plans at the request of the mourning family , which feared a backlash . the ravens have worn patches on their uniforms that read art . tony grossi , who has reported on the browns since , is asking fans what position he should take as cleveland 's representative on the selection###committee . the response has been overwhelming in volume and pretty lopsided , he said . they still feel the same way . they want me to speak against his hall of fame nomination . grossi was vigorously opposed before this . i covered art in good times and bad###times , grossi said . i felt the one act of moving the team when he did , and the way he did it , obscures all of the good he did . it was a severe blow to cleveland , its fan###base , its tradition , the league itself . it was a gigantic black###eye , and i do n't know what changed to characterize that any differently . although numerous###reports indicated that modell headed to baltimore to put heavy financial###losses behind him , his son , david , does not wish to delve into the circumstances that led sports###illustrated to run a dec . 4 , 1995 , cover that depicted a caricature of modell punching a browns mascot in the gut . the move story has been told and retold so many times , and it 's been pretty clear that he agonized over the decision , david modell said . while the ravens won the super###bowl during the 2000 season , the pain did not ease for cleveland fans , who were without a team for three seasons . the new browns have at times not appeared to be n.f.l . caliber . plagued by instability , the browns have had two winning###seasons and one playoff###berth since they returned to the field in . the indians have not won the world###series since . the cavaliers will always be associated with their inability to retain the ohio native lebron###james . the history modell 's supporters emphasize demonstrates the profound###effect he had in elevating the n.f.l . he led the owners labor committee in 1968 when it negotiated the first collective###bargaining###agreement with the players . he broke an impasse that made the n.f.l . merger with the american###football###league possible by agreeing to shift the browns to the a.f.c . he helped###establish n.f.l . films and was its first chairman . he hired the first black general###manager , ozzie###newsome , whose eye for talent has helped the ravens advance to the playoffs a###league high five straight###seasons , culminating in this super###bowl appearance . we are hopeful for a big raven weekend with art in a virtual yellow###jacket and the team with a new trophy , david modell said . for unforgiving browns fans , it would be their second worst###nightmare .

the billions###of###dollars in tax###breaks granted to the nation 's nonprofit hospitals are being challenged by regulators and politicians as cities still reeling from the recession watch cash rich medical###centers expand . hospitals , among the largest###landowners in many communities , are often designated as nonprofits , allowing them to benefit from state and federal tax###breaks for providing charity care and community benefit . the exemptions collectively amount to more than 12 billion###annually , health economists say . now , provisions of the affordable###care###act , along with internal###revenue###service reporting###requirements imposed in recent###years , are revealing how much medical###centers give back to their communities . and many health experts have found them wanting . you should get close to the value of tax###exemption in community benefit , said paula song , professor of health###services organization at ohio###state###university . i think you 'll find most hospitals are n't providing that . a study this year in the new england journal of medicine found that hospitals spent an average of . 5 percent of their operating###costs on charity care and community benefit , based on filings the i.r.s . has required only since . some spent under 1 percent and others about 20 percent . what 's more , the i.r.s . allows hospitals to use broad definitions of community###service , including the value of traditional charity care dispensed free or at a discount to those who cannot pay and the money hospitals calculate they lose because medicaid reimburses them less than their costs . hospitals can also take credit for hosting health fairs , operating some research###labs and donating their executives' time to serve on local###community boards . nonprofit hospitals may have been founded on the basis of community need but that does n't mean they 're not very profitable , said gary young , an author of the new england journal of medicine article and a professor at northeastern###university . towns are hurting and they see this affluent institution in their midst on lots of land and say , 'hey , cough up some money . melinda hatton , general###counsel of the american###hospital###association , said that all hospitals have a financial###assistance program for the poor , and that they provide###services like training new physicians and treating medicaid patients who have no other doctors . tax###exempt hospitals devote the money they would pay in tax to the health of the community , she said . i hope cities do n't undervalue that . the federal###government has not specified the amount of benefit a hospital should provide to be exempt from federal###taxes , though their status will now be subject to review every three years under the new health###care law . but states and cities are already poised to make demands , said john d . colombo , a professor of tax###law at the university###of###illinois###urbana champaign . in a case that is being closely###watched , pittsburgh this year filed###suit challenging the university###of###pittsburgh###medical###center 's tax###exempt###status , saying that the medical center should pay some payroll###taxes and more property###taxes , estimated to total about 20 million###annually . its commitment to charity is dwarfed by its preoccupation with profits , e . j . strassburger , the city 's lead lawyer on the case , wrote in a letter to the city solicitor . he said that the hospital failed most , if not all , of pennsylvania 's criteria for a tax###exempt charity , and that its annual###report described it as a 10 billion global###health enterprise , with excess operating###revenue of nearly 1 billion and reserves of more than 3 billion . the institution paid 20 executives more than 1 million###annually , he said . despite a charity policy , the hospital made little effort to take care of poor people except in emergencies , he asserted , spending only about 2 percent of its net patient revenues on charity care . the hospital does not dispute that figure but says it is being misconstrued . it acknowledges spending about 87 million about 2 percent in donated care for patients who qualify for financial###assistance . but it says that it effectively donates about another 150 million when accounting for medicaid shortfalls and patients who did not pay###bills , and that it contributes to the city in other ways , like financing college###scholarships for public###school students . the medical center which has countersued says that the city is abusing tax laws in singling it out since it is following rules for nonprofits . but many experts argue that most hospitals today do not deserve their tax###exempt###status . the standard nonprofit hospital does n't act like a charity any more than microsoft does they also give some stuff away for free , professor colombo said . hospitals' primary###purpose is to deliver high###quality health###care for a fee , and they 're good at that . but do n't try to tell me that 's charity . they price like a business . they make acquisitions like a business . they are businesses . the exact value of tax benefits is difficult to estimate for any particular hospital , but the benefits include exemptions from federal and state taxes , local###property###taxes and sales###taxes , said simone###singh , a professor of health management at the university of michigan . many tax experts say that , at the very least , more stringent reporting###standards are needed to ensure that tax###exempt hospitals fulfill their mandate . under current###practices , they say , hospitals can overstate the value of the charity care they provide by subtracting the fees they collect from their estimated###costs , which are highly###subjective . if a hospital forgives a , 000 bill for three stitches for a poor patient , how much of that should be counted as charity if the charges are greatly inflated ? some patients who are hard###pressed to pay today 's high charges found that hospitals can be aggressive in bill collection . when david dicola , 61 , went to roger###williams medical center in providence , r.i. , for treatment of a finger infection , the bill was about , 500 . uninsured , he offered the hospital it refused his offer and sent it to a collection###agency , he said . after oliver nisch , 49 , of san###francisco , was hit by a car that ran a red###light last year , he spent about 12 hours in the emergency###room at san###francisco###general###hospital . when the driver 's insurance took a long time to pay , the hospital began billing him for , 000 , an amount he said he could not pay his health###insurance policy has a deductible of , 000 . the hospital , he said , sent him a reduced bill of , 000 and went after me like crazy . the new england journal of medicine study found that religious hospitals provided no more benefit to their communities than nonreligious ones , but that major teaching###hospitals provided somewhat more though that tended to come in the form of hard to quantify services , rather than direct patient care . for example , on its 2011 tax form , johns###hopkins###hospital said it spent about 11 percent of revenues on charity care and community benefit , but only about 2 percent was on free or discounted treatment . more than half was spent on educating health###care###professionals it did not take any credit for treating medicaid patients or research . by contrast , the cleveland###clinic said that nearly 14 percent of its revenue was spent on activities that would qualify . but two thirds of that was for professional education and research , and it did claim credit for its so called medicaid shortfall . there are many gray areas , dr . young said . is there manipulation ? absolutely .

zhongshe , china a moribund coal###mine here descends deeply , more than , 800 feet underground . but the deal in which a chinese state owned conglomerate bought it may be even darker and more labyrinthine . the zhongshe mine and two others , in shanxi###province in northern###china , are at the center of unusually public accusations of mismanagement and corruption afflicting one of the nation 's flagship state conglomerates , china###resources . critics say that the . 6 billion purchase was vastly overpriced and illegal and that large###sums may have been squandered or , as some are claiming , improperly diverted . leaked###documents about the deal , and a court###case in hong###kong , have shed an unusually harsh light on the usually secretive workings of a major state###owned###company . the disputed deal raises a stark question are china 's economy and resources held###hostage by privileged state corporations and their executives , who can use influence and gain###access to easy credit in ways that undermine long###term growth ? the dispute has become a chief exhibit in a debate in china about the wisdom of investing so much of the nation 's money in state###owned###companies , especially when china 's economy has slowed . for the communist###party leadership , the case distills concerns about the grip that state owned conglomerates exert . the problems for china###resources began in , when its affiliates as well as a partner state company agreed to pay . 9 billion renminbi . 6 billion ) for the three coal###mines and related assets , according to documents submitted to a hong###kong court . the seller was a businessman , zhang xinming , a man with a reputation as a swashbuckling gambler , who also gained a 20 percent###stake in the new joint###venture . the deal appeared to give china###resources a foothold in the coal industry here in shanxi , the hub of china 's coal industry for more than a century and close to the energy hungry cities and factories on the coast . but the company 's monthly business operations statements show that since the mines changed###hands in , the mines have not produced any coal . legally speaking , this was a totally abnormal transaction , said chen ruojian , a lawyer with the duan duan law###firm in beijing . mr . chen is helping to represent the minority###shareholders in hong###kong , where the subsidiary behind the deal , china###resources power holdings , is listed on the stock###exchange . it 's impossible to understand why they 'd do this pay so much for mines with expired exploration licenses , he said . state###owned###companies have all sorts of problems , but we think it 's rare to have something as stark as china###resources . political unease over the case grew after two chinese journalists made accusations of corruption about the deal , and one singled out song lin , the chairman of the parent conglomerate , china###resources . the web###site of people 's daily , the communist###party 's newspaper , has reported that the party 's discipline unit has received an accusation of corruption against mr . song and other senior###executives at china###resources and is processing the complaint . mr . song has not been detained or charged with any wrongdoing , judging from the reports on the company 's web###site of his various public appearances . china###resources has denied###wrongdoing and has hinted it might take legal###action against chinese journalists who have raised corruption accusations . china###resources is a major global player , said david zweig , a specialist in chinese natural###resource companies at the hong###kong###university###of###science###and###technology . if the claims about the coal###mines are proved###true , he added , it would show that these companies can be ripped off or tricked . it does n't bode well for the globalization or professionalization of these companies . china###resources traces its roots to the days of mao###zedong 's revolution , when it was established in 1938 in hong###kong to raise###money and buy military supplies to support communist forces . by 2012 it was china 's 18th largest state owned industrial company by sales , with revenue of 52 billion . its wide ranging products include medicine and beer , coal and real###estate . its chairman , mr . song , holds the same government rank as a vice###minister . the controversy over the coal deal has made china###resources a lightning###rod for criticism of all state###owned###enterprises , which produce about two fifths of the nation 's economic###output .

( reuters ) teenager matthew###fitzpatrick became the first englishman to win the u.s . amateur###championship in 102 years after he defeated australian oliver goss in the 36 hole final on sunday . the baby faced 18 year old from sheffield , whose younger###brother acted as his caddie , sunk a par###putt on the 33rd hole to close out a###4 3 victory in the matchplay format tournament held at the country###club in brookline , massachusetts . i mean , it 's absolutely amazing , said fitzpatrick , who won the title on the same course where amateur francis###ouimet claimed his famous u.s . open victory in a playoff against harry###vardon and ted###ray a century ago . i ca n't really describe how i 'm feeling at the minute . that 's sort of what everyone wants in golf , wants to achieve , and i 'm pretty sure justin###rose said that after his u.s . open that it 's nice to go down in the history books . rose became the first englishman in 43 years to win the u.s . open when he won his first major at the merion###golf###club in june . the amateur , who grabbed attention last month when he won the silver###medal at the british###open as leading###amateur , ended england 's wait for a victory in the tournament since harold###hilton lifted the trophy in . the win earns fitzpatrick , who is soon to begin a golf scholarship at northwestern###university in chicago where former world number one and fellow briton luke###donald studied , an exemption into the 2014 u.s . open provided he remains an amateur . he is also exempt from next year 's british###open and is likely to receive an invitation to the u.s . masters at augusta . fitzpatrick led the 19 year old goss by one after the morning round but the australian tied the match on the opening hole of the second when his opponent missed a seven foot par###putt . the englishman , who came into the event as the number two ranked amateur in the world , won the next two holes to take the lead for good . i 'd probably say this week what 's come out most is that my short game has just been really , really top drawer , fitzpatrick said . i 'd say my weakest part of my game was into the greens . what 's come out more than anything is i 've just putted really well .
london you believe winning has nothing to do with lucky###charms , and that losing cannot be blamed on a curse ? me , too . but how do we explain chelsea ? the london club contradicts conventional thinking with its habit of appearing to be outplayed in european finals but emerging###victorious , as it did wednesday###night against benfica in the europa###league final , just as it did last year against bayern###munich in the champions###league final . to be sure , there is a winning gene in chelsea . its owner , roman###abramovich , mocks the theory that stability in the coaching department is essential to a team 's success . the russian will soon make his 10th coaching###change in 10 years . in those years , he has put 11 trophies in a cabinet that was bare before he bought the club . those trophies are not trinkets . abramovich and his chelski have won the full set of cups representing every competition open to them . with each change of team management comes an expensive and inevitable change of personnel on the field . however , the core of the side winning all that silverware remains goalkeeper petr cech , defender ashley###cole and , arguably the pillar of it all , the captain wednesday###night , frank###lampard . there has to come a time when lampard will be phased out of the team . his game is built on industry , on running between defense and attack , and on a desire to score match winning goals . but he will turn 35 in june , and chelsea 's higher management had indicated that there would be no new contract for lampard after this season . that changed with a new one year deal signed thursday . it is john###terry , the club 's usual captain , who keeps on missing the big nights through either injury or suspension , and it is lampard who leads in his stead . lampard 's perseverance has now run through more than 800 matches , and he has just eclipsed the all time record of bobby###tambling 's 202 goals in a chelsea shirt . tambling played less than half the games , 370 , through the 1960s . but scoring was his purpose he was an out and out striker . lampard is something else , an athlete covering more territory in an era when the sport has speeded up beyond recognition from tambling 's time . the financial###rewards , too , are incomparable . it will cost chelsea millions to keep lampard , but that price was agreed to after he led the team back into the top four in england , and to the europa###league trophy . he did not score wednesday , but he struck the crossbar . the goals came from fernando###torres and , after benfica had equalized through an scar cardozo penalty , on a header from chelsea defender bransilav ivanovic in the third and final###minute of added time . that winning header summed up ivanovic , a serb who never ceases to fight to win a game . it came from a corner , forced by ramires , a fighter who never ceases to chase . ivanovic is a big###man , but when he leaped off the ground , two defenders andr almeida and jardel were feeble bystanders at his side . the header looped beyond the reach of the benfica goalkeeper artur the final was won and lost . chelsea had prevailed through a never say die team spirit against an opponent that out passed them throughout it was the same story as a year ago in munich , where the blues defeated bayern###munich on penalty###kicks . the chelsea coach that night , roberto###di###matteo , lasted half a season and was paid off . chelsea 's next coach , rafa ben###tez , was crassly labeled interim###coach by abramovich 's men . ben###tez was reviled by the fans , yet he turned a divided team into a winner again . he will , nevertheless , be gone before this month is out , replaced by chelsea 's former coach , jos###mourinho . barely a season has gone by when mourinho has not taunted ben###tez , claiming that the latter follows him around europe , picking up the legacy of teams built by him . this time , the spaniard , ben###tez , can claim that the shoe is on the other foot . for all the criticism thrown at ben###tez , his record in europe is restored , and it is the portuguese , mourinho , who now follows him . and benfica ? it is a team built largely on south###american imports , yet curiously one that suffers from the portuguese custom of so often producing beautiful , flowing and inventive soccer , but without an end###product . we are very sad , artur said wednesday . we showed to the world that benfica is now ready to start winning . no , sir . you and your colleagues###showed plenty of classy movement and intricate build up play . but so much of it was lateral passing , and so often the moves petered out through one short pass too many . and so darned often the ball was stolen from benfica by the hard working lampard or his two midfield accomplices , ramires and david###luiz . both brazilian , and both sold to chelsea by benfica . that is one reality of modern soccer . the lisbon club discovers and imports latin###american talents , but it cannot hold onto the winners among them when predators like chelsea come shopping . abramovich may be a throwback to gianni###agnelli , once the paymaster at juventus . agnelli was probably less impatient , less ruthless in discarding the coaches but he believed that players are important , managers are expendable . or maybe there is another explanation . wednesday was the seventh european final that benfica has contested and lost in more than half a century . the seventh loss since bela guttmann , the team 's hungarian coach , walked out in . guttmann 's benfica had beaten real###madrid to win back to back european###cups , but when he was refused a bonus , he quit . not in a hundred years from now , said guttmann , will benfica win another european###cup . we do n't believe in curses , do we ?
the deep###south was , quite literally , a black and white world in , when congress approved the voting###rights###act , sweeping away barriers that kept african###americans from the polls . and the supreme###court decision on tuesday , which struck down a key part of the law , is certain to set off a series of skirmishes over voting regulations between the white republicans who control southern state###legislatures and civil###rights groups seeking to maximize black voter clout . but those who have studied the region closely say that a more unstoppable force is approaching that will alter the power structure throughout the south and upend the understanding of politics there demographic###change . the states with the highest growth in the latino population over the last decade are in the south , which is also absorbing an influx of people of all races moving in from other parts of the country . while most experts expect battles over voting restrictions in the coming###years , they say that ultimately those efforts cannot hold back the wave of change that will bring about a multiethnic south . all the voter###suppression measures in the world are n't going to be enough to eventually stem this rising###tide , said representative david e . price , a veteran north###carolina democrat and a political###scientist by training . as the region continues to change , republicans who control legislatures in the south will confront a basic question how to retain political###power when the demographics are no longer on your side . the temptation in the short###term , now that the supreme###court has significantly relaxed federal###oversight , may be to pass###laws and gerrymander districts to protect republican political###power and limit the influence of the new more diverse###population . but that could be devastating to the party 's long###term###prospects , especially if it is seen as discriminating against the groups that will make up an ever larger share of the future electorate . the law guaranteeing political###equality for blacks was passed nearly a half###century ago , in the wake of the startling images of violence in selma , ala . the nationally televised coverage shook america 's conscience and marked what president lyndon b . johnson would say in a speech to congress was a moment where history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning###point in man 's unending search for freedom . the act eventually imposed federal###oversight over nine states and other jurisdictions among them , alabama , arizona , georgia , louisiana , mississippi , south###carolina , texas and virginia requiring them to seek preapproval for election laws , like voter###identification measures , redistricting maps and rules related to the mechanics of elections , like polling hours . the supreme###court on tuesday essentially struck down those preapproval requirements , which had deterred states and localities from passing###legislation that they knew would meet with resistance from civil###rights advocates and result in protracted fights . alabama , for example , passed a law in 2011 requiring that voters show photo###identification at the polls . the state put off submitting the legislation to the department of justice , however a delay some democrats attribute to the state 's republicans waiting for the supreme###court decision . but the most meaningful impact of the ruling may be seen in the decade to come , when southern states freed from federal preclearance requirements take up the redrawing of congressional and legislative seats amid much more complex racial###politics than in the days of jim###crow . as the white share of the population shrinks , republican leaders are going to grapple with the same problem their democratic counterparts faced as whites drifted from their ancestral party in the 1980s and 1990s . the south is going to start looking more like california eventually , said arturo vargas , executive###director of the national###association of latino elected and appointed###officials . for years , black and white legislators in the south have agreed to district lines that , thanks to racial packing , create safe###seats for both black democrats and white republicans . the obama administration 's department of justice approved nearly every southern redistricting map , written by republicans , after the 2010 census .

masahiro###tanaka , the pitching ace who went 24 0 in 2013 as he led the tohoku###rakuten###golden###eagles to a japan###series title , will be allowed to sign with a major###league team for the 2014 season , becoming the latest japanese star to be allowed to leave for the united###states before he became a free###agent . the decision to let him go was announced by the team on christmas day in japan , ending weeks of speculation about tanaka 's immediate future and whether rakuten would back away from its initial stance that he should continue pitching in japan until after the 2015 season , when he would become free to go anywhere he wanted . instead , rakuten relented and agreed to accept a 20 million posting fee from the major###league team that prevails in what is expected to a high###priced , free###agent bidding###war among a number of clubs . in the coming###days , tanaka is expected to choose an american agent to represent him in negotiations with major###league teams . the yankees , the los###angeles###dodgers and the boston###red###sox are among the big market , big payroll teams thought to be interested in signing him , with the yankees having the biggest need of those three teams to bolster their starting###rotation . of those three teams , they are the only one that failed to make the postseason in . but any major###league team that wants to bid for tanaka has only to agree to pay rakuten 20 million if they ultimately win out , so there is little to discourage even mid and small###market teams from jumping in and hoping for the best . nevertheless , the winning###bidder is likely to be a team like the yankees that can afford a huge multiyear contract , one that could approach 100 million . as a result , the 25 year old tanaka , who had a . 27 earned###run###average to go with his 24 0 record in , is expected to receive a good deal more money than what the japanese pitchers daisuke###matsuzaka and yu###darvish received when they joined the red###sox and the texas###rangers . matsuzaka got a six year , 52 million contract from the red###sox in december . darvish received a six year , 60 million contract from the rangers that began in . however , both of those pitchers were signed under the old , unrestricted posting system in which only the team with the highest posting bid won the right to negotiate with the player . in each instance , the winning posts exceeded 50 million . that , in turn , limited how much the teams then wanted to pay matsuzaka and darvish . like matsuzaka and darvish , tanaka has a good fastball and an assortment of other pitches . he has been durable , starting 20 or more games in each of his first seven seasons , and has a . 739 winning###percentage . the eagles made clear they wanted tanaka to stay with the team , not just because they would lose their top pitcher so soon after winning their first title but because they would receive far less for him than hoped under the new posting system . the eagles were hoping to generate at least 50 million in compensation , roughly what matsuzaka 's and darvish 's teams received . any team willing to pay the release fee can negotiate with tanaka during a 30 day window . the team that signs tanaka will pay the eagles the fee in installments . there is no penalty for making a bid and then failing to sign the player . in letting him leave , rakuten may have weighed the odds that tanaka will continue his mastery over batters in 2014 and beyond . it is unlikely he will ever have as dominant a season as he did in for one thing , he has thrown many innings the past few years . for instance , in the sixth game of the japan###series this year , he threw 160 pitches and refused to come out of the game . in the clinching seventh###game , he appeared in relief . that sequence alone may give some major###league teams pause as they ponder how much they might be willing to offer tanaka in a free###agent contract . according to sponichi , a japanese sports publication , rakuten may try to form a partnership with whatever team signs tanaka . the yomiuri###giants did that after their slugger hideki###matsui signed with the yankees before the 2003 season . as dominant as tanaka has been during his time with the eagles , whom he joined after finishing high###school , there is no guarantee he will fare as well in the united###states . his fastball is unlikely to overpower major###league batters , who routinely grapple with pitches nearing 100 miles###per###hour . matsuzaka , who is 53 40 in the majors , and darvish , who is 29 18 after two seasons in the united###states , have had to adjust their pitching styles . matsuzaka , in particular , encountered adversity after his first two seasons in boston . japanese pitchers also have to learn how to throw off mounds with balls that are different from those in japan , and deal with umpires with different strike zones . most japanese pitchers also speak limited english , making it difficult to communicate with catchers and coaches . japanese###baseball fans are likely to continue rooting for tanaka in the united###states because they take pride in seeing their stars play overseas . but his departure is likely to stoke fears that japanese professional###baseball , a source of national###pride , is turning into a second class league . they are becoming a feeder system for the m.l.b. , said robert whiting , who has written several books on japanese###baseball . japanese pro baseball has all but disappeared from prime time network television .
salt###lake###city now that tim###duncan is playing well again , the last thing he wants to do is sit . duncan told teammate tony###parker he was very convincing when lobbying san###antonio coach gregg###popovich to keep him in the lineup , even if it was the spurs' fourth###game in five nights and they were facing the team with the worst###record in the western conference . popovich usually rests his 37 year old forward during stretches like this , but duncan rewarded the club with another double###double . he had 22 points and 12 rebounds to lead the spurs to their fourth###straight victory saturday###night , 100 84 over the utah###jazz . sparked by his 23 point , 21 rebound performance against atlanta on dec . 2 , duncan has returned to vintage form after a slow###start to the season . he is averaging 17 points and 13 rebounds over his last six games . the first 20 games , it 's not really that hard to do much better , duncan said . i 'm still not shooting the ball well , but i 'm trying to play hard and find ways to contribute . kawhi###leonard added 13 points to help the spurs ( 19 4 ) coast comfortably past the jazz ( 6 20 ) after a big first half run . we were never worried about timmy . i 've been saying ( it ) since the beginning of the season , said parker , who had 15 points . he 's the last guy we ever need to worry about . but now he 's getting aggressive and he 's getting his shot back . from the beginning , the jazz pressured parker and dared duncan to shoot open elbow jumpers . duncan missed his first three outside shots . he executed well , the shots just did n't go down . but he kept playing like he always does , so it was great , popovich said . trey###burke had 20 points and gordon###hayward scored 18 for the jazz , who shot 39 percent from the field . the jazz were coming off consecutive road wins , including a 103 93 victory friday###night in denver . they had reached 100 points in three of the last four games but were no match for san###antonio 's smothering defense . we did n't###play with the pep we have had the last few games because of the back to back . but i thought the effort was there , just did n't have the same spark , coach tyrone###corbin said . on the other end , the spurs set a series of picks to allow penetration and then passes for open 3 pointers . if that failed , they went to their famously fundamental post player on the block . in just 28 minutes , duncan showed much of his repertoire with bank shots , fallaways , hooks and tip ins . in the post , he 's aggressive and making strong moves , said parker , who was creative in getting duncan the ball where he could gain###confidence . san###antonio played its fourth###consecutive game without the defensive influence of starting###center tiago###splitter , who has a strained calf . the spurs , per 100 possessions , score 14 more points than they give up when splitter is on the floor . but they hardly missed him against the jazz in the first of a four game road trip for the spurs , who are 10 2 away from home . they are a veteran club . they know what to do , when to do it and how to do it . they showed us , corbin said . on nov . 15 in utah , the spurs needed a fourth###quarter rally to wipe away a seven point###deficit and win . parker scored 14 of his 22 points in the fourth###quarter of that one . after a dreadful start when burke was out with a broken finger , the jazz recovered enough to split their last 10 games . the rookie point###guard was hot early and gave parker a taste of his own medicine on a series of floaters and step back jumpers in the first half . more than 6 minutes into the game , the spurs had only six points . but over the remainder of the first half , they used an especially efficient offense to build a 55 40 lead at the break . the reserves , led by marco###belinelli and patty###mills , sparked a 21 6 run to help san###antonio gain###control . our job is to come off the bench and bring that extra gear to turn it up a bit , intensity wise . it starts on defense and if we can capitalize , it translates to good offense , mills said . belinelli and manu ginobili each had 11 points off the san###antonio bench , which contributed 47 points . the spurs outrebounded the jazz 55 42 and outscored utah 50 36 in the paint . they hit the glass really hard and they have a lot of big bodies , so we knew that was going to be a big part of us winning this game . but we had good focus from everybody and when the balls were there to be had , we just went and got them , duncan said . richard###jefferson made a 3 pointer to draw the jazz within double###digits for the only time in the second half at , but duncan scored twice around a 3 pointer by leonard and the spurs were back in control . it was a very good win against a young team that is starting to play better . we respect them and did a good job of playing horn to horn , duncan said . notes utah c rudy gobert and g ian clark were assigned to the club 's d league###affiliate in bakersfield . both earned playing time earlier this season when the jazz were dealing with multiple###injuries . ... belinelli made all three of his 3 point attempts to improve his nba leading mark to . 5 percent . ... jeremy evans matched his career###high with 11 rebounds for utah . . oddly , the jazz had a season high 11 blocks to one for the spurs .
sao###paulo a key brazilian###league soccer game was stopped for more than an hour after fans started###fighting in the stands sunday , prompting police to fire rubber###bullets to contain the crowd and bring a helicopter onto the field to airlift an injured man to a hospital . supporters from atletico paranaense and vasco###da###gama charged against each other and it took several moments for police to take control of the situation in the southern city of joinville . groups of fans punched and kicked each other several times until police arrived and fired rubber###bullets to clear the crowd . doctors said three other fans were hospitalized but none of their injuries were life threatening . the man airlifted from the pitch had a serious head###injury but his life also was n't at risk , according to information released by the hospital sao jose . the match , which restarted after about an hour and 10 minutes , was important for both teams as atletico paranaense was trying to secure a spot in next year 's copa###libertadores and vasco###da###gama , a four time brazilian champion , was hoping to avoid###relegation . atletico paranaense won 5 1 to reach its goal and demote the rio de janeiro club . fan violence has been rampant in brazil this year with several cases of fighting in stadiums across the country , raising###concerns ahead of the world###cup . the match was being played in joinville instead of atletico 's base in curitiba because the club had been punished for fan violence earlier this year . this is deplorable , vasco###da###gama coach adilson batista said . it 's sad to see images like these just before the world###cup in our country . i 'm shocked , this is not sport . television images showed players yelling at the fans and telling them to calm down . some players put their hands on their heads as they watched the fight . a few fans tried to leave the stands to find safety , including a young###woman . a ball girl was shown crying . we tried to tell the fans to stop because things would only get worse . we looked at the stands and there were no cops . there was nobody there to stop the fighting , said atletico paranaense defender luiz alberto , who was shown crying profusely as the altercation was taking###place . i 'm playing for 20 years and i 've never seen anything like this in person . we will have a world###cup in our country and we know these images will be shown everywhere . one atletico paranaense supporter was caught in the middle of several vasco###da###gama fans and was hit several times . tv images showed him motionless on the ground after police arrived to clear the vasco fans . this is very sad , i 've never seen anything like this , atletico paranaense midfielder everton said . one of the fans was alone on the ground and he was being hit for about 10 minutes without anybody doing anything . they would n't###stop hitting him . a vasco supporter also became separated from his group and was attacked by rivals . it 's hard to focus on playing###football after seeing what we saw in the stands , vasco defender chris said . during the hour###long stoppage , atletico paranaense coach vagner mancini said i just feel like going home right now . police were not in the stands when the fighting began behind one of the goals in the stadium . a police official said about 80 private security###guards were on hand to make sure the fan groups remained separated . it 's a private event so the security was being provided by a security company hired by atletico paranaense , officer adilson moreira told###reporters . the referee stopped the match just after 15 minutes , with atletico paranaense leading . after the fighting was over , a police helicopter landed near one of the goals to airlift the most seriously injured fan to a hospital . the referee allowed the match to restart when more police###officers were called in . they replaced the security###guards separating the fan sections in the stands . vasco directors did not want the match to continue , saying they feared for their players' safety . no altercations were reported after the match ended .
houston if there is one thing that joe###girardi has developed a knack for , it is how to phase out franchise stars , whether it was the awkward and turbulent last year of jorge###posada or the smooth goodbyes the past few days for mariano###rivera and andy###pettitte . as the yankees look to 2014 and a transitional###period , girardi 's experience in that sticky realm could be invaluable . provided he returns to the yankees his current contract runs out nov . 1 girardi may oversee many changes on the team , but none more delicate than the gradual , or perhaps abrupt , departure of derek###jeter . jeter will turn 40 next june and is coming off the most disappointing###season of his career , one which he has labeled a nightmare , as injuries###limited him to 17 games . but as recently as , he led the major###leagues with 216 hits . jeter , whose injury problems began with a broken left ankle last october , has said he will be back next year after having a full off season to do his normal conditioning###program . he had little more to say after sunday 's regular###season###finale , a 5 1 victory in 14 innings against the houston###astros . our season just ended , so i have n't had any thoughts at all about next season , jeter said . there is no debate about jeter 's drive to compete and play , or that he expects to return to the level of play to which he is accustomed , and girardi said he felt the same way . i expect him to play and i expect him to do everything in his power to get back to the form that he had in , girardi said . he has a lot of strength that he wants to gain back in his legs and have a normal off season , and it should be good for him . but if he cannot do that , and if girardi is still in charge , it would fall primarily to him to facilitate what could be a difficult###transition to the post jeter era . it could be difficult , girardi said . only time will tell how tricky that situation becomes . we all know he wants to be out there every day . and that 's what i love about him , i do . but it does n't make it any easier . girardi has learned much about how to deal with the end of a star 's career , beginning with that rocky period when he had to phase out posada at catcher and then out of the lineup altogether . conversely , rivera played at an elite###level to his very last pitch thursday###night . but even pettitte , whose complete###game victory saturday in houston , his hometown , provided the perfect ending to his 18 year career , had to have his innings and pitch counts cut back as a concession to his 41 years . even in the unlikely event that girardi does not return to manage the yankees , his successor can learn from girardi 's experiences in this challenging realm . mo 's been the easiest because i never had to change the way i used him , girardi said . but andy had to cut back on his pitches a little bit when he wanted to be out there longer . it 's somewhat difficult because the thing that has made all these guys great is their competitiveness . their heart tells them that they can throw 130 pitches , that they can catch 140 games . but you know that it 's physically not possible . so in a sense , you almost feel like you 're protecting them against themselves , which is difficult because you know they want to be out there all the time . but if you are going to keep them productive through the course of a long season , you could have to protect them , and that 's not always what they want to hear . and so what has he learned from it all ? you learn how difficult it 's going to be , he said . it 's sensitive because they are competitive . it 's what makes them who they are . it 's a will to find a way to overcome anything that 's in your way , whether it 's a bad shoulder or a bad back or cranky elbow whatever it is , they are used to finding a way , and that 's what made them great . it is a stubbornness that is so essential to those players' becoming first professionals and later stars . but it is also what can make their farewells hard to watch unless they go out in a manner like rivera or pettitte . and of course , jeter has always had a flair for the dramatic ( remember the home###run for his , 000th hit ? ) , so his farewell could easily elicit the same magic as rivera 's or pettitte 's . girardi will have many other issues with which to contend if he returns . robinson cano , the yankees' best player , is a free###agent . alex###rodriguez is facing a possible 211 game suspension . hiroki###kuroda and curtis###granderson may be gone , and c . c . sabathia may be on the decline after a career workload in which he has thrown , 7751 3 innings , making it a challenge for the yankees to field a competitive team in . i 've never been afraid of any challenge , girardi said . whether he does come back will depend on his family , he said . his name has been linked with the chicago###cubs . girardi grew up in chicago as a cubs fan and came up through their organization as a player . but he said he did not have the same ties to chicago he once did , and that his family , including three school###age###children , has enjoyed living in westchester###county the past seven years . he said his decision would be based on a meeting with his wife and children , and then general###manager brian###cashman making it sound as if the choice is between managing the yankees and taking some time off . it 's not so much the circumstances , but what 's best for my crew , he said . girardi could help the yankees' transition with his knowledge of the organization and his familiarity with many of their minor###league players , who were forced into action at the major###league level this year because of all the team 's injuries . knowing all the intricacies of the yankees' system , their management style and expectations is a valuable###commodity for a manager . i 've always said , that 's the most difficult###thing when you take a job , is coming in and trying to figure out what you have , he said . you think you know a player from afar , but you do n't really know him until you get in there with him . girardi has been there with all the so called core four players rivera , pettitte , posada and jeter on and off since they were first teammates in . he has seen three of them off in sometimes painful , sometimes beautiful and always emotional ways that were often hard for the fans to take . if girardi is around for the last one , it might be the hardest of them all .
thirty five years after her husband 's final###game for the boston###red###sox , a brilliant two hit###shutout that set up a one game playoff against the yankees , maria tiant remains a fervent red###sox fan . she watches most games at her home in fort###myers , fla . , sometimes wearing a red###sox shirt or a lucky hat , cheering , yelling , jumping straight up out of her seat as she nervously follows her team , especially now that it is fighting for a third championship since her husband , luis , retired . oh , my , i want them to win so much , she said . i am always yelling at the tv 'why ca n't you hit the ball ? please , hit the ball . ' i get upset because i know they can do it . but i still love them all . many former players cherish their old teams and support them zealously . others left their clubs under bad circumstances and harbor resentments . some are merely indifferent to the fates of their former teams . but what compels a woman to remain###loyal to the team that her husband has n't pitched for since jimmy###carter was president ? i do n't know if other wives still root for the red###sox or not , she said in a telephone interview . maybe a lot of the wives are n't still together with the players . maybe they are n't as interested . for me , i am just a big fan . in part , maria tiant roots for the red###sox because luis###tiant still works for them . for the past decade he has been an instructor and an ambassador of sorts for the red###sox . he also owns a sausage stand outside fenway###park . but it 's more than that . born and raised in mexico###city , maria tiant came to love the red###sox while luis played for them from 1971 through , years that included some indelible memories , including tiant 's five hit###shutout in game 1 of the 1975 world###series at fenway###park against the cincinnati###reds . tiant , now , also singled and scored a run in that game , missing home###plate before sneaking back to touch it with his toe amid chants of looo ee , looo ee . i was sitting in the stands with my red###sox noisemaker , maria tiant recalled . i will never forget when he went back to touch the plate . and his father was able to come from cuba and throw out the first pitch , too . that was the first time i met him . i loved that man . luis met maria when he was playing in mexico in . or , more accurately , when maria was playing . then maria navarro , she played###softball for her employer , the instituto###mexicano del seguro social , in mexico###city . during one game , as she was running in from center###field , a handsome###young###man in the stands blew her a kiss . her friends said , did you see that ? she just blushed and said , oh , he 's crazy . luis was at the game with a friend , who was also friends with two sisters on maria 's team . a few days later , in july , the sisters hosted a party and invited luis and maria . they met formally for the first time , talked and danced , and began###dating soon after . on oct . 1 of that year in her 70s , maria has remarkable recall for dates luis went back to cuba , which was in the early###stages of fidel###castro 's regime . but during their first months together , she said , he never told her he was a pitcher for the tigers in the mexican###league . over the winter , he wrote###letters from cuba , and they spoke on the phone a few times . he returned to mexico on may , 1961 , on one of the last flights to mexico###city allowed to leave cuba . on aug . 12 , some time after he revealed that he was a professional player , they were married , a union forged through baseball . in , luis moved to the united###states to pitch in the cleveland###indians' system . maria remained in mexico###city during his first 12 major###league###seasons , and their children , two boys and a girl , were born there . in , the family moved to milton , mass . , just south of boston , during the height of luis 's success with the red###sox . daniel , the tiants' youngest###child , is 39 and runs tiant cigar . the company was founded by luis , whose love of cigars has been well known since his pitching days , when he was nicknamed###el tiante . daniel also spends time watching the red###sox with his mother , and trying not to get in her way . she 's really into it , and she really knows the game , daniel said by telephone . when my dad pitched , it was about supporting him . now , it 's just about rooting for her red###sox , and she is zeroed in on it . sometimes i just have to get out of there because it 's pretty intense . when luis pitched for the indians , maria rooted for them . when luis left boston to join the yankees , she cheered for them , as well , and also for the pirates and angels , luis 's last two teams . ( he pitched 19 years for six major###league teams , and many say he deserves to be in the hall of fame . ) but there was always something special about the red###sox . maria , who still goes to games in boston , said her favorite###player was david###ortiz of course . when the team 's owners asked luis to work for the red###sox , maria said , it was like going home . i was so happy , she said . i always like to think of my husband with the red###sox .
washington when the veteran senator max###baucus announced his retirement in april , a feeling of dread went through the democratic ranks , not so much over the potential loss of his montana seat , but over the game of musical committee###chairs that would elevate an iconoclast to lead the coveted finance committee and a pro oil moderate to head the energy committee . but as politics begin supplanting policy###considerations ahead of the 2014 elections , calculations are shifting on capitol###hill . it is a measure of the challenging political landscape democrats face that mr . baucus 's pending nomination to be ambassador to china has been greeted with glee by his fellow senate democrats . now they are happy to hand the finance committee gavel to senator ron###wyden , the mercurial oregonian who currently leads the energy and natural###resources###committee , because it puts senator mary l . landrieu of louisiana , one of the most endangered democrats up for re election in , at the energy helm a position that will help her campaign rake in cash from industry and press her pro oil politics in her fossil fueled state . moreover , the democratic governor of montana , steve bullock , can appoint mr . baucus 's successor , potentially sending his lieutenant governor , john###walsh , to the senate to run next year with the power of incumbency . that could increase the democrats' chances of retaining that seat one seen as crucial to republicans' efforts to win back the senate . democrats were once confident that their five seat###majority was large enough to withstand the midterm###elections . but with democratic###incumbents vacating three seats in montana , west###virginia and south###dakota that either lean republican or are rated a likely republican win , the outcome is less than certain . in addition , the re election in arkansas of senator mark###pryor , a democrat , is considered a tossup . even states that democrats had expected to hold could turn out to be more competitive . on thursday , the nonpartisan cook###political###report moved the contest for the michigan seat of senator carl###levin another retiring democrat from leaning democratic to a race that could go either way . and former senator scott p . brown , a republican from massachusetts , said he would be moving to new hampshire and registering###to###vote there , fueling speculation that he is preparing to challenge senator jeanne###shaheen 's re election bid . jennifer duffy , a senate analyst at the cook###political###report , gave republicans a 25 percent to 30 percent chance of retaking the senate next november , up from 20 percent earlier this fall . i feel like i 'm looking at a different landscape today than i was sept . 30 , she said . am i predicting the republicans take the senate ? no , she said , while adding that the trajectory is better today than it was 60 days###ago . mr . baucus 's pending nomination is the first break democrats have gotten in some time . brad dayspring , spokesman for the national###republican###senatorial###committee , called it blatant manipulation and a big###sky buy off , laying the nomination at the feet of senator harry###reid of nevada , the majority###leader , whom mr . dayspring called brigadier###general of the back room deal . democratic officials familiar with the decision say it came after weeks of discussions between mr . baucus and vice###president joseph r . biden jr . , a longtime###friend . politics were a consideration , they say , but only one . mr . baucus wanted the ambassadorship and pitched his interest in trade and his experience with chinese industries from his perch on the finance committee . the senator would not comment on the nomination , which is not official . there is a time and place for everything . it 's in scriptures , he said . now is not the time . now is not the place . and democratic leaders insisted they never had any qualms about mr . wyden taking over the finance committee or ms . landrieu heading the energy and natural###resources###committee . we go on committees by seniority , and there 's a consensus in the senate democratic caucus to stick by that , said senator charles e . schumer of new york , the third ranking###democrat . a chair still has to get a majority in his or her committee , so we have confidence in that . ms . landrieu had already been campaigning in louisiana as the next energy chairwoman , but she has been more circumspect in washington . i would be honored to be chair of the energy committee . i am very patient right now because there are many moving###parts , she said . there 's one chair of that committee . he 's ron###wyden . there 's one chair of finance , max###baucus , and we 'll just have to see how this works . democrats said thursday they saw no downside to the shifting seats in washington . ms . landrieu is not likely to move controversial legislation in an election year , like opening more federal###lands and waters to oil###drilling . with mr . baucus gone , his quixotic and politically divisive push for a sweeping overhaul of the tax###code will most likely go with him . and if mr . walsh claims the montana seat , he can raise his profile and bolster his campaign war###chest . with less than a year in washington , opponents will be hard###pressed to label him an insider , democratic campaign officials said , especially since his opponent , representative steve###daines , is montana 's republican congressman . republicans are not so sure . mr . dayspring said democrats will destroy mr . walsh 's main claim to office if they bring him to washington to run as an outsider , and ms . landrieu had long claimed the mantle of the energy committee , even if the gavel was n't hers . obviously they perceive it 's good because they 're the ones that engineered the deal , he said . but , he added , it 's hard to see how this helps them .
there are more charismatic stars in the n.c.a.a . tournament , more compelling###characters , louder and flashier . there are players who jump on scorers' tables , and players who preen after dunks . shane###larkin of miami does none of that . he treats basketball like a chemistry exam , and he gets consistently###high grades . a sophomore point###guard , larkin has been the steadying force for the hurricanes this season . with larkin operating as coach jim larranaga 's on court surrogate , miami claimed its first atlantic###coast###conference regular###season###and###tournament###titles . larranaga described him as a player with an innate feel for the game . all those so called intangibles ? larkin has them . shane was the missing piece of the puzzle for us , larranaga said . as the no . 2 seed in the east region , the hurricanes suddenly find themselves in unfamiliar###territory , as a tournament heavyweight . only once , in , has miami advanced###past the round of . the hurricanes' profile has grown . it does not seem to be particularly daunting for them . we 're a very hungry team , said larkin , who scored 28 points in sunday 's a.c.c . championship game , an 87 77 victory over north###carolina . we want more and more . larranaga first saw larkin play when he was a high###school###sophomore . larranaga , the coach at george###mason at the time , offered him a scholarship on the spot . larkin wound up committing to depaul , but when larranaga left for miami before the start of last season , larkin followed him . their partnership has been a fruitful one , even if took time for larkin to find his voice . last season , as a freshman , larkin was more passenger than conductor . he hung back and let older teammates run the show . miami went , settling for a bid to the national###invitation###tournament . he had some great###moments , the assistant###coach chris caputo said , but i 'm not sure he ever really opened up completely until the end of the year . larkin can come off as reserved , almost guarded a result , caputo said , of being the son of a famous###athlete . his father , barry###larkin , is the hall of fame shortstop . growing up , shane###larkin never sought attention , never wanted the spotlight , because it was always around , reflecting off his father . he can be a little introverted , caputo said . once he gets more comfortable around you , his personality comes through . this season , larkin has looked at ease , having formed a potent starting backcourt with the senior durand scott . in saturday 's a.c.c . semifinal win over north###carolina###state , the two combined for 55 points and 8 assists . they like that challenge of proving themselves every single night , larranaga said . they 're both so competitive . when we do drills back home , if we do n't keep score , they 're bored . no . 2 for miami is first for a.c.c . no . 2 miami is the first team to sweep the atlantic###coast###conference regular###season###and###tournament###titles and not receive a no . 1 seed . instead , indiana , which is coming off a loss to wisconsin in the big###ten###tournament semifinals , is the top seed . the hoosiers are led by the lightning quick guard victor###oladipo , a matchup nightmare . no . 3 marquette and no . 8 north###carolina###state are dangerous teams . a revived orange a couple of weeks###ago , syracuse was considered an also ran . coach jim###boeheim said he was ready to go golfing . things have changed after a spirited run to the big###east title game . if point###guard michael###carter###williams can take care of the ball and james southerland can maintain his 3 point touch , the orange could be tough . upset special no . 12 california basically gets a home###game against no . 5 nevada###las###vegas in san###jose , a huge benefit . the runnin' rebels edged cal , 76 75 , in december .
manchester united 's seven point lead over its neighbor manchester###city stayed intact after the title chasing rivals downed two of the premier###league 's fallen giants in contrasting ways on sunday . while united scraped out a nervy 2 1 win over visiting liverpool , city cruised to a 2 0 victory at arsenal after playing against 10 men for most of the match . laurent###koscielny 's ninth minute red card for wrestling edin dzeko to the ground inside the area proved###decisive for city , even though dzeko missing the resulting###penalty . dzeko later tapped in a rebound to supplement an opening###goal by james###milner . the only negative for city after its first league win at arsenal in 38 years was the red card awarded to its captain , vincent###kompany . he faces a three game suspension after he was sent off for a two footed tackle . robin###van###persie started united on the way to victory over liverpool at old trafford with his league leading 17th goal of the season . nemanja vidic unwittingly made it 2 0 when patrice###evra 's header went in off the back of his head , but united had to resort to some desperate defending to preserve the lead after the substitute daniel###sturridge scored for liverpool . the name of the game is winning , united###manager###alex###ferguson said . there are moments where you have to defend . today was one of them . arsenal###manager###ars###ne###wenger , who saw his team drop to sixth###place , said the growing###pressure to perform from the crowd at the emirates###stadium was showing up in his team 's play . arsenal has won only 4 of its 11 home###matches in the league , and the pressure from fans to win something after a seven year trophy drought is growing . we are a bit too nervous to play in a serene way at home , and that shows in the way we start the games , wenger said , adding , i feel we wanted to do so well , but we are a bit uptight . many pundits had predicted that this weekend would be a pivotal###moment in the title race , but united 's lead is unchanged with 16 matches still to play . chelsea , a###4 0 winner at stoke on saturday , can keep alive its hopes of catching the manchester clubs by beating southampton on wednesday , but it would still trail united by 11 points . messi leads barcelona in his first game since winning an unprecedented fourth ballon###d'or as world player of the year , lionel###messi scored one goal and set up two more to steer barcelona to a 3 1 win at m laga . barcelona ( 18 0 1 ) improved to 10 0 away from home this season and maintained its 11 point lead over atl###tico###madrid , which beat real###zaragoza , 2 0 . real###madrid is a distant third , 18 points back .
fort###meade , md . military prosecutors preparing to try pfc . bradley manning said on wednesday that they would introduce evidence that osama###bin###laden requested and received from a qaeda member some of the state###department cables and military reports that private manning is accused of passing to wikileaks . the prosecutors also said they would present logs of internet chats in february 2010 between private manning and julian###assange , the founder of wikileaks , including one in which the two men appeared to be laughing together about a new york times article . the march , 2010 , article said that the pentagon had listed wikileaks as a threat to military###operations and security . the military judge hearing the case , col . denise lind , said private manning 's trial would be postponed until at least june 3 to allow consideration of classified###information that may be used . the trial is expected to take roughly six weeks . private manning , 25 , formerly a low###level intelligence###analyst in iraq , could face a sentence of life without parole if convicted on all charges , including aiding the enemy . he is accused of the largest unauthorized###disclosure of confidential documents in history , including , 000 diplomatic###cables , field###reports from the wars in afghanistan and iraq , video footage of an american helicopter gunship killing two reuters journalists in iraq and government assessments of the detainees at guant###namo###bay , cuba . in a bid for a lower sentence , private manning 's lawyers have said he would admit that he supplied the documents to wikileaks and committed certain lesser crimes . the judge had previously said some , but not all , of the offers were acceptable under military law . on wednesday , defense lawyers adjusted their offer , saying private manning would be willing to admit to a list of crimes with a total maximum###sentence of 20 years . if the judge finds the plea legal , prosecutors will have the option of going along with it or proceeding with a trial in an attempt to convict him on some or all of the most serious charges . the defense has said its witnesses would argue that the material private manning gave wikileaks was relatively low###grade and outdated information that could not do significant###damage to national###security . the prosecutors' challenge to one proposed defense###witnesses , yochai###benkler , a harvard###law professor and internet expert , led to a revealing discussion about the nature of wikileaks . colonel lind , the judge , asked a prosecutor a hypothetical question if private manning had given the documents to the new york times rather than to wikileaks , would he face the same charges ? the new york times and other mainstream###publications published hundreds of the documents private manning is accused of leaking . the justice###department is carrying out an investigation of wikileaks to determine whether mr . assange or his associates can be charged with a crime . media advocates say such a prosecution would be a dangerous precedent for news organizations like the times that frequently obtain and publish information the government considers classified .
east###rutherford , n.j . leaving the practice###field monday###morning , giants coach tom###coughlin was asked about the limited number of running###backs he had available during the workout . what do you mean ? coughlin asked . we had one . we 're all set . the remaining healthy giants running back is the rookie michael cox , a seventh###round###draft###pick who was a junior###hockey star growing up in boston and did not play organized###football until he was . it was a little strange being the only one out there for practice , cox said monday . but i feel like i 'm ready to go . they said i 'm going to be playing . if he can stay###healthy until then , cox is a near certainty to get the ball when the giants play the minnesota###vikings on monday because so many other giants running###backs are injured . the starting running back david wilson is out with a neck###injury , which will not need surgery , but is likely to keep him out the next three weeks . andre brown , who was supposed to share the rushing duties with wilson , is not scheduled to return from his broken###leg until nov . 10 . da'rel scott , waived oct . 1 and re signed a week later , has a severe hamstring strain that will not be healed for weeks . and brandon###jacobs , the new starter , did not practice on monday , resting a hamstring strain he sustained during his 22 carries in the giants' loss to the bears . coughlin said jacobs would probably return to practice thursday the giants are off tuesday and wednesday and called his absence precautionary . as for cox , a 24 year old drafted out of massachusetts , coughlin said he had a good practice . but he also expressed the usual reservations about playing a rookie running back . he 's young , coughlin said . it 's sophisticated , and there are some complex things being thrown at him , particularly in the protection area , so you 've got to be careful . he obviously has a lot going , and there are some things right now we feel good about . cox , 6 feet , 220 pounds , had a strong preseason , impressing the giants with his speed and his elusiveness . but making quick decisions against regular###season defenses that are more multifaceted than a rookie sees in the preseason will be a challenge for cox . there 's a lot to understand , cox said . you have to read the defensive fronts , linebackers and secondary almost like a quarterback . but i feel like i 'm ready to go . cox does not have the typical background of a n.f.l . running back . as a youth hockey star , he played at the junior###level , a step below professional hockey . but when it came time to dedicate himself to hockey year round , he enrolled in avon old farms , a connecticut boarding###school where he played his first football game and developed into a top college prospect . cox played three years at michigan , where he never won a starting###job , then played the 2012 season at massachusetts , a program that on saturday gained its second victory in the last two years . but the giants discovered cox in the weeks before this year 's n.f.l . draft and made him their final###selection , which was the second to last pick of the draft . nicks brushes off trade talk wide###receiver hakeem###nicks said he had heard of a news report that n.f.l . teams were planning to contact the giants to see if they were willing to trade him , but nicks did not seem worried about leaving the giants . i 'm not buying into it , nicks said . i 'm sure they got enough respect for me to come and talk to me about a situation like that . it would be common for a general###manager of an 0 6 team like the giants to field inquiries about their most valuable###assets , especially a player like nicks , who can be a free###agent at the end of the season . keeping nicks next season will cost the giants at least 10 million a year in salary . at the same time , because he can be a free###agent , any team that acquires him would be essentially renting nicks for the remainder of the season . for that reason , he probably would not command a big return in a trade . other than acquiring linebacker jon beason for a late round###pick last week , the giants have not made an in season trade since . the trade###deadline is oct . 29 . i 'm a giant , and i love playing for the giants , nicks said . i 'm more focused on what we 're doing as a team right now to get this thing turned around .
norman , okla . nicole kornet scored a career###high 26 points , topping her previous best of , as no . 20 oklahoma cruised past maryland###eastern###shore 105 46 sunday . after a week off , oklahoma built an early 36 10 lead before going on a 14 0 run , with scoring from five different sooners and eventually###led 54 15 at halftime . kaylon williams had 14 points for oklahoma ( 7 3 ) and gioya carter added 11 points , nine coming from the free###throw line . nicole griffin controlled the paint with nine points , ten rebounds and four blocked###shots , helping the sooners finish with a 59 37 rebounding advantage . the oklahoma defense held maryland###eastern###shore ( 3 6 ) to . 7 percent###shooting , forced 21 turnovers and had seven blocks . alexis udoji scored 13 points for umes . jessica###long , averaging . 8 points coming in , was held to just six points on 2 of 8 shooting . shawnee sweeney made just one of her 12 shots from behind the arc .
washington four days before taking the oath of office , president###obama on wednesday staked the beginning of his second term on an uphill quest to pass the broadest gun###control legislation in a generation . in the aftermath of the connecticut school massacre , mr . obama vowed to rally public###opinion to press a reluctant congress to ban military style assault###weapons and high###capacity###magazines , expand background###checks , and toughen gun trafficking laws . recognizing that the legislative fight could be long and difficult , the president also took immediate steps by issuing a series of executive###actions intended to reduce gun###violence . surrounded by children who wrote him letters seeking curbs on guns , mr . obama committed himself to a high###profile and politically volatile campaign behind proposals assembled by vice###president joseph r . biden jr . that will test the administration 's strength heading into the next four years . the first big###push of mr . obama 's second term , then , will come on an issue that was not even on his to do list on election day when voters renewed his lease on the presidency . i will put everything i 've got into this , mr . obama said , and so will joe . the emotionally charged ceremony , attended by family members of those killed at sandy###hook elementary###school in newtown , conn . , reflected a decision by the white###house to seize on public###outrage to challenge the political###power of the national###rifle###association and other forces that have successfully###fought new gun###laws for decades . the white###house is planning a multifaceted effort to sell its plans , including speeches around the country by the president and vice###president and concerted lobbying by interest groups to influence several dozen lawmakers from both parties seen as critical to passage . the white###house created a web###page with video testimonials from victims of gun###violence and a sign up for supporters to help advocate the president 's plan . i tell you , the only way we can change is if the american people demand it , mr . obama said . and , by the way , that does n't just mean from certain parts of the country . we 're going to need voices in those areas , in those congressional###districts where the tradition of gun###ownership is strong , to speak up and to say this is important . it ca n't just be the usual###suspects . the n.r.a . made clear that it was ready for a fight . even before the president 's speech , it broadcast a provocative video calling mr . obama an elitist hypocrite for opposing more armed###guards in schools while his daughters had secret###service protection . after the speech the group said it would work to secure schools , fix the mental###health system and prosecute criminals but criticized the president 's other proposals . attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation , the n.r.a . said in a statement . only honest , law###abiding gun###owners will be affected , and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy . mr . obama 's plan included 4 major legislative proposals and 23 executive###actions that he initiated on his own authority to bolster enforcement of existing###laws , improve the nation 's database used for background###checks and otherwise make it harder for criminals and people with mental###illness to get guns . mr . obama asked congress to reinstate and strengthen a ban on the sale and production of assault###weapons that passed in 1994 and expired in . he also called for a ban on the sale and production of magazines with more than 10 rounds , like those used in newtown and other mass###shootings . mr . obama 's plan would require criminal###background###checks for all gun sales , closing the longstanding loophole that allows buyers to avoid screening by purchasing weapons from unlicensed sellers at gun shows or in private sales . nearly 40 percent of all gun sales are exempt from the system . he also proposed###legislation banning the possession or transfer of armor###piercing bullets and cracking down on straw purchasers , those who pass background###checks and then forward guns to criminals or others forbidden from purchasing them . for mr . obama , the plan represented a political pivot . while he has always expressed###support for an assault###weapons###ban , he has made no real effort to pass it on the assumption that the votes were not there . but he and the white###house are banking on the idea that the newtown shooting has changed the dynamics . i have never seen the nation 's conscience so shaken by what happened at sandy###hook , mr . biden said wednesday . the world has changed and is demanding action .
the court appointed mediator who brokered a proposed 765 million deal between the nfl and , 500 former players characterized it as a win###win . so did the league and the players' lead attorney . but not everyone with skin in the game was convinced . at least one player suggested it was hush###money well spent . i 'm used to the nfl taking a hard###line approach as they have throughout the years with strikes and everything else , said former pro###bowl lineman lomas###brown , a plaintiff in the concussion related lawsuits . i 'm curious how they came up with the figure and i 've got a lot of questions , but i am happy that it 's done . yet brown could n't help adding , any time the nfl acknowledges they are ready to settle something , it shows they knew they had some sort of negligence . the nature of compromise is such that neither side gets everything they want . and the benefits proposed for former players are both considerable and desperately###needed . it wo n't restore lives already lost or ruined , nor heal broken minds and spirits the toll the game extracted from some has been terrible and irreversible . but it would provide help right away to generations of past players still suffering the effects of concussion related###injuries . it would also replace the uncertain outcome and cost of litigation with a step###by###step process overseen by independent doctors to assess the extent of those injuries and then cover the medical bills . there 's no way to minimize how important that is to those near the breaking###point or beyond , and the families struggling to look after them . i am able to live my life the same way i was , but now chances are i am 44 now , i wo n't make it to 50 or 60 i have money now to put back for my children to go to college and for a little something to be there financially , said former nfl running back kevin turner , who suffers from lou###gehrig 's disease and was also a party to the lawsuit . it will give them the peace of mind to have the best quality of life they can have , turner added , referring to other former players . no longer have to make decisions regarding their health based on what they can afford , but based on what is the best treatment for them . and as mediator layn phillips , a retired judge appointed by the u.s . district court in philadelphia , noted in a statement released after the proposed deal was announced , the alternative was for the two sides to spend the next 10 years and millions###of###dollars on litigation , which would have been great for lawyers , expert###witnesses , trial consultants and others . but it would not do much for retired players and their families who are in need . yet it was phillips' next sentence that may ultimately###decide how good a deal this turns out to be this resolution allows the sides to join together , do something constructive , and build a better game for the future . like the players , the nfl will reap some important benefits . for one thing , the league can deny any wrongdoing and likely wo n't have to answer a welter of potentially###damaging questions for example , how a rheumatologist ended up in charge of its euphemistically named mild traumatic###brain###injury committee for more than a decade . the deal also ends the spectre of commissioner roger###goodell and his league just ahead of this season 's kickoff , no less callously battling in court the very players who made pro###football wildly popular and profitable . and it finally puts real money where the nfl 's mouth has been for years . commissioner goodell and every owner gave the legal###team the same direction do the right thing for the game and for the men who played it , league vice###president jeff pash said . this is an important###step that builds on the significant changes we 've made in recent###years to make the game safer , and we will continue our work to better the long###term health and well being of nfl players . save the second half of that quote , and look at it again at the end of this season , and for a few seasons after that . because the 765 million , even if the league paid it now in a lump###sum . represents less than 10 percent of the 9 billion plus the nfl currently collects in revenues . assuming the league grows only modestly year after year , by the time the settlement fund is closed sometime around , the payout will be less than 1 percent . until the settlement was proposed , it was impossible to have a candid discussion of how safe playing in the nfl can be . the league 's insurers and lawyers made sure of that , at least as long as the lawsuit was hanging over their heads . on top of that , the collective###bargaining###agreement between the nfl and its players effectively heads off similar lawsuits in the future . by capping the league 's liability for the damages that concussions caused in the past , it frees the nfl to become a real partner in player safety issues unhindered by any conflicts of interest . that was exactly what phillips had in mind when the mediator called it a win###win . the settlement means that the parties reached an agreement to put litigation behind them , get help to retired players who need it , and work proactively to support research and make the game safer . these , phillips wrote , are goals everyone can share . jim

real###madrid and jos###mourinho , its portuguese coach , were sifting through the debris of what mourinho termed a disastrous 2012 13 season after friday 's king 's cup###final defeat left the world 's richest club without a major trophy this season . the 2 1 lost to atl###tico###madrid at real 's bernab u stadium meant that mourinho , widely###expected to move on at the end of this season , finished without a title for the first time in his otherwise glittering career . it represents a huge setback for the self appointed special one , as well as for the real president , florentino p rez , who lured mourinho from inter###milan at great###expense in 2010 and has constantly referred to him as the world 's best coach . obsessed with winning a 10th european crown that has eluded real since , p rez has spent more than 513 million on players since returning to lead the club in , including a record 94 million on cristiano###ronaldo . that investment has so far yielded one king 's cup in 2011 in mourinho 's first season and a la###liga title last season with a record haul of 100 points . the nine time champions of europe have lost in the semifinals of the champions###league in each of mourinho 's three seasons , and they surrendered their la###liga title to barcelona last weekend , a fourth for their archrivals in five years . friday 's extra time defeat against atl###tico was made more painful and damaging for the club 's image by the dismissal of mourinho from the bench for protesting a decision by the referee and a red card for ronaldo for kicking the face of the atl###tico captain , gabi . mourinho , who has done little to quash speculation he is on his way back to chelsea of england 's premier###league , spent a large part of his postmatch news conference defending his record at real while claiming that atl###tico had not deserved to win the match . what for many would be a good season is my worst , he said . we have been close , but that does not exist in football . always outspoken , mourinho has alienated some real fans in recent###months with his treatment of the club captain and goalkeeper iker###casillas , who has been benched since returning from a broken hand . dressing###room divisions burst into the open in the last few weeks , with mourinho 's portuguese compatriot pepe drawing the coach 's wrath after a public defense of casillas . pepe , a central defender , was left out of the squad friday , while mourinho again selected goalkeeper diego###l###pez . mourinho , who has a contract until june , said he would sit down with p rez after real 's final two league matches to decide whether he will continue . atl###tico 's fans gleefully mocked their real counterparts at the bernab u on friday with chants of mourinho stay ! mourinho stay ! but a change of coach may now be inevitable after the events of recent weeks . schalke in champions###league schalke clinched the league 's last champions###league place by beating freiburg , 2 1 , on the final day of games in germany 's bundesliga on saturday . fortuna###d###sseldorf was relegated , but hoffenheim escaped automatic demotion by winning , 2 1 , at borussia###dortmund . d sseldorf lost , 3 0 , at hannover , and augsburg took advantage by beating the bottom dweller greuther###f###rth , 3 1 , to stay in the top flight . eintracht###frankfurt drew , 2 2 , with wolfsburg to earn a europa###league spot , and champion bayern###munich won , 4 3 , at borussia###m###nchengladbach .

when mark###teixeira squeezed the final out of the yankees ' last championship , in , he bolted across the diamond from first base . teixeira would say later he had no plan for the celebration he just took off , a spontaneous expression of joy . he was not trying to run toward alex###rodriguez . somehow , though , it made perfect###sense that he did . from the moment he was welcomed into professional###baseball , 20 years###ago this week as the first overall pick in the amateur draft , rodriguez has exerted a magnetic pull like no other player . as rodriguez has said , in so many words , it always comes back to him . rodriguez is a ghostly presence around these yankees , spending spring###training and almost all of the regular###season away from the team , recovering from another hip operation . his teammates had to answer for him wednesday anyway , because rodriguez was big###news again . rodriguez has been linked to a shuttered florida anti###aging clinic whose owner , anthony bosch , has agreed###to###cooperate with major###league###baseball 's investigators . the league could pursue suspensions for bosch 's clients , and while other stars , like ryan###braun of the milwaukee###brewers , may also be vulnerable , no one shines like rodriguez . to the yankees , his glow is more like an overhead fluorescent###light , constantly buzzing and lasting forever . if baseball can prove that rodriguez did , indeed , have another dalliance with banned###substances , he may not have much support in the clubhouse . the yankees rallied behind rodriguez in , when he admitted to using banned drugs before baseball began###testing with penalties . the landscape has changed now , and tuesday 's revelation , by espn , that more than 20 players could face 100 game suspensions is a deeper stain on the game . i think it 's embarrassing , teixeira said , speaking generally about the report . this is all speculation , but if it is true , then i do n't think it 's good for the game . we 're supposed to be good examples for kids , for fans . it 'd be one thing if we did n't have a policy . we 've had a very tough policy for a long time . if that many guys are still cheating , it 's just very disappointing . teixeira was the yankees' best player in , but rodriguez was their most indelible , especially when it mattered most . a postseason failure before and since for the yankees , rodriguez owned that fall , hitting . 365 with 6 homers and 18 runs batted in . the championship was rodriguez 's gift to the yankees , the contribution that makes it impossible to dismiss the 10 year , 275 million contract that runs through . yes , the yankees should have let rodriguez leave and traded , say , austin###jackson and joba###chamberlain to the marlins for miguel###cabrera . but they cannot go back . at least they could save millions if rodriguez ever does serve a 100 game ban . the notion of voiding the remaining contract , because of performance enhancers , still seems far fetched jason giambi was in town this week with the cleveland###indians , as if to underscore the point . giambi did not make himself available wednesday to lend perspective on the latest drug maelstrom . his manager , terry###francona , said it best anyway . as an industry , we buried our heads in the sand a little bit , and now we 're paying the price for it , francona said . i certainly think what we have in place right now is very good . we 're trying very hard to make our game as good as it can be . the yankees who spoke after wednesday 's victory offered support for rodriguez , whatever that means . brett###gardner said rodriguez was like a brother , and mariano###rivera called him a friend . yet rivera humble and classy , with a well earned reputation for integrity stands for everything rodriguez is not . rivera said he had not spoken with his friend in a while , and the bosch topic is taboo . i do n't think i would be the one to ask , rivera said . if he wanted to share with me but i do n't think i would start a conversation about something like that . fair enough the daily grind of a season is plenty for most players to worry about . but ignoring the bigger###picture , as francona said , had disastrous###consequences before , and players like teixeira want to keep pressing the issue . aggressively pursuing the suspects , he said , is not enough . just because you have police , that 's good but crime 's not good , and that 's what we 're doing , teixeira said . we 're breaking the rules here . you just do n't want to see it . it 's never going to get out of the game . you 're always going to have cheaters . in every walk of life , people are going to cheat at whatever they do . that 's unfortunate , but we should expect more out of ourselves . we really should . there 's no excuse for it . in the late '90s and early 2000s , you could claim ignorance . you ca n't claim ignorance anymore . there 's no place for it . teixeira was drafted in , the year barry###bonds blasted 73 home###runs to break mark###mcgwire 's record of . it was all a mirage , and for teixeira , it offended his basic sense of fair play . you knew it was going on you had to be really na ve to think that stuff was natural , teixeira said . as a fan , everyone was turning a blind###eye to it . now , once i got into pro baseball , i made a conscious decision that i was never going to do that . would my numbers be better if i did ? probably . would i be able to hold my head up high and look at kids in the eye ? no . it 's much more important for me to be able to look people in the eye and say i did it right than to have a couple of m.v.p . 's and have a few more home###runs at the end of my career . teixeira was active in the union in the early###years of steroid testing , when the players agreed to increase penalties . he said he was open to doing so again . we need to figure out what that right equation is , teixeira said . i do n't know what it is i 'm sure we 'll have more discussions but we ca n't have guys trying to beat the system . one of those guys just might be the man teixeira raced toward on that triumphant night in . it was the moment that should have defined rodriguez 's career , but never will .
salvador , brazil uruguay coach oscar tabarez paid###tribute to diego forlan after his side beat nigeria 2 1 in the confederations###cup with a goal from the striker in his 100th appearance for the national###team on thursday . describing the 34 year old as a great professional and a top striker , tabarez said forlan 's abilities were on full display in a victory that left uruguay hot###favourites to join spain in the semi###finals . the way he can use both feet , his ball###control , he showcased his talents today , the coach added . he won his 100th cap tonight and that is very important for him and it is a tribute to him that he has made it this far . tabarez 's side struggled for spells in a lacklustre match in which he took the rare step of fielding all three of his top class strikers in forlan , luis suarez and edinson###cavani . the three points were won more because of guts and good fortune than moments of brilliance , said tabarez . it was n't show football , we had to work hard , he said . circumstances , good luck and other imponderables were on our side and we are satisfied with what we have done . nigerian coach stephen###keshi blamed a lack of concentration for the loss and said his side had otherwise matched their vastly more experienced rivals . the difference was a lack of concentration at the second goal , keshi said . otherwise it was a good game , my players played well . it 's just that one or two minutes lack of concentration that caused the difference . i am impressed with what my boys did considering the difference in experience with a uruguayan team that has been together for six years against ours that has been together for a year , a year and a half . i ca n't question their commitment and i ca n't question their loyalty . they did everything . nigeria now need to beat spain on sunday and hope uruguay slip up against tahiti , who conceded 10 goals to the world and european###champions earlier on thursday . while spain are on a 23 game###unbeaten###streak , keshi refused to give up hope . of course we do have a chance , until the end of the 90 minutes you ca n't tell what is going to happen , he said .
new york defending###champion serena###williams walloped spain 's carla suarez navarro 6 0 6 0 to race into the semi###finals of the u.s . open on tuesday . top seed williams served up the dreaded double bagel in a blazing 52 minutes to set up a clash with fifth seed li###na , who earlier became china 's first u.s . open semi###finalist by beating russian ekaterina###makarova . honstly she 's a great player , said williams , blaming the windy conditions for the spaniard 's futility . the conditions today were so tough . it was not her best tennis today . suarez navarro 's consolation is a , 000 check on her 25th birthday for her first u.s . open quarter###final .
researchers at the massachusetts###institute###of###technology and boston###university have found a new clue to staying dry , and it has to do with time and texture . james c . bird , now of boston###university , and kripa k . varanasi at m.i.t. , and their colleagues , were considering the problem of icing , which is a version of getting wet , and they decided to focus on the time a water drop stays in contact with a surface . as they report in the nov . 21 issue of nature , there is a maximum amount of time a water drop can touch frozen material before it freezes and sticks , causing all sorts of problems for wings and machinery , for starters . they tested ways to shorten the amount of contact time , and recorded the tests with high###speed video , which they analyzed . a smooth###surface might seem most likely to repel water , but they found that a rough###surface , with ridges , for example , worked better . the key is the way a water drop changes shape and bounces off material that has been treated to make it super water###repellent . the drop flattens into a pancake , then recollects itself and bounces up . ridges broke up the drops , and the smaller droplets re formed and bounced away up to 40 percent quicker than the larger drops . with refinements , dr . varanasi said they hope to be able to cut the contact time by 80 percent . if it can then be adapted for industrial uses , it could benefit wind###turbines , other kinds of machines , and even the fashion industry . after their discovery , the scientist looked to nature to see if plants and animals had evolved the same trick . and they had . although the lotus leaf is often thought of as highly water###repellent , nasturtiums did better , with a rougher surface . and the morpho butterfly has wings that bounce water off the same way .
nothing kicks the brain into gear like a jolt of caffeine . for bees , that is . and they do n't need to stand in line for a triple soy latte . a new study###shows that the naturally caffeine laced nectar of some plants enhances the learning###process for bees , so that they are more likely to return to those flowers . the plant is using this as a drug to change a pollinator 's behavior for its own benefit , said geraldine wright , a honeybee brain specialist at newcastle###university in england , who , with her colleagues , reported those findings in science on thursday . the research , other scientists said , not only casts a new light on the ancient evolutionary interaction between plants and pollinators , but is an intriguing confirmation of deep similarities in brain chemistry across the animal###kingdom . plants are known to go to great###lengths to attract###pollinators . they produce all sorts of chemicals that affect animal###behavior sugar in nectar , memorable fragrances , even substances in fruit that can act like laxatives in the service of quick seed###dispersal . lars chittka , who studies bee behavior at queen###mary , university of london , and wrote a commentary on the research in the same issue of science , said that in the marketplace of plants seeking pollinators , the plants want their customers to remain###faithful , thus the sugary nectar and distinctive scents . the trick here , said dr . chittka , who was not involved in the research , is actually to influence the memorability of the signal using a psychoactive###drug . and that 's a new trick in the book for plants . robert a . raguso , who studies the interactions of plants and pollinators at cornell and was not part of the study , said in an e mail , it makes the reader think twice about where natural###products that have economic###importance to humans actually came from before we 'discovered' and co opted their biology . dr . wright did not set out to investigate the evolutionary stratagems of plants . rather , her goal was to use the honeybee as a model to study drugs that are commonly abused . about eight or nine years###ago , she said , i ran across this paper on caffeine in floral nectar . and then , she said , she thought , 'this could be quite interesting because there might be some ecological interaction between the plants and the pollinator . ' that 's how it started . several varieties of coffee and citrus plants have toxic concentrations of caffeine in leaves and other tissues , but low###concentrations , similar to that in weak coffee , in the nectar itself . the toxic concentrations help plants fend off predators . but dr . raguso pointed out a well known axiom that the dose makes the poison , a principle that dr . wright and her colleagues followed in lab experiments . she conducted learning experiments with bees to see if they associated a reward with an odor , the reward being either sugar water or a combination of sugar water and caffeine in the same concentrations found in the nectar of coffee and citrus plants . the effect of caffeine was not obvious at first , but as dr . wright refined her experiments , it became more clear that the chemical had a profound###effect on memory . if you put a low###dose of caffeine in the reward when you teach them this task , and the amount is similar to what we drink when we have weak coffee , they just do n't###forget that the odor is associated with the reward , she said . after 24 hours , three times as many bees remembered the connection between odor and reward if the reward contained caffeine . after 72 hours , twice as many remembered . they then tested the effect of caffeine on neurons in the bee brain and found that its action could lead to more sensitivity in neurons called kenyon cells , which are involved in learning and memory . dr . wright said that this was one plausible route for enhancing memory , but was not definitive . insect and human###brains are vastly different , and although caffeine has many effects in people , like increasing alertness , whether it improves memory is unclear . but the excitation of the kenyon cells was similar to the action of caffeine on cells in the hippocampus in a recent experiment on rats , dr . wright said . such similarities in neurochemistry that allow caffeine to affect mammalian and insect brains in similar ways may seem surprising , but insects like fruit###flies and the nervous systems of even more primitive organisms like nematodes have been used to study learning at the level of individual###cells and the chemistry that changes their activities . cori bargmann of rockefeller###university , who studies the brain and behavior of a microscopic roundworm called caenorhabditis###elegans , said that the bee findings added more support to the idea that some very ancient behaviors like learning must have very deep evolutionary roots . finding the common neurochemistry in such diverse creatures , she said , is like learning the vocabulary of the brain .
the very first meal a newborn lizard eats can change its life , influencing whether it leaves its birthplace and how many offspring it will have , according to a new study . a mere detail in life can make all the difference for the fate of individuals , said manuel massot , a researcher at the pierre###and###marie###curie###university in paris and an author of the study , published in the journal current###biology . dr . massot and pedro arag###n , of the national###museum of natural###sciences in madrid , studied zootoca vivipara , a live bearing species that does not lay eggs like most other lizards . they captured 120 pregnant lizards from c vennes national###park in southern france to study in a laboratory . after the lizards gave###birth , the newborns were released into the park . half had been given their first meals in the lab the others had to fend for themselves . the lizards were then studied over two years . those that were fed in the lab were less likely to move from the spot where they were released they were also harder to capture again . curiously , the lizards that did not get the early meal gave###birth to larger litters two years later . this type of strong response to a seemingly small event is known as phenotypic resonance and is probably more common in early###life , dr . massot said . he suspects that other animals , including###humans , may be similarly affected by small events .
san###francisco there were times after he told his parents he was gay , for example , and his mother wept and his father tried to hit him when fredy bolvito curled up on a bench in union square here and cried because he had aids and no job and no place to stay and he felt , he said , that my life was over . but there were also days when he sat on the bench in the square and sang the star###spangled###banner , looking up at the flags atop the westin st . francis###hotel and thinking , that 's breathtaking , that 's my american###dream . or when he mingled with tourists , giving them directions to the cable###cars , or gazed through the windows at the shoppers in macy 's and was saddened by how rich and healthy they looked . he scavenged for meals in garbage bins . he avoided the homeless###shelters , where he had heard that gays were taunted , or worse . his angel , he said , was in the center of the square the statue victory , a trident in one hand , a wreath in the other . i would look at it at night and think , 'oh my god , that 's my hope , ' he said . san###francisco is often viewed as a mecca for gay people . but the warmth of the city 's welcome can quickly vanish for those who are poor . city leaders were startled this year when a survey revealed that 29 percent of the homeless population about , 100 of the , 350 people counted identified themselves as gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgender . bevan dufty , the director of the city 's homelessness initiatives , said he was surprised the percentage held true for all age###groups , even adults and the elderly . what was really staggering was to see that it did n't###change as you got older , he said . the survey found that gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgender people who are homeless had higher###rates of disability than homeless heterosexuals and were more likely to be homeless when they arrived in the city . some of them were older gay men with aids who had been evicted from their apartments or people who had been cast out by their families in other states . others , like mr . bolvito , a native of guatemala who graduated from college in hayward , calif . , with a degree in political###science and once worked as a real###estate###agent , had good jobs that disappeared during the recession . in response to the findings , mr . dufty and kara zordel , a coordinator of homeless connect , organized an event in october that offered medical and dental###services and other assistance to gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people who are homeless . and in august , the city 's planning###commission approved permits for a 24 bed shelter with a focus on helping them . the shelter is expected to open in the coming###months . other cities have shown interest in san###francisco 's efforts , mr . dufty said . officials from santa###clara and phoenix attended the homeless connect event . brian basinger , a co founder of the aids housing alliance in san###francisco , said the harassment of gays is common in the city 's shelters . people there do not have a lot of status in society to begin with , and so the way they protect or generate status in these social###environments is to step on the queers , mr . basinger said . gay and transgender residents have their shoes stolen , he said . they are robbed or beaten up in line . mr . basinger , whose partner was homeless for 10 years and who came close to being homeless himself after he developed aids , brought in an architect to design the new shelter . i really wanted to think about how does the built###environment impact people 's experiences , he said . so we spent a lot of time thinking that through and talking to people and designing something that was going to be functional and respect people 's dignity . but the shelter will house only a fraction of those who are without homes . on a recent evening in the castro district , hjalmar bjorkman , 48 , sat cross legged in a doorway . he has lived in the bay###area for years . but two months###ago , he said , he lost his job at a bar and his partner kicked him out . since then , he has been sleeping on the sidewalk behind an old theater , he said , or at the home of a friend , who charges him 20 a night for the couch . my ex partner walks by me every day , mr . bjorkman said . bobby spencer , 47 , arrived###in###san###francisco from atlanta in may , thinking he had a job as a nanny with a former co worker at the company where he had worked as an executive###assistant . he was excited about the move . being gay in the south is still a lot different than being gay here , even in atlanta , he said . i moved here to be queer , that was part of the plan . but the job did not work out and , after having volunteered in soup###kitchens in atlanta , mr . spencer abruptly found himself without a place to stay .
denver for a judge who would go on to make same###sex###marriage legal in utah , a deep red state where streets in the capital are numbered by their distance from the mormon temple , robert j . shelby arrived on the bench with enthusiastic praise from republican leaders . he had been a combat###engineer in the persian###gulf conflict and was , according to state voter records , a registered###republican . senator###orrin g . hatch , a seven term utah republican , recommended him for a federal###judgeship , calling him an experienced lawyer with an unwavering commitment to the law . senator mike###lee , a tea###party republican , said that mr . shelby was pre eminently qualified and predicted he would be an outstanding judge . now , less than two years since he joined the bench , the same###sex###marriage case has transformed judge shelby into a hero for hundreds of newlywed gay couples and an object of derision for many social###conservatives who supported utah 's 2004 ban on such unions . gov . gary r . herbert , a republican , called him an activist federal###judge , and state lawyers are already trying to have higher###courts roll back his decision , potentially undoing as many as 900 new same sex###marriages . state officials are expected to ask the united###states###supreme###court as early as monday to halt the waves of same sex unions that began minutes after judge shelby handed down his decision on dec . 20 that utah 's measure barring same###sex###marriage violated the united###states###constitution . utah leaders say the rush of marriages has sown chaos , and say they should be halted until the legal###case is resolved . judge shelby has already refused to stay his own decision , and the united###states court of appeals for the 10th circuit also denied utah 's request to stop the marriages . utah 's request will initially land with justice sonia###sotomayor , who oversees the 10th circuit . she is expected to refer it to the entire court , and the justices could rule within days . it is an unlikely cacophony created by a man who quietly ascended through utah 's legal ranks , mostly avoiding media attention , law###review articles and other totems of success in the legal###profession . born in fort###atkinson , wis . , judge shelby , 43 , moved to utah for college and now lives in salt###lake###city with his wife and their two children . as a young###man , he worked for snappy car###rental and was a night manager at a maceys grocery###store in logan , utah . he spent his legal career in private###practice , working on white###collar###criminal defense , commercial###law and serious personal###injury lawsuits . he was a member of the defense###team representing olympic officials in salt###lake###city accused of bribery in the city 's efforts to win the 2002 winter games . in his senate###confirmation questions , he said he did free legal work for poorer criminal###defendants usually about two cases a year . so many people thought he was so good , just brilliant , said andrew morse , president of snow , christensen and martineau , the firm where judge shelby had been a shareholder when he was nominated to the bench . he 's just easy to get along with , always says the right thing . he was active in the state and local bar###associations , and was a leader in a group that mentors young trial lawyers . but he largely###stayed out of the spotlight and away from politics . in , he and his wife gave a 50 contribution to a republican###candidate for the state legislature the only political donation found in state and national###campaign finance databases . former colleagues said they did not know his religious background . the judge did not respond to emails and a phone call requesting an interview . his answers###to###questions about empathy in judges , and whether judges should protect the little guy , are as mild as a glass of milk . i believe it is the judge 's responsibility to reach decisions based exclusively on the application of established precedent to the specific facts presented , he wrote . but this month , when it was time to decide a case brought by three gay couples challenging utah 's ban on same sex###marriages , judge shelby appeared to be moved by their stories . in his 50 page ruling , he repeated the stories of how each couple met and fell in love , referring to them not only as plaintiffs or by last name , but as derek and moudi , karen and kate , laurie and kody . he wrote that utah 's voter approved ban on same###sex###marriage violated the constitution 's guarantees of equal###protection under the law , and said that the ban denied gay and lesbian couples their fundamental right to marry .
washington you might call north###dakota the antithesis of president###obama 's political base . whites make up 90 percent of its population , which is fewer than one million people and mostly in rural###areas . its proportion of people 65 and over exceeds the national###average . there was never a chance that north###dakota would give mr . obama its three electoral###votes . so mr . obama has not given north###dakota his time . it is one of six states he has not visited as president , along with south###dakota , arkansas , idaho , south###carolina and utah . he has gone just once to kansas , kentucky , mississippi , montana , nebraska , tennessee and wyoming . mr . obama 's near complete absence from more than 25 percent of the states , from which he is politically estranged , is no surprise , reflecting routine cost###benefit calculations of the modern presidency . but in a country splintered by partisanship and race , it may have consequences . america 's 21 st century politics , as underscored by the immigration debate embroiling congress , increasingly pits the preferences of a dwindling , republican###leaning white majority against those of expanding , democratic###leaning hispanic and black minorities . even some sympathetic observers fault mr . obama as not doing all he could to pull disparate###elements of society closer . every president should make an attempt to bridge the divide , said donna###brazile , an african###american democratic strategist . it 's a tall order . i would n't give him high marks . al cross , who directs the institute for rural journalism and community issues at the university of kentucky , said , you 're president of the whole country . by all but ignoring the state , he added , mr . obama has allowed negative sentiment toward his presidency to deepen . america 's political###polarization has of course gathered force for decades mr . obama merely inherited it . his aides note , accurately , that he has faced concerted , implacable republican opposition like senator mitch###mcconnell of kentucky , who declared his goal of ensuring a one term obama presidency . while a president 's destinations carry symbolic weight , the entire###country sees him through news###coverage wherever he goes . but mr . obama burst onto the national stage as a bridge builder whose biracial ancestry spanned the white kansas heartland and emerging minority###communities . his 2004 democratic###convention speech gained moral###force by scorning the fact that pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states . there 's not a liberal america and a conservative america , mr . obama said then . there 's not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian america there 's the united###states###of###america . as mr . obama 's travel shows , his white###house has sliced and diced as finely as any . according to figures compiled by mark knoller of cbs###news , an unofficial white###house historian , mr . obama has visited the swing states of colorado 19 times , florida 30 times , iowa 18 times , nevada 17 times and ohio 39 times . that precision targeting paid off last november when mr . obama defeated mitt###romney in every swing###state but north###carolina . his winning###formula higher margins than john###kerry racked up against president george w . bush in 2004 among blacks , hispanics , asians , city###dwellers and young###voters , even as he suffered larger deficits among whites , rural###residents and older voters . it was a practical adaptation to what mr . obama faced while pursuing policy goals on economic###recovery and health###care . resistance ranged from traditional###republican foes in washington , to the tea###party###movement , to the birthers on the political fringe who refused to accept the legitimacy of his citizenship . i think that he was genuinely startled by the intensity of the polarization he encountered , said william galston , domestic###policy director in president###bill###clinton 's white###house . he reacted to that in effect by saying , 'never mind i 'm not going to beat my head against the wall . ' mr . bush traced a similar arc . he ran in 2000 as a uniter , not a divider , but later subordinated that priority to his divisive prosecution of the iraq###war .
los###angeles dan###uggla 's batting###average is the last thing on his mind . the slugging second baseman prefers to concentrate on home###runs , rbis and the atlanta###braves' comfortable lead atop the nl###east . uggla had two homers and four rbis in an 8 1 victory over the los###angeles###dodgers on sunday . it was the 18th multihomer game for the three time all star and his second this year . since the start of the 2006 season , his first in the majors , uggla leads all players at his position with 222 home###runs 42 more than yankees slugger robinson cano . he entered this four game series hitting . 183 . the batting###average is what it is , uggla said . i mean , it ai n't the first time i 've hit . 180 , . 170 , . 160 , whatever . but i throw those numbers out the door . the way i look at it , we 're eight games up right now and that 's without me doing anything at all . but i know what i 'm capable of doing . and if i can be more consistent and help these guys out by driving in some runs , that 's all that matters . you always want to feel like you matter and feel like you were a factor . there were a lot of times this year where i did n't . so to get some homers and drive in some runs feels good , he added . freddie###freeman drove in three runs with a double and mike minor kept the braves' rotation rolling with six solid innings . atlanta had an eight game lead over second place washington the largest of any division leader pending the nightcap of the nationals' doubleheader against minnesota . the braves , who won the season series , grabbed a###4 1 lead with four runs in the third against rookie matt magill . all of them were unearned because of an error by three time gold###glove first baseman adrian###gonzalez , who fielded justin###upton 's dribbler a few feet from the foul###line and dropped the ball while making a hurried attempt to tag him . it was his seventh error , two more than he had last season . freeman 's single loaded the bases , and evan###gattis followed with a sacrifice###fly before uggla drove a 2 1 pitch into the dodgers' bullpen in left###field . he led off the fifth against ronald belisario with his 13th of the season and third in two days . he 's a veteran player , he 's been around a while and he 's seen every kind of pitch . so nothing can fool him , magill said . but if you do n't have good command , you ca n't get anybody out . minor ( 8 2 ) allowed a run and six hits , struck out six and walked three while helping the braves gain a split of the four game series . the left hander is 5 0 with a . 76 era over his last seven starts . atlanta 's rotation has yielded four runs in 37 1 3 innings spanning the team 's last six games . the stretch includes eight innings of one hit ball by rookie julio teheran who came within four outs of a no###hitter on wednesday against pittsburgh and back to back starts by tim###hudson and paul###maholm in which each allowed one run in braves losses . it 's just a friendly competition among everybody . you always want to top the guy before you , minor said . magill was charged with seven runs three earned and four hits over 3 2 3 innings in his sixth major###league start , none of which the dodgers have won . the 23 year old right hander from simi###valley issued six walks , giving him 28 in 27 2 3 innings and a . 51 era . he was recalled sunday from triple a albuquerque to fill in for ted###lilly , who was n't able to pitch because of a neck sprain and was placed on the disabled###list for the third time this season . it 's tough not being able to have a set schedule and not being able to pitch every five days , said magill , who gave up nine walks last sunday at colorado in a 7 2 loss . but when they need you here , you 've got to make sacrifices and still be able to compete . that 's why it 's so frustrating , because i 'm not giving myself a chance to win games . i know in my head i can do it , but my body 's just not hooking up right now the way i want it to and my fastball command has n't been there . atlanta increased the margin to 7 1 in the fourth when magill loaded the bases with his second walk of the inning and gave up freeman 's three run double just beyond the outstretched glove of center###fielder skip###schumaker after getting a visit from pitching coach rick###honeycutt . when you 've got bases###loaded and two outs , you just want to try and get at least one more run , said freeman , second in the nl in hitting with runners in scoring###position . i 'm not trying to do anything differently with guys on base . i just try to hit the ball hard every single at bat , and for some reason they seem to fall with people on . i was fortunate to get one in the gap and luckily he did n't make that play . it 's always nice to kind of blow it open a little bit and let mike###settle in . los###angeles loaded the bases with none out in the first on the first of three hits by electrifying rookie yasiel###puig , a bunt single by nick###punto and a walk to gonzalez . puig was forced at the plate on a grounder and luis cruz struck out , but schumaker drove in punto with an infield single . that extended his career###high hitting###streak to 15 games , the longest by a dodgers player this season . notes puig completed his first week in the majors with 13 hits in 28 at bats , four homers and 10 rbis in

syosset , n.y . only one n.h.l . player who played overseas during the lockout has refused to return to his team . the reluctant islanders defenseman lubomir visnovsky was asked to report to training###camp by monday###morning or face suspension . instead , he was still in his native slovakia with his team , slovan###bratislava of the kontinental###hockey###league . a photograph on slovan 's facebook###page showed visnovsky on the team bus , headed to the czech###republic for tuesday 's game against lev prague . whether visnovsky will play in that game was unclear . an agreement between the n.h.l . and the k.h.l . bars players under contract with a team in one league from playing in the other . bill daly , the n.h.l . deputy###commissioner , said in an e mail message monday , we had further contact with the k.h.l . today , and they continue to assert that visnovsky will be ineligible to play in k.h.l . games without the islanders' consent . ilya kochevrin , the k.h.l . 's head spokesman , said in an e mail message monday that the matter will be decided tomorrow . the islanders confirmed monday that they had neither suspended visnovsky nor given consent for him to remain with slovan . visnovsky told a slovakian newspaper monday that he wanted to stay with slovan because of family issues , but he conceded that the islanders had a right to be upset with him . i hope they 'll give me some time , and then i 'll see , visnovsky said . maybe i 'll go there this season . visnovsky 's agent , neil sheehy , said , lubo has personal###reasons for not reporting to the islanders right now , all of which have absolutely nothing to do with the new york islanders . he continued , referring to the islanders' general###manager , lubo admires garth###snow , and we will have to see how this situation plays out . the islanders were hoping visnovsky would play the point on the power play and produce the way he did for anaheim two seasons ago , when he had 68 points in 81 games . the islanders are hoping to reach the playoffs for the first time in six seasons . we had our meetings throughout the summer , and we had him as the first unit power play guy , coach jack capuano said of visnovsky . like i tell my players , there 's controllable circumstances and there 's uncontrollable circumstances , and i ca n't###control it . he 's not here , and we just have to move on and worry about the guys that we have now . this is the second time visnovsky has spurned the islanders . when he was acquired from anaheim in june , he refused to report , citing a no trade clause in his contract . an arbitrator ruled in the islanders' favor . two years###ago , another player refused to report the islanders . in , detroit signed goalie evgeni###nabokov from ska st . petersburg in the k.h.l. , but the islanders claimed him off waivers . nabokov did not report , and the islanders suspended him for the rest of the season . he joined the islanders for the 2011 12 season . every situation is different , nabokov said . we do n't know the details , so i ca n't really make a judgment . from what i heard , we do n't know everything that 's going on . the young###kids will have to make the most of this opportunity . nabokov was referring to defenseman griffin reinhart , the son of the longtime calgary defenseman paul###reinhart and an islanders first###round###draft###pick in june . reinhart and forward ryan strome , another first rounder , make an impressive pair of prospects . but capuano is not rushing them into the lineup . we 're talking about elite junior players who have a tremendous jump to make to the national###hockey###league level with five days of training###camp , capuano said . we 'll see how the week progresses . in the meantime the islanders will depend on their few stars when the 48 game season opens saturday . it 's going to be an exciting sprint right to the end of april , and we 're looking to be right in it , said john###tavares , the islanders' top center . tavares scored 42 points in 28 games for sc###bern in switzerland during the lockout . we 're not going to worry about anyone who 's not here , tavares said . it 's about the group that 's in this room representing the islanders and what we want to accomplish .
jackson , miss . the oxford police###chief says mississippi guard marshall henderson appeared to be in possession of a small amount of marijuana and cocaine during a traffic###stop in may . henderson , a 6 foot 2 senior from hurst , texas , was suspended###indefinitely by coach andy kennedy on wednesday for violation of team rules , but no other reason was given . the wall###street###journal first reported the traffic###stop , citing a police report . chief joey east confirmed the incident thursday , saying henderson was cited for not having proof of insurance . he said no other charges were filed and henderson was never arrested . an ole###miss spokesman declined comment . kennedy did not immediately return a message seeking comment . east said officers told him henderson was very cooperative during the stop and it 's not uncommon for police to find small###amounts of a suspected controlled###substance but file no charges because of a cooperative suspect . the wall###street###journal says police reports show henderson was pulled over may 4 on suspicion of speeding . an officer smelled marijuana in henderson 's vehicle and henderson handed the officer a bag with a small nugget of marijuana . the report also says a search by a police###dog found a clear###plastic bag that contained a small amount of what appeared to be cocaine . according to the newspaper , the officer noted in the report that the district###attorney would n't prosecute such a small amount of cocaine . east said the suspected marijuana and cocaine were not tested and officers did not determine henderson was under the influence of any drugs or alcohol . if they had suspected that , he would have been arrested , east said . henderson averaged . 1 points per game last season , helping the rebels advance to the ncaa###tournament for the first time since . henderson came to ole###miss his fourth college with a history of discipline problems . he was arrested in 2009 for misdemeanor forgery after buying marijuana with counterfeit###money and again in 2011 for misdemeanor possession###of###marijuana . he served time in jail after the second arrest because he violated his probation . ole###miss has said the coaches were aware of henderson 's past when he signed with the program . it 's not the first time henderson has made headlines during this offseason . he wrote a message in april for the university 's website , thanking ole###miss fans for their support and vaguely apologizing to anyone i offended . the flamboyant guard rarely hesitated to needle opposing fans during one of his frequent scoring sprees . he was also reprimanded by the ncaa in june for making an inappropriate gesture following the rebels' loss to lasalle in the third round of the ncaa###tournament . now comes his most recent suspension , which puts his future with the program in doubt . since the season ended , we have talked a lot about marshall taking a greater leadership role with our team , kennedy said in wednesday 's statement . with that comes greater###responsibility , and he must do a better job of living up to the high standard we expect from him and he desires from himself .
miami the play should have been over , two , three , four times . it should have died when tony###parker nearly lost the ball driving###past chris###bosh . or when he nearly lost it again trying to evade lebron###james . or when he slipped to the floor , his left knee down , his legs splayed awkwardly . or when he launched a shot that maybe maybe beat the 24 second buzzer by a hundredth of a second . like an alley###cat spending all nine lives at once , parker flirted with disaster at every turn late thursday , before sinking the most improbable of jump shots , helping the san###antonio###spurs secure a 92 88 victory over the miami###heat in the opener of the n.b.a . finals . the ball barely slipped past james 's outstretched###hand , 16 feet from the basket . it struck the backboard , struck the front of the rim , bounced up and dropped through with . 2 seconds###left . replays would show that the ball left parker 's hand just as the shot###clock expired . the play seemed to take forever , like a 26 second possession , heat coach erik###spoelstra said . the longest 24 seconds i 've been a part of , james said with a rueful smile . it was a dizzying , chaotic , fantastic sequence that effectively showed what this series will come down to inches , microseconds , happenstance . tony did everything wrong , james said , and did everything right in the same possession . the heat had held the lead nearly all night , by as many as 9 points , and by 3 early in the fourth###quarter . james delivered a triple###double with 18 points , 18 rebounds and 10 assists . dwyane###wade produced 17 points . and yet the night ended with the heat losing home###court###advantage , after an unusually sloppy finish . miami had five turnovers in the final###quarter and converted just 5 of 18 shots , while being outscored . so for the second straight year , the heat are facing a 1 0 deficit in the finals . game 2 is sunday , also at american###airlines###arena , before the series shifts to san###antonio for three games . the last time the spurs appeared on the finals stage , six years###ago , they were walking off with a four game sweep of james 's cleveland###cavaliers . parker left clutching the finals m.v.p . trophy . parker was still magnificent thursday , scoring 21 points on 9 of 18 shooting , including 10 points in the final###quarter . james himself checked parker down the stretch , to little effect . tim###duncan added 20 points and 14 rebounds . the spurs seized###control with an 11 3 run , sparked by parker and capped by a danny green 3 pointer , for an 88 81 lead . the heat got few good looks after that , but they cut the deficit to 90 88 on james 's two free throws with . 3 seconds to go . the game then came down to parker , dribbling for an entire possession , dribbling to his left , then back to his right and then right into the heart of the heat defense and into trouble . it was a crazy play , parker said . i thought i lost the ball three or four times . and it did n't work out like i wanted it to . at the end , i was just trying to get a shot up . wade missed a layup at the other end , finishing a scoreless fourth###quarter . because the spurs rested their stars in november and the heat did the same in march , these teams had not faced each other at full strength in two years , leaving no road###map for what the night , or the series , would bring . you do n't have no rhythm of what they 're going to do , james said before tipoff . they do n't have a rhythm of what we 're going to do . so it 's like the first test we 've had with one another in a while . really , there were few surprises as the game unfolded . miami did what it does best , spreading the floor with shooters , letting james orchestrate and , whenever possible , taking advantage in transition . the heat hit 8 of 25 3 pointers and scored just 9 points on the fast###break . the spurs did what they do best , scoring inside ( 40 points in the paint ) and on second chance points , essentially picking up where the indiana###pacers left off in the eastern###conference###finals . the spurs had not played in nearly 10 days , since sweeping the memphis###grizzlies in the western###conference###finals . there figured to be a little rust in their game . the heat had the opposite concern , having survived a taut , seven game series against the indiana###pacers that ended just three nights earlier . there figured to be a little fatigue in their game . as it turned out , rest proved to be a more critical###factor than rust . wade and james both cited fatigue as a factor in the heat 's poor finish . we looked like a team that came off a seven game series , wade said . i thought we got some shots we wanted , but we were a little careless at times as well . the spurs , by contrast , committed just four turnovers for the game , tying a finals record set by the detroit###pistons ( against the spurs ) in the 2005 finals . by the end of the first quarter , the spurs had already used three players , of varying###sizes , to check james kawhi###leonard ( 6 feet 7 inches , 225 pounds , danny green , 210 ) and boris###diaw , 235 ) . when james easily backed down green , the spurs sent two more bodies , leaving half the floor open . later , james plowed right through green , driving for the layup and then looking at green as if to say , you cannot possibly guard me . james had 10 points , 8 rebounds and 5 assists by halftime , methodically building toward his third triple###double in a finals . duncan had a rough start , missing his first five shots and picking up two fouls in the first 11 minutes , sending him to the bench . he recovered nicely , however , hitting 5 of 7 shots in the second quarter , including a 20 footer at the halftime buzzer that cut the heat 's lead to . it was a promising###start to what promised to be a compelling finals , pitting the league 's premier glamour team ( the heat ) against its greatest small###market success###story ( the spurs . between them , the spurs and the heat have six championships , nine finals appearances and at least five probable hall of famers . you could call it a matchup made in n.b.a . heaven , a nice send off to david###stern before he steps down as commissioner next february . a heck of a series , stern said in his pre finals address , probably the best that i could possibly expect for my last finals . lebron###james has scored , 712 points in the postseason , moving into 11th on the career###postseason list , passing magic###johnson , 701 ) . ... tony###parker , manu ginobili and tim###duncan have 99 playoff###victories as a threesome , the second most in n.b.a . history , behind the lakers' kareem###abdul###jabbar , magic###johnson and michael###cooper , who won . ... teams that have won game 1 of the finals are 47 19 in the series .
washington ( ap ) sales of used homes dipped in march as the supply remained tight . but the pace remained ahead of last year 's . the national###association###of###realtors said monday that sales fell . 6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual###rate of . 92 million , from . 95 million in february . the february figure was revised lower . still , sales in march were . 3 percent higher than a year earlier . sales have remained mostly unchanged in the last four months largely , analysts have said , because of a limited###supply of homes . economists still predict the housing###market will continue to recover this year . the low supply , combined with rising###demand for housing , could accelerate construction in coming###months . the realtors' group said buyer traffic was 25 percent higher than a year ago . a disappointing result for u.s . existing home sales , but with inventories still very tight , the outlook remains favorable , jennifer h . lee , an economist at bmo capital###markets , said in a note to clients . a steady housing recovery is providing###support to the economy this year . builders are starting work on more homes , increasing construction jobs . and home###prices are rising . higher###prices tend to make homeowners feel wealthier and encourage more spending . but the pace of purchases of used homes has been little changed in recent###months , partly because of the tight inventory . the supply of available homes has fallen nearly 17 percent in the last year to . 93 million . at the current sales pace , that supply would be exhausted in . 7 months , less than the six months typical in a healthy market . the supply rose . 6 percent from february to march . the realtors' group says it expects a much bigger increase in supply this month as the spring selling season began . the tight supply helps###explain rising###prices . the median price rose . 8 percent from february to march to , 300 , the biggest one month gain since . the higher median price partly reflects bigger increases in sales of more expensive###homes . sales of homes priced from , 000 to , 000 jumped . 3 percent from a year earlier . by contrast , sales of homes priced from , 000 to , 000 rose just . 1 percent . first time buyers , who usually drive housing recoveries , are playing a smaller role in the current rebound . they accounted for 30 percent of sales last month , the same as in february . first time buyers usually make up about 40 percent of buyers in a healthy market . one bright sign in the report is that the percentage of so called distressed sales fell sharply . distressed sales include foreclosed homes and homes in which the size of the mortgage exceeds the value of the home . those sales fell to 21 percent of the total in march , down from 25 percent in february . that is the lowest###proportion since the realtors' group began###tracking the figure in october . since the housing###bubble burst more than six years###ago , banks have imposed tighter credit conditions and required larger down payments . those changes have left many would be buyers unable to qualify for very low mortgage rates . mortgage rates dropped last week to near record###lows . the average rate for a 30 year fixed mortgage dropped to . 41 percent from . 43 percent . that is not far from the record###low of . 31 percent last november .
cooperstown , n.y . ambition has never been in short supply at the alice busch opera theater , the cozy 900 seat auditorium that long housed the glimmerglass###opera , and now is the principal setting for its successor , the glimmerglass festival . but even measured by the high standard this annual affair has sustained , this year 's festival which runs through aug . 24 here rises to new levels of innovation , curiosity and , yes , chutzpah . make no mistake , that 's meant as praise . it takes a certain kind of fearlessness to conceive and execute a summer###series in which the most conventional offering is wagner 's flying###dutchman . one of two shows directed by francesca###zambello , the festival 's renowned and provocative general and artistic###director , the production is the first glimmerglass staging of one of wagner 's canonical works . ( das liebesverbot , wagner 's second opera , was mounted here in , during michael macleod 's brief tenure at the helm . ) compared to last season 's notorious topical updating of verdi 's aida and to the other works in this year 's festival , which include a popular broadway musical , a fascinating pair of staged vocal works not intended for the theater , and a rare verdi flop the flying###dutchman was presented in an essentially traditional###manner . but ms . zambello 's resourceful , riveting conception , seen on thursday , still illuminates fresh depths and currents in this wagner seafaring tale . credit the casting with at least part of the effect . the seaman of the title may have been cursed to wander the seas for eternity until finding a woman willing to pledge fidelity . but in ryan mckinny , a lithe , handsome bass###baritone outfitted by the costume###designer erik teague in a leather###jacket worn open to expose a full chest tattoo , ms . zambello offered a dutchman who seemed unusually close in age and bearing to senta , the virtuous young###woman whose love could provide his salvation . the lustrous soprano melody moore played senta with a reckless passion that matched mr . mckinny 's brooding intensity , their interactions suffusing the goings on with an unmistakable erotic charge . mark mccullough 's vivid lighting and james noone 's stark set a towering metal scaffolding that frames the stage senta 's bed billowing sheets and dangling ropes intersected in ways that blurred distinctions between reality and feverish dream . the tenor jay hunter morris , a wagnerian hero to be reckoned with after his portrayals of siegfried at the metropolitan###opera and the san###francisco###opera , gave a powerfully sung , physically impassioned account of erik , senta 's discarded lover . peter volpe 's bluff daland injected a welcome note of levity . adam bielamowicz , a tenor , was a bright steersman . and the conductor john keenan elicited properly elemental surges and billows from the glimmerglass festival orchestra . despite recounting the torrid tale of the rise and fall of king###arthur 's round###table , camelot ( seen on friday###night ) contained few comparable frissons of intensity or passion . directed by robert longbottom with elegantly spare sets by kevin depinet , sumptuous costumes by paul tazewell and sensitive lighting by robert wierzel , this lerner and loewe chestnut offered bright whimsy , understated heartache and a string of good tunes , well sung and played . the suave baritone nathan###gunn , the glimmerglass festival 's artist in residence this season , unsurprisingly made for a handsome , secure lancelot . andriana chuchman , a winsome soprano , sang sweetly as guenevere , bringing out the role 's devilish streak especially well . but the standout performance was david pittsinger 's charismatic , nuanced arthur , touchingly characterized and nobly voiced . two musical theater actors , wynn harmon as merlyn pellinore and jack###noseworthy as mordred , did lively work . clay hilley , noel bouley and wayne hu , all from glimmerglass 's exemplary young###artists program , were admirable knights . the chorus sang and danced well , and the conductor james###lowe drew a delicious performance from the orchestra . passions , a new production that opened on saturday###night , ventured furthest from standard notions of operatic fare . conceived by ms . zambello as a means by which to stage the little match girl passion , david###lang 's 2008 pulitzer###prize winning work for vocal###quartet , the event paired a new arrangement of that piece with a dance oriented rendition of pergolesi 's 1736 stabat###mater , directed by the choreographer jessica lang ( no relation to mr . lang . the pergolesi work , a reflection on mary 's suffering at christ 's crucifixion , fluctuates between somberness and ecstasy , shadow and light a complex mix brilliantly personified by the soprano nadine sierra and the countertenor anthony roth costanzo , complemented by mr . mccullough 's deft stage illumination and speranza scappucci 's eloquent conducting .
with the technologically###advanced , boeing offered airlines big fuel savings and better comfort for passengers . it also promised something else the ability to reach just about any airport on the globe without having to stop . boeing designed the jet to fly 330 minutes five and a half###hours from the nearest###airport at any point on its routes , a feature that would allow extended flights over water or deserted regions like the north###pole . that held tremendous appeal for airlines , which often must stay within three hours of emergency###landing spots , and boeing estimated that 450 new routes would be created . but boeing is struggling to get past the 787 's recent smoke and fire episodes with its lithium###ion###batteries that have led to the grounding of all 50 planes delivered so far . and with investigators in the united###states and japan still looking for the cause of those problems , it could be months before federal###regulators would feel###confident enough in boeing 's redesign of the batteries to approve extending 787 flights to ultralong distances from the jetliner 's current three hour limit . that could dilute its appeal to some airlines and further raise the costs of the program for boeing , which already was unlikely to make a profit on any 787s for at least two years . the company could lose orders and have to pay penalties to carriers if the 787 failed to meet its performance###targets . it is crucially important that the powers that be get convinced that boeing can contain and exhaust a fire , and that the fix really worked , said hans j . weber , the president of tecop international , an aviation consulting###firm . he said that even after the jets start flying again , boeing and the airlines would have to monitor the activity inside the batteries for tens###of###thousands of flight###hours before experts would feel sure enough that the fixes would prevent a fire or that the jet 's range could be safely expanded . federal###aviation###administration officials said it was premature to speculate about what they might decide about the plane 's range . boeing said friday that it had not changed its goal to win approval for the longer flights . the 787 fleet was grounded in january after the battery in one jet ignited in boston and another battery began smoldering on a flight in japan . boeing and other companies that rely on the volatile lithium###ion###batteries , including hybrid carmakers , worry about public###perceptions of the batteries and want to get the planes back up in the air as soon as possible . the f.a.a . is expected to approve a plan next week to start testing the possible fixes . mr . weber said that several studies had suggested that jetliners have an average of 18 to 20 minutes to land if a fire erupts without special containment in a cargo or equipment bay . and it could take 20 minutes more to get all the passengers###and###crew###members off the plane , he said . as a result , george w . hamlin , an aviation consultant , said he believed that to justify even its current ability to fly up to three hours from the nearest###airport , boeing would have to demonstrate that its new battery case could contain a fire for at least 180 minutes . otherwise , he said , the plane 's appeal could diminish . having a fire in a plane is a situation all pilots dread . ( they are trained to find the nearest landing###spot . ) but containing a potential fire could be an acceptable answer for the f.a.a. , mr . weber and mr . hamlin said . the agency already has many requirements to offset other safety concerns on planes . for instance , mr . weber said , the f.a.a . accepts the risk of one engine failing in flight by requiring that all twin###engine jets can fly on the remaining one . and while the current rule that 787s must stay within three hours of airports is sufficient for most north###american , trans###atlantic and even many flights across the pacific###ocean , several middle###eastern , australian and asian airlines are counting on the extension to gain more flexibility in their routes and maximize the fuel savings from the plane . the part of the raison###d' tre in the design of the 787 is being able to connect virtually anywhere , mr . hamlin said .
new york a badly out of sorts roger###federer spoke of a crisis of confidence after he self destructed in a stunning fourth###round defeat to unfancied spaniard tommy###robredo at the u.s . open on monday . the 17 times grand###slam###champion was eliminated 7 6 ( 3 ) 6 3 6 4 in less than two and a half###hours to end hopes of a blockbuster showdown with great###rival rafa nadal in the quarter###finals . the swiss 's erratic display included a most unfederer like 43 unforced###errors and left 14 of 16 break###points going begging at louis###armstrong stadium . confidence takes###care of all the things you do n't usually think about , federer told###reporters , his stinging defeat reminiscent of his shock second round exit at wimbledon two months before . maybe my consistency is just not quite there yet . maybe on a daily###basis , set by set or point by point basis , maybe that 's something that has been difficult for me . maybe that was one of the reasons why i lost today , playing up and down . i kind of self destructed , which is very disappointing . another bout of foul###weather took federer away from his favored center court at arthur###ashe###stadium , relegating the former world number one to the secondary show court , where he had not appeared since . although filled to capacity , federer gave the louis###armstrong stadium crowd precious few reasons to roar as he struggled against an opponent he had beaten in all 10 of their previous###meetings . i kind of feel like i beat myself , without taking any credit away from tommy , federer said . clearly he was making sure he was making many balls . it was up to me to make the difference and i could n't . federer appeared impatient on most of his break###point chances , miscuing a stream of groundstrokes to let robredo off the hook . it was his earliest exit from the year 's last grand###slam since a fourth###round loss in . i think i explained it enough , federer said . it just ended up being a bad combination of many things today . i 've definitely got to go back to work and come back stronger . get rid of this loss as quick as i can , forget about it , because that 's not how i want to play from here on . i want to play better . i know i can . i showed it the last few weeks , that there is that level . federer said the much hyped clash with nadal was the last thing on his mind when he took to the court and defended his usual laidback appearance as the game slipped from his fingers . if i 'm playing like this , i 'm not going to beat rafa , or kohlschreiber for that matter , he said . for me , i did n't think of that . i 've been too often in this situation . i was fighting with other things in my match today . but the story of my life when i lose , people are shellshocked to see me play this way . if i win , it 's the best thing . there 's no doubt i 'm trying hard out there to make it work . sometimes it just does n't###happen . federer was bundled out of wimbledon by then 116th ranked ukrainian sergiy###stakhovsky , and his loss to another unheralded , if willing , opponent will place further doubts on his motivation and hopes to rebound in the twilight of his career . but the swiss master was having none of it . nothing goes past the hard work , he said . i 'll make sure i put the work in . i 'll believe in it and go after it . in some ways , as a player , you 're always excited about that prospect because there 's always something to look forward to , even in a big###disappointment like the match today .
washington the number of large###scale###projects to capture and bury carbon###dioxide has fallen to 65 from 75 over the last year , a worldwide survey has found , despite a consensus among scientists and engineers that such projects are essential to meet international goals for slowing the buildup of climate changing gases . the survey was released on thursday in seoul , south###korea , by the global ccs institute , which is based in canberra , australia . since a survey a year ago , five projects have been canceled , one reduced in size and seven postponed , while three have been added , the report said . the leader in capture and sequestration , as the technique is known , is the united###states , the report said , although that is mostly because of the use of carbon###dioxide for stimulating the flow of oil out of old wells . otherwise , the american program for capturing carbon###dioxide from power###plants is lagging . the international###energy###agency expects carbon###capture###and###storage to rank third among ways to reduce###carbon###emissions by , behind energy###efficiency and the use of renewable###sources like solar and wind###power , and ahead of nuclear###power and a switch to lower carbon fuels . the global ccs institute 's report , referring to carbon###capture and sequestration , found that while c.c.s . projects are progressing , the pace is well below the level required for c.c.s . to make a substantial contribution to climate###change###mitigation . gareth lloyd , the general###manager of corporate###affairs at the ccs institute , said at a news conference in seoul that despite the growth in renewable###energy , about 60 percent of energy in 2060 will still come from fossil###fuels , so c.c.s . is not an optional technology if we 're to address climate###change . capturing and burying carbon is a cheaper route to low###carbon energy than wind or solar###power , he said . policies are skewed strongly to renewables without much attention to what the lowest cost options are , he said . carbon###capture , though , has attracted opposition from people who oppose coal###mining , itself environmentally###damaging , and others who worry about injecting carbon###dioxide deep below the earth 's surface . among the problems , the report said , is a lack of support for projects that demonstrate new technologies . but it said that china , with 12 plants at various stages of planning and construction , was well positioned to influence the future###success of carbon###capture . china is now the leading producer of carbon###dioxide . carbon can be captured from electricity plants that burn coal or natural###gas , or from oil###refineries and other kinds of industrial plants . the dominant source , though , is coal###fired###power###plants , and last month the environmental###protection###agency proposed###rules to limit emissions from new coal plants and said it would also write regulations to reduce###emissions from existing###facilities . but the technology for capturing carbon has not been proved to work on a commercial###basis , either in the united###states or abroad . the energy department canceled its main project demonstrating the technology in . it would have turned coal into a mixture of gases and captured the carbon###dioxide before combustion . the department eventually started over with a plan to burn coal in pure###oxygen so the flue gases would be nearly pure carbon###dioxide , eliminating the task of separating it from other gases . that plan was aided by financing from the federal stimulus program , although construction has not begun . the institute 's new report said three american projects began###operating in , all based on natural###gas . one of them , the air###products steam methane reformer enhanced###oil###recovery project , in port###arthur , tex . , captures carbon from natural###gas that is used in an oil###refinery . the second , the coffeyville gasification plant , recovers carbon###dioxide from a fertilizer operation in southeast kansas a firm called chaparral energy compresses the gas and ships it 70 miles by pipeline to an oil###field . the third project is the lost cabin gas plant in central wyoming , where the gas is also used for oil recovery . brazil started up one carbon###capture plant , for use in an oil###field . carbon###capture experts say two important###projects will open soon in north###america the southern###company 's kemper county plant in mississippi , which will burn coal to make electricity and provide carbon###dioxide for oil recovery , and the boundary dam coal plant in saskatchewan , which will do the same . carbon###capture and sequestration was demonstrated at a coal burning power###plant in new haven , w . va . , built in 1980 and run by american###electric###power . but the utility shut down the carbon###capture equipment in 2011 because it could not sell the carbon###dioxide or recover the extra cost from its electricity customers , and the equipment consumed so much energy that , at full scale , the project would have sharply cut electricity production

washington despite years of differences on how to approach the terrorist###threat , obama administration officials said monday that the american authorities investigating the boston###marathon bombings were working effectively with their russian counterparts and that they hoped the experience would usher in a new era of cooperation on counterterrorism . since the bombings three weeks###ago , vladimir v . putin , the russian###president , and president###obama have spoken twice on the phone and pledged deeper cooperation . in a striking sign of collaboration on the investigation , russian intelligence officials have taken the extraordinary step of sharing secret transcripts of a phone call they intercepted in which they learned that tamerlan###tsarnaev had extremist beliefs , according to united###states law###enforcement officials . on the logistics and communications to facilitate what the f.b.i . is doing , we have seen a very cooperative russian government , because they understand we have a common interest in getting the full details in this investigation , said a senior united###states official . like other officials , he would not speak on the record about the continuing criminal investigation . relations between the countries have been strained over the sharply differing american and russian views on syria , whose embattled president , bashar###al###assad , has enjoyed support from moscow . just days before the marathon bombings , the obama administration banned two dozen russian officials from traveling to the united###states and froze any assets they had in the united###states in response to perceived human###rights###violations , notably the treatment of sergei l . magnitsky , a russian lawyer whose death in prison has been widely denounced in both countries . and the cooperation on boston stands in contrast to the experience of the united###states and russia in recent###years on other counterterrorism matters , in which collaboration has often been hampered by miscommunication , sluggish bureaucracies and mistrust between intelligence services , which have prevented extensive information###sharing . in , the russian authorities provided a warning to the f.b.i . and c.i.a . that mr . tsarnaev had changed###drastically , embraced radical###islam and planned to travel to russia to join underground groups . despite repeated###requests from the bureau for more information , however , none was provided . only after the bombings did russian officials inform the f.b.i . about the phone calls and provide the transcripts . because the 2011 warning concerned an ethnic chechen , american officials initially saw any possible threat as being directed at russia , which they said may have lent less urgency to the issue . by many accounts , the russian authorities kept close tabs on mr . tsarnaev when he spent six months in dagestan , and they knew he had been trying to meet with militants , but when he returned to the united###states , the russians sent no new warning to their american###counterparts . there was no message or implication that this was our problem , one senior american law enforcement official said . thomas de waal , an expert on the caucasus region at the carnegie###endowment###for###international###peace , said that in addition to recent strains , we 're talking about russian security###agencies that are the heirs of the k.g.b. , whose whole existence was predicated on suspicion of the u.s . he added , these are two of the world 's largest security bureaucracies , each with its own internal feuds among agencies . so it is unrealistic to expect them always to work seamlessly together against terrorism , he said . the differing###perspectives on the threat have been an obstacle to deeper cooperation . we 're focused on pakistan , yemen , somalia and the sahel they 're focused on the north###caucasus , one former american official said . a few chechens and others have made it into al###qaeda in south###asia , and we are always worried about the radicalizing churn in chechnya and dagestan . but there is not much basis for a deeper collaboration , because much of that churn is caused by russian human###rights###violations of the local###population . such views have long infuriated mr . putin , who considers the crushing of chechnya 's independence###movement in two wars since 1994 to be a victory over international###terrorism , not against a people seeking the right to self###determination . since mr . putin came to power , the united###states and many european###countries have granted###asylum to chechens who fled the wars . i have always felt outraged when our western partners , as well as your colleagues from the western media , referred to our terrorists who committed brutal , bloody , appalling crimes on the territory of our country as 'insurgents , ' mr . putin said in a televised town###hall###meeting on april , in which he was asked about cooperation after the boston bombings . they were hardly ever referred to as terrorists . they provided###assistance to them , information support , financial and political support sometimes directly and sometimes indirectly . referring to his counterparts in the west , he added we always said that they should n't make empty declarations that terrorism is a common###threat , but make real efforts and cooperate with each other more closely . but now these two criminals have provided the best possible proof that we were right .
the director robert stone likened his discovery of nuclear###power 's positive###potential to hearing the sex###pistols for the first time both opened worlds of possibility for him . it 's a challenging comparison , but not surprising coming from mr . stone , who is trying to upend beliefs and expectations with his documentary pandora 's promise . the film , which was released on wednesday , seeks to counter more than 40 years of sentiment against nuclear###power , some of which mr . stone , 54 , has been responsible for himself . his credits include the oscar nominated radio bikini , which examined the devastating###effect of nuclear###bomb testing in the pacific , and earth days , a 2009 documentary honoring environmentalism in the united###states . the criticism often heaped on documentaries , and the independent###film world that produces them , is that they preach to the choir . the few documentaries that speak to politically###conservative leaning audiences have had varying###degrees of success seeking a foothold on the festival circuit . pandora 's promise , for instance , stood out at the sundance and true###false film###festivals . on earth day this april , after driving from his home in rhinebeck , n.y. , mr . stone spent time in a meeting###room looking out on grand###army###plaza in brooklyn , reminiscing about how on the first earth day , in , he used his mother 's super 8 camera to make his first film , about the dawning of modern day environmental###consciousness . mr . stone 's long career has included nonfiction films on patty###hearst and the kennedy###assassination , as well as world###war###iii , a 1998 mockumentary he made for german television about a global nuclear###war . when earth days had its premiere at sundance , an audience###member asked mr . stone for his opinion on nuclear###power . he deferred to one of his subjects , stewart###brand , who is best known for creating the whole earth catalog and who had become an advocate for nuclear###energy . the place went nuts , mr . stone said . a hundred hands went up . i realized that this is the elephant in the room . first , mr . stone said , he got his head around the issue . convinced that global###warming is an imminent###danger and that wind and solar###power could never supply enough energy to power the planet , he researched nuclear###energy 's negatives and concluded that concerns about waste , terrorism and meltdowns were overblown . the conflation of nuclear###power with nuclear###weapons had helped###create a skepticism that is very broad but very shallow , mr . stone said . but how do you finance a film that 's going against the whole ethos of the documentary community ? he came up with a way to approach a wary congregation . the film should mirror my own journey , mr . stone said . the story of conversion is a classic tale . so pandora 's promise traces the emerging faith of several environmentalists in nuclear###energy 's promise . he cobbled together . 2 million from backers , particularly through impact partners , which provides documentary financing from individual###investors . mr . stone said the money came mainly from wealthy tech heads who have worked in silicon###valley . he was skeptical , he said , that sundance would accept his film . as andrew herwitz , the film 's sales###agent , put it , one assumes that the organizers have a very different point of view on nuclear###energy . he was referring indirectly to the festival 's founder , robert###redford , an ardent environmentalist . but the sundance director , john###cooper , said , we like films that create dialogue . asked whether mr . stone 's history he has had three previous###films at sundance was a factor , mr . cooper replied , the credibility of a filmmaker does matter to us . not all directors feel similarly embraced . mr . herwitz also represented u.n . me , in which the directors ami horowitz and matthew groff used satire to critique the united###nations . mr . horowitz , a former investment###banker , said he was disturbed by what he called the weirdness of the reaction that his film received from several festival programmers in the united###states , none of whom accepted u.n . me . he said that initial positive###responses turned###sour , and he accused sky sitney , the director of afi docs ( the annual maryland festival previously known as silverdocs , of referring to him as a bigot and a racist to mr . herwitz . both ms . sitney and mr . herwitz dispute the claim . it 's fine to curate based on quality , but to do so on ideology is a very dangerous road , mr . horowitz said . ms . sitney , in a telephone interview , responded , it 's an absolute lie , and added that 's shocking . i would never talk to anyone that way .
tim###tebow won all that in his football career . on saturday , he lost his third nfl job in 18 months . it might be hard to find another . the quarterback with two big###problems throwing the ball and reading defenses was cut by the new england patriots less than 12 weeks after they signed him and just five days before the season . but , as tebow sees it , this long journey is not over . i will remain in relentless###pursuit of continuing my lifelong###dream of being an nfl quarterback , he tweeted . coach###bill###belichick gave the player whose profile was higher than his production what may have been his last chance when he signed him june , the day the patriots' three day minicamp began . and tebow is grateful . he thanked belichick , offensive###coordinator josh###mcdaniels and owner robert###kraft , who said last tuesday he was rooting for tebow but would let belichick make the decision . in his tweet , tebow thanked the entire patriots organization for giving me the opportunity to be a part of such a classy organization . the patriots cut 12 other players and put safety adrian wilson on injured###reserve . that left them with 51 players , two below the regular###season limit they had to reach by 6 p.m . edt . but nfl . com analyst and former nfl executive gil brandt was n't surprised . he has had a great career and i think it 's probably time for him to admit that he just was n't right up to nfl standards , brandt said . i 'm sure that whatever he does in life he 'll be a huge###success . tebow was surely that at florida , where he won the heisman and two national###championships while surrounded by talented teammates . he was a success with denver , for one season , when he went 7 1 in his first eight starts in 2011 then threw an 80 yard touchdown pass to demaryius###thomas on the first play of overtime to give the broncos a 29 23 playoff###win over the pittsburgh###steelers . tebow knelt on one knee an expression of faith known as tebowing in the end###zone . but then a career of accomplishment descended into adversity . tebow led the broncos into foxborough the next weekend and lost 45 10 while completing barely a third of his passes . he was traded to the new york jets the following march and languished on the bench while coach rex###ryan ignored fans' calls for tebow to replace a struggling mark###sanchez . tebow threw just eight passes , ran only 32 times and was cut last april . for six weeks no team wanted him until the patriots signed him to a low###risk , two year contract with no guaranteed money . one person with knowledge of the deal told the associated press that tebow would make the veteran 's minimum###salary , 630 , 000 in , with incentives . at least he would n't be in the center ring of a media###circus that surrounded him in new york , not with belichick 's tight rein on players' interactions with reporters . if anyone could turn him into a good nfl quarterback , it seemed , it would be belichick . and mcdaniels was a booster of tebow , drafting him in the first round in 2010 as denver 's head###coach . there even was speculation that belichick might find other positions for the mobile tebow to play , but he worked out only with the quarterbacks . and his passes still bounced at receivers' feet and flew over their heads . we see things like the pass that he threw in overtime to thomas , brandt said . i think we see that every once in a while . it really gets us excited about the guy . i do n't know if he 's ever going to be a quarterback , and the reasons that i say that is that i think it 's very , very hard with somebody that does n't have real good accuracy ( and ) i do n't know if he has a real good feel for the game . now , barely two weeks after his 26th birthday , tebow 's nfl career may be over . i ca n't predict that , said john###fox , who took over as denver 's coach in 2011 and traded him after the season . i wish nothing but the best for him , as i 've said many times . he did a lot of good things for us , was great to this organization and to this coaching###staff , myself included . the patriots have carried just two quarterbacks in three of the past four seasons . so with ryan###mallett entrenched as the backup to tom###brady , tebow 's challenge was a difficult one , even before the preseason started . then he posted a quarterback###rating of just . 2 with two touchdown passes , two interceptions and seven sacks in three exhibition###games . tebow 's last play with the patriots , and perhaps in the nfl , was a 9 yard touchdown to rookie free###agent quentin sims with six seconds###left in a 28 20 win over the new york giants on thursday###night . with two scoring passes , it was the best of tebow 's three games during a shaky preseason in which he completed 11 of 30 passes for 145 yards and ran 16 times for 91 yards . it 's not just one game ( that matters , belichick said friday about the player evaluation###process , although every game is important . but the body of work , the camp , the rate of improvement , the ability to do the things that players are going to be asked to do at their respective###positions ( also matter . after his last game , tebow said he was n't sure it would be enough to keep him on the team . but he did n't plan to worry . he would go to sleep when i get home , wake up , come work out , watch the film , tebow said . see what i did good , see what i did bad , try to learn from it and get better . notes the patriots cut punter zoltan mesko after three solid seasons in favor of rookie ryan allen . they released three other veterans defensive###linemen jermaine cunningham and justin###francis and linebacker jeff tarpinian . also cut were defensive###lineman marcus forston , who spent last season on the patriots practice###squad , and seven rookie free###agents sims , linebacker ja'gared davis , defensive###backs kanorris davis , justin green , and stephon morris , offensive###lineman chris mcdonald and running back george winn . ap sports writer arnie stapleton in denver contributed to this report .
los###angeles when president###obama phoned the president of the a.f.l . c . i.o . last month , he shared some news that the labor leader had long wanted to hear the administration would propose measures to reduce workplace exposure to disease causing silica dust . but their conversation soon moved to what has become a contentious topic this summer labor 's renewed anger over mr . obama 's health###care law and decisions surrounding it , especially the postponement of an employer mandate to ensure coverage for workers and the potential effects of the coming health###insurance###exchanges on existing plans . according to officials briefed on the call , the president voiced concern about labor 's criticisms , prompting the union federation 's leader , richard###trumka , to promise that he would try to soften the harshly worded resolutions that several unions planned to push at this week 's a.f.l . c . i.o . convention in los###angeles . despite overtures on both sides with mr . obama agreeing on the call to sit down with some union leaders to address their concerns at the white###house , and mr . trumka initially hoping to quash such a public rift between the president and his party 's traditional allies labor leaders criticized the administration and congress on wednesday at their convention . while praising the overall legislation , the delegates overwhelmingly passed a sharply worded resolution that demanded changes to some of its regulations , although mr . trumka made sure to strip out some proposals that called for repealing the legislation . at the convention , though , several labor leaders spoke their minds . if the affordable###care###act is not fixed and it destroys the health and welfare funds that we have fought for and stand for , then i believe it needs to be repealed , said terence m . o'sullivan , president of the laborers' international###union###of###north###america . we do n't want it to be repealed . we want it to be fixed , fixed , fixed . we 've had our asses kicked on retirement security and we know our health funds are under siege , he added . we ask the president and congress to do the right thing for the men and women we represent . the resolution asserts that the law , by offering tax###credits to workers seeking insurance from for profit and other companies in the exchanges , will place some responsible employers at a competitive###disadvantage and destabilize the employment based health###care system . the administration and health officials have repeatedly tried to assure critics that the legislation will not encourage companies to dump workers from employer based plans into newly###created health###insurance###exchanges , even if the employer based coverage stands out as more generous and therefore more expensive for companies and even municipalities . at the convention , labor secretary thomas e . perez 's cautious response to questions about the leaders' concerns underscored how the complexities of the president 's signature domestic accomplishment and a longstanding goal of labor continue to present political difficulties for mr . obama . in his speech before a.f.l . c . i.o . members , mr . perez praised labor for helping enact the health law , but acknowledged that challenges remain . during an interview here , he said , the administration has been working to address questions and concerns###raised by a wide array of stakeholders . mr . trumka declined to offer details about his telephone conversation with mr . obama , except to say we 're trying to solve problems . he and a group of union leaders also met late last month at the white###house with denis###mcdonough , the chief of staff , and mr . perez . two other sessions have taken place since then with more junior administration officials , union officials said . the sit down with mr . obama himself , mr . trumka and the union presidents is set for friday . any erosion of health###care benefits poses a singular threat to labor leaders , whose arsenal of tools to attract workers into union membership has dwindled alongside the decline of their organizations and their concomitant loss of influence around the country . many unions and retirees have lost some benefits since the recession began , especially in the public###sector as governments froze pension plans .
trenton , n.j . yankees fan matt kowalski made the short trip to arm###hammer park , hoping to catch one more look at alex###rodriguez . kowalski got to see what he wanted rodriguez homered friday###night for the trenton###thunder , and many in the sellout###crowd cheered as the embattled new york star rounded the bases . i live 20 minutes away , and it could be the last chance to see him play , said kowalski , of mount###laurel . it 's kind of hard to not come out . i 'm afraid something 's pending . that 's the rumor , at least . major###league###baseball is set to suspend 14 players on monday in the biogenesis drug case , with rodriguez likely to get the stiffest penalty . the 38 year old third baseman has n't played in the majors this season while recovering from hip###surgery and a strained quadriceps . rodriguez left friday###night after five innings . he later said the yankees told him the tentative plan is for him to rejoin the big###league team in chicago for monday###night 's game against the white###sox . rodriguez said he 's confident that will happen unless i get hit by lightning , and these days you never know . i am mentally prepared to play for

the first inning , he hit a long two run homer in the third inning against reading lefty jesse biddle , a no . 1 draft###pick by the philadelphia###phillies in . rodriguez leisurely circled the bases to the cheers of the , 080 fans , many who applauded in admiration of the shot . the three time american###league mvp pointed to someone behind home###plate after touching it and headed to the dugout for congratulations by his temporary teammates . there were some boos during the night . i think there were a lot of phillies fans out there , he said . a lot of people cheered when i hit the home###run . in the fifth inning , rodriguez was called out on strikes . he talked to a couple of fans in the stands , signed a few autographs and gave away his bat , and exited the game . cheryl dacey of princeton junction sat behind a couple of philles fans who booed every time rodriguez came to the plate . she totally enjoyed seeing him quiet them up with his home###run . in my opinion , i 'm , i think a rod is one of the best players i will see in my lifetime for baseball , said the longtime yankees fan . i think there is a witch###hunt on for him . she got a chance to tell rodriguez that , too . she left the stadium after he was taken out with her no . 13 yankees uniform autographed . earlier in the game , rodriguez knocked down a hard grounder and threw the batter out at first by a half###step . prior to the game , rodriguez smiled a lot , met his teammates and shook###hands with coaches after stepping on the field at 13 p.m . he did not field questions from a massive media contingent before taking batting practice , throwing and fielding grounder in a 30 minute preparation for the game against the fightin###phils . this was rodriguez 's second appearance with the thunder this season , but the first one in new jersey . while there were a couple of a rod jerseys in the stands , there also were derek###jeter and mark###teixeira tops sprinkled in along with some from philadelphia players . the 30 year old kowalski wore a rodriguez uniform , and was somewhat forgiving when asked about a rod 's problems . it 's hard not to appreciate what a rod did for the yankees , he said . anyone who turns a blind###eye to 2009 is kidding themselves . they do n't###win a ring in 2009 without him , so it 's hard to forget that . thunder manager tony###franklin did not think rodriguez 's presence would be a distraction . our guys understand the circumstances around this , he said . it 's all about baseball for our guys . one thing about baseball players is when the game they have a unique###ability to separate what 's on the field from what 's off the field . it was hard not to notice rodriguez 's every step . cameramen and reporters stared at him , and they looked over his shoulder as he signed###autographs 20 minutes before the first pitch . i expect him to be productive in this lineup , franklin said of a player with 647 career###home###runs in the bigs . we 're in a pennant###race , and i say it jokingly , but i look for the same effort he always gives . he 's the consummate###professional when it comes to playing the game . the game means everything to him . franklin kidded rodriguez could keep up the tradition of stars buying food spreads for the minor###leaguers after the game . on a more serious note , he said rodriguez is a regular guy who can impart a lot to his players . he also wanted to see him in action . i love watching him play , franklin said . i am still a fan of baseball and watching him play on the baseball field is what i enjoy .
east###rutherford , n.j . maybe next time . maybe if russell###wilson can make it back to metlife###stadium in another month and a half for the annual orgy of excess known as the super###bowl , the weather will cooperate more and be less of a tease . by the time wilson led the seattle###seahawks' offense onto the field sunday###afternoon against the remains of the giants , the scant evidence of saturday 's snowstorm was wedged against the fences . the field was artificially green . the end###zones were fittingly ( and in relation to the giants' season , depressingly ) blue . the stands were manually and impressively cleared of snow . wilson is a quarterback who somehow never played , only practiced , in the white stuff at wisconsin , and he said he was let down by the vagaries of the northeast 's climate . yesterday , it was just coming down , something like eight inches , wilson said before the seahawks coasted to a 23 0 victory at the listless stadium that will host the super###bowl on feb . 2 . it would have been cool to play in the snow . stay###tuned . by winning the final road game on their schedule , the seahawks ( 12 2 ) improved the odds that the next flight they book out of seattle will be to the new york area . their playoff road to the super###bowl could be at home , where they are unbeaten . new york###city , jersey , whatever you call it , it 's a beautiful###place , wilson said . it 's even more welcoming when the home###team is offering so little resistance , failing to back up the tough talk about finishing a deflated season with professionalism and pride . it is difficult to do when your quarterback is intercepted five times tying a career###high 25 ( and counting ) for eli###manning and an opponent like wilson is finding every hole in your defense . wilson threw for 206 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 50 more while winning his 23rd game as a starter a record for a second year player in the super###bowl era . it would seem he is just getting going on the fast###track to greatness , as seahawks coach pete###carroll who is seldom at a loss for superlatives mentioned in his postgame address . so special , tremendous competitor , carroll said , just warming up . richard###sherman , the seahawks cornerback who weighed in with two interceptions , added he does it so casually , so smoothly , you almost forget that he 's a small guy . he 's , but he moves like a giant . metaphorically speaking , that is . the actual giants moved like an old station###wagon with bald tires in a snowbank , as they gained 25 rushing###yards half of wilson 's total . it is hard enough on a defense that wilson is so elusive he made one first half completion by dodging three tacklers who seemed to have a bead on him . but he also has an asset that many celebrated scramblers have not had the ability to see the whole field . carroll said he had not had to modify his offensive philosophy since wilson lit the sky over rainy seattle last season . we want that guy to be the point man , get everyone involved , he said of wilson in general . russell contributes to that because he 's so mobile . if he does make it back to metlife###stadium , would wilson really wish to leave his championship hopes to the capricious elements that would create treacherous footing ? he and the rest of the seahawks were not looking that far ahead because a ) football players are finely conditioned to talk about and take one game at a time and b ) who can possibly forecast the weather so far in advance ? some will no doubt be rooting for a storm like saturday 's to blanket north###jersey on super###bowl sunday and produce an event that would be uniquely memorable . others will wish for the same but only to give the n.f.l . the perfect excuse to tell chicago , denver and other frostbitten hopeful hosts to lose the league office 's number . i 'm a big believer that the game of football is played in all elements , commissioner roger###goodell said nearly two years###ago when the subject of this season 's super###bowl came up before the giants and new england met for the title in indianapolis . some of them are our classic games , were played in snow or ice or cold . we do have another side , which is they believe that when you get to the super###bowl , it should be played in conditions that are not impacted by weather . real fans like the morning tailgaters in the metlife parking###lot said they would have no trouble sitting through a snowy super###bowl . it 'd be great to have a game in the snow , said randy dedrick , 23 , of hyde###park , n.y. , a season###ticket###holder who has already spent a few thousand###dollars on two super###bowl tickets . it might be a problem traveling to the stadium , but i know i 'll be here . nearby , where the new york giants drumline was testing the eardrums of early arriving fans , john###jackson , of sleepy###hollow , n.y. , was standing behind a table lined with liquor bottles and food . i 'm not even a giants fan i 'm a buffalo fan , jackson , 42 , said . but a co worker of mine offered me a few tickets , and i said , 'give me the late season games . ' me , i love it when it gets cold . but let 's face it , we all know the season is over by the time they play the big###game , which is all about the media , the buildup and the people with the money who are coming in to party . the super###bowl is many things , depending on one 's point of view . to wilson , it would be the culmination of a quick###rise few saw coming . a championship game , a championship day , he said , describing the seahawks' goal . on the way out of metlife###stadium , hoping to return , the man who is more elusive than a snowflake said he would take whatever conditions come with it .
boston anibal sanchez was once a prospect blazing a path toward fenway###park , toward postseason glory , toward the spoils that eventually went to jon###lester , his teammate in 2005 on the class###aa portland###sea###dogs , a red###sox affiliate . they shared a rotation and visions of a bright future with the red###sox , rising in lock###step , but their paths ultimately diverged . sanchez was traded . lester was promoted . they had little in common beyond that summer in maine . their link was rejoined saturday###night , but lester now has a more ignominious recognition he was the losing###pitcher in a 1 0 win by sanchez and the detroit###tigers in game 1 of the american###league###championship###series , a pitching gem that very nearly made its way into the record###books . daniel###nava singled with one out in the ninth###inning to end the bid by five tigers pitchers to throw the third postseason no###hitter . but when it was finished , they struck out 17 red###sox , tying bob###gibson 's playoff###record from , and handed boston its first postseason shutout here since . fans blasted the umpires . frustrated players flung bats . but a 1 for 29 collective performance at the plate by boston simply echoed a trend of disappearing offense around the playoffs , with st . louis 's michael###wacha , detroit 's justin###verlander and now his teammates all flirting with pitching perfection in october . we got some big opportunities in that first , second and sixth###inning , red###sox manager john###farrell said . but that two out base hit was elusive . the game 's star was sanchez , who consummated his circuitous path back to fenway in a most unusual manner . his postseason line was unlike any before 6 innings###pitched , 6 walks , 12 strikeouts , 0 hits allowed . sanchez , with his fastball flaring into the mid 90s and a 90 mile per hour diving slider that turned devastating , rarely worked ahead in the count and battled with almost every boston hitter . keeping his pitch###count in check was a struggle from the outset , when he needed 51 pitches to work through two innings . he was pulled after 116 pitches . but nobody for the red###sox had a hit , nothing even close . only five batters even put a ball in play . the rest struck out or walked . he got rolling pretty good and made some good pitches , detroit manager jim###leyland said . he gave us all we needed . his 12th strikeout , against stephen###drew , came with the bases###loaded in the sixth and the tigers leading , 1 0 . the crowd was on its feet , but drew struck out on a 1 2 slider in the dirt , and sanchez did a pirouette off the mound in delight . i tried to get relaxed basically when i got bases###loaded , sanchez said . i tried to throw every pitch for a strike . at the end i struck him out . i got really excited at that point . the red###sox stormed through a four game series with the tampa###bay###rays with a diversified and resourceful offense , blending speed , power and the cocksure self belief of a 97 win playoff###team . but it all crumbled against sanchez the speed , the power , the belief . they showed frustration toward the home###plate###umpire , joe west . the leadoff###hitter jacoby###ellsbury , their postseason catalyst , went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts . sanchez looked dominating from the outset . in the first inning , he struck out four batters shane###victorino reached on a wild###pitch after a swinging strike three becoming the first player since orval overall in 1908 to do so in a postseason###game . in hitters' counts , he 'll throw a hard slider that starts in the zone and goes out , red###sox second baseman dustin###pedroia said . he knows how to pitch . pedroia would know he teamed with sanchez and lester on that class###aa portland team eight years###ago . after that season , sanchez was traded to the florida###marlins as part of the deal for josh###beckett and mike###lowell , who would help the red###sox win the 2007 world###title . it was a fruitful deal for boston , but they may not have fully envisioned sanchez 's eventual###success . at age , in his second season with detroit , sanchez led the american###league with a . 57 earned###run###average this year . he was roughed up by the oakland a 's in his first postseason###start , allowing six runs ( five earned ) in four and a third innings in a game 3 loss . but on saturday , he had no issues putting that performance behind him . i work on my mechanics during the off days , and i try to put it in the game , sanchez said . i tried to be on top of the ball for more movement . that 's what i do early in the season this year , and it worked today . in the fifth , the tigers ran into two outs on the base paths . after jhonny###peralta doubled to lead off the inning , he was caught drifting too far off second base on a sharp grounder to first . when mike###napoli adroitly fired to second , peralta could not scramble back in time . later omar###infante was thrown out at home on a ground###ball to third base . but the tigers finally###broke through against lester with a run in the sixth , on a two out , two strike bloop single to center by peralta , even as the crowd showered him with steroid chants , referring to peralta 's 50 game suspension for his role in the biogenesis investigation . i do n't try to pay###attention about what the fans are doing or whatever , peralta said . i try to do my job . it remained detroit 's advantage by the slimmest of margins until the ninth , when the red###sox anthem , shipping up to boston , blared and the closer , joaquin benoit , came in to try to complete the no hit bid . after mike###napoli struck out , nava battled with benoit in a seven pitch at bat that ultimately###ended with nava standing on first , the only boston base###runner who earned his way there with a hit . after a drew flyout , quintin berry , pinch running for nava , stole###second###base . but with the count full , benoit got xander bogaerts to pop out to short to end the game . the no###hitter had been lost . but not the win in game . the tigers added the left###handed reliever phil###coke to their american###league###championship###series roster , after he missed the divisional series with elbow trouble .
lead governor###cuomo told the federal###judge in the deadlocked yonkers desegregation dispute again yesterday that he stood###ready to help the judge enforce or modify his order for 800 new middle income housing###units . governor###cuomo told the federal###judge in the deadlocked yonkers desegregation dispute again yesterday that he stood###ready to help the judge enforce or modify his order for 800 new middle income housing###units . in the meantime , the acting city###manager expressed###hope for a compromise and said he would call for round the clock talks among city officials , opponents and proponents of the desegregation order , and representatives of the governor , senators daniel###patrick###moynihan and alfonse m . d'amato , and john cardinal o'connor . ''i think there is a possibility of negotiation , '' the acting city###manager , neil j . deluca , said in an interview . ''if housing has to be built , then it should be good for minorities and acceptable to white residents . the time to negotiate might be at hand . '' cuomo writes to judge governor###cuomo , in a letter to judge leonard b . sand of federal###district court in manhattan , said ''i repeat now my willingness to consider any request you wish to make with respect to helping you to enforce the law as it now stands or to modify if you choose . '' the letter , reiterating points made by mr . cuomo in a telephone conversation with judge sand on friday , offered no specific suggestions for enforcing or modifying his order or resolving the impasse . the yonkers city###council last week rejected the court 's housing plan and the judge imposed a rising scale of fines that could bankrupt the city within weeks . the tangled dispute , which dates back years , has prompted accusations of racism and is fraught with social , political and financial###difficulties for public officials and yonkers residents . the governor 's duty in that context , the offer of assistance by the governor appeared to be a delicate matter of balances . enforcing the law falls to mr . cuomo as the state 's highest elected###official . but the governor also has a duty to help resolve###disputes in the public interest . in his letter to the judge , mr . cuomo noted that he had ''already shared with you general approaches to modification of your order if you see fit to pursue that course . '' later , he said he had offered the judge no specific compromises , though he did discuss general alternatives . one such approach , reported friday , would be to scatter a larger###number of small###scale projects around the city . to help enforce the judge 's ruling , mr . cuomo noted that he had the authoritity to remove public officials who disobey court orders , but he said that approach would be lengthy , complex and perhaps impractical . ' 'removing officials does n't get you a housing plan , a resolution to the problem . even if you remove them , they appeal , it goes on forever , they run for election again , they get to be bigger heroes , '' he said in the interview . no comment by judge judge sand declined to comment on the governor 's letter , but noted that he would welcome any proposals that had the support of the citizens of yonkers and of the parties to the dispute . while judge sand refused to discuss any possible compromise , an official familiar with the judge 's ideas said the judge would be unwilling###to###accept any plan that involved substantial delays . in 1985 , judge sand found yonkers liable for 40 years of segregation in housing and education , and he ordered remedies . in 1986 , yonkers officials introduced a school integration plan , and later the city agreed to build 200 units of low income housing at seven sites . four city councilmen , a majority of the council , balked last week , however , at the judge 's order to provide###incentives to developers so that 20 percent of their housing over the next few years would produce 800 units for people who earn 15 , 000 to 35 , 000 a year . fines###levied , jail threatened for their refusal , judge sand imposed###fines of 500 a day and threatened jail###terms for each of the recalcitrant council members . he also imposed###fines that began at 100 last wednesday and , doubling each day , would rise higher than the city 's entire 337 million###budget within three weeks . yonkers , a city of 200 , 000 just north of the bronx , has recovered from financial chaos in recent###years only to face new fiscal disaster in the present dispute . a state financial###control board is to meet tuesday to devise a retrenchment of municipal###services to pay the fines . mr . deluca said he and mayor nicholas c . wasicsko planned to summon representatives of all sides to a conference###table . among those who would be urged to attend a conference , mr . deluca said , were save yonkers , a coalition of 42 civil groups that oppose the court 's plan canopy , a group of homeowners who favor the plan city officials , and other government and church officials . mr . deluca said that one of the four councilmen who voted against the plan was ''at least interested'' in attending .
st . louis matt###holliday was hit by a ball three times while he was in the batter 's box . he was sore from head to toe . of course , he did have a great###big smile on his face after another important victory for st . louis . holliday drove in a run for the seventh###consecutive game , helping joe###kelly and the cardinals beat the cincinnati###reds 6 1 on tuesday###night . st . louis won for the sixth time in seven games , including the first two of its three game series against third place cincinnati . the nl central leading cardinals moved 1 games ahead of pittsburgh , which lost to milwaukee , and 4 games up on the reds , who won the division last year . kelly ( 6 3 ) scattered eight hits and allowed one run in six innings . he also walked three but managed to improve to 6 0 since rejoining the starting###rotation on july . the 25 year old kelly has won each of his last three starts and five of his last six overall . he has a . 08 era in 34 2 3 innings this month . i made pitches when i had to and i enjoyed that , kelly said . my arm felt good . they got guys in scoring###position a couple times , i just tried to bear down and leave those guys out there . joe did a good job , he had great life again , matheny said . he just keeps making good starts for us . shin###soo###choo homered for the reds , who lost for the fourth time in five games . cincinnati 's last 13 batters went down in order in its third consecutive###loss to st . louis , making it 4 10 against the cardinals this year . the hot hitting holliday had a rough game at the plate , at least physically . he fouled two separate pitches off his foot and toe in different at bats . he also was plunked on the shoulder by a pitch from alfredo simon in the eighth . the last blow signaled the end of his day . but he went 2 for , including an rbi single against mat###latos in st . louis' two run first . he is batting . 346 with three homers and 10 rbis over his last seven games . holliday 's rbi string is tied for the second longest in the majors this season . arizona slugger paul###goldschmidt had an eight game rbi run in early###june . latos ( 13 5 ) gave up four runs and nine hits over six plus innings . he has dropped two of his last three starts . the cardinals went 4 for 11 with runners in scoring###position . that 's the type of team that we are , holliday said . holliday admitted that he was sore after the rough night . he even joked he would soon be wearing a catcher 's shin guard to the plate to prevent any further damage . the cardinals needed just 14 pitches to take a 2 0 lead . matt carpenter and carlos beltran began the first back to back singles . holliday then singled in carpenter , who scored his major###league leading 100th run . beltran scored when allen###craig bounced into a double###play . choo hit a leadoff drive in the fifth for his 100th career homer , but the cardinals answered with single runs in the sixth and seventh and scored twice in the eighth . craig pushed the lead to 3 1 with a run###scoring double in the sixth , giving him 96 rbis on the year . carpenter brought in jon###jay with a sacrifice###fly in the seventh . a loss is a loss , you 've just got to play better baseball , cincinnati manager dusty###baker said . there are a few things we 've still got to learn about playing winning baseball . baker was particularly upset with a baserunning error by zack cozart in the fourth###inning . cozart and jay###bruce ended up on third base at the same time after bruce was held while rounding third on a hit by latos . the play ended the inning . had cozart stopped at second and noticed bruce was being held up , the reds would have had the bases###loaded for choo . it 's my ( mistake ) definitely , cozart said . it was a bad play . you have to keep your head up . when i got to third i was surprised jay was even there . that was a big part of the game . baker was not in a forgiving mood . sometimes guys have got to be held###accountable for their actions , he said . they 're all big###boys , they 're all getting paid here . notes adam###wainwright , 2 . 58 era ) faces homer###bailey , 3 . 71 ) in the final of the three game series wednesday . bailey is 0 5 with a . 90 era in seven career###starts at busch###stadium . ... st . louis inf pete###kozma is mired in a 0 for 23 slump . ... the cardinals are 34 22 against nl central opponents this season with 22 divisional games remaining . ... the reds have spent the past 127 days in second , third or fourth###place . ... latos had two hits for his second multihit game of the season . ... the cardinals have doubled in a season high 18 consecutive###games .
( reuters ) ac###milan 's usually unflappable coach massimiliano###allegri has shown some rare signs of frustration over the constant speculation surrounding his future . with milan safely through to the champions###league###group###stage after wednesday 's 3 0 win over psv###eindhoven , allegri , who has clung on to the job for three years , complained of pontificating from the outside . for two years , there has been talk about the next coach of ac###milan . people have to be more objective , allegri , whose side host cagliari in serie a on sunday ( 1845 gmt , told touchline reporters after the eindhoven match . there is too much pontificating from the outside , there should be more respect for other people 's work . i 'm happy about the way the lads played but i 'm also a little angry , added allegri , referring to media speculation that he would be chopped if milan failed to make the champions###league###group###stage . people on the outside are trying to make me angry but it does n't work . allegri , initially a surprise appointment , won the serie a championship in his first season at milan followed by second place in . last season , however , was tougher as milan tried to balance the books and rebuild their team with younger players . they made an awful start to their campaign but recovered well in the second half , especially after mario balotelli joined from manchester###city , to finish third and clinch a place in the playoff . despite that , there was more talk of allegri 's departure during the summer , until he received the public backing of the curva sud ( south curve ) ultras , milan 's influential group of hardcore supporters . allegri even gave italian media a minor scare when he joked about quitting on wednesday . i 'll take the night to think about it , he told mediaset###premium . maybe , i will go to livorno by the sea , go out in a boat and just watch the odd match at san###siro . despite the 4 1 aggregate win over the dutch , milan badly need three points on sunday after beginning their campaign with a 2 1 defeat at promoted hellas###verona , where the defence showed the same frailties as last season . having spent most of last season playing###catch up , milan will not want a repeat this time , especially as they and napoli are seen as the only teams capable of launching any sort of challenge to the dominant juventus . champions for the last two seasons , juventus host lazio on sunday , just two weeks after thumping the coppa###italia holders 4 0 in the season opening supercup match . both teams won their opening league###games last week . napoli , who began with a convincing 3 0 over bologna , visit chievo ( saturday 1600 ) with striker gonzalo higuain looking for his first goal since his 37 million###euro move from real###madrid . higuain is expected to recover for the game following his boating accident on monday , when he slipped during an excursion to the island of capri and needed 10 stitches in a facial wound . germany forward mario gomez , who joined fiorentina from bayern###munich , will also want to get off the mark for his new side as they travel to genoa ( sunday , 1845 ) . fourth last season , fiorentina sold striker adem ljajic to roma on thursday , the second major departure following stevan jovetic . serie a debutants sassuolo will attempt to pick up their first ever top flight points at home to livorno ( sunday , promoted with them last season , and as roma 's host of new signings take on hellas###verona ( sunday .

until smoldering batteries forced safety regulators to ground boeing 's new 787 dreamliner jets last week , the aircraft###manufacturer was flying high , with soaring profits and a recently regained no . 1 ranking in jet deliveries over airbus . but the grounding , prompted by a battery fire on one jet and the emergency###landing of another , has knocked boeing off stride . now , investors as well as government officials are paying###close###attention to see how big the issue becomes for the company , which is one of the nation 's biggest exporters . although company officials said they expected to find a solution quickly , federal###regulators on sunday ruled out one simple###explanation that the battery was overcharged . if the problems prove more complicated , they could threaten boeing 's plans to expand production of the planes , and the jobs that go with them . boeing has a lot at stake , for its headlining airliner and for the company brand , said scott hamilton , the managing###director of the leeham company , an aviation consulting###firm in issaquah , wash . mr . hamilton said he had no doubt that boeing would work its way through this . but until more is known about the batteries , he said , it 's impossible to draw###conclusions about what went wrong , what the fix is , how long it will take and what the long###term###damage to the 787 and to the boeing brands will be . in what would seem to be the worst possible outcome right now , boeing might also have to redesign its powerful new lithium###ion###battery system , or even switch back to older , safer models . aviation experts said such changes could cost hundreds of millions###of###dollars and shave off some of the 20 percent savings in fuel costs that the new jets have delivered . analysts say boeing , which has about 80 billion a year in sales , has the financial muscle to weather the problems and make production of the next generation of airliners succeed in an industry familiar with outsize bets . but the recent###incidents were a reminder of the manufacturing and testing mishaps that had delayed the development of the planes . and any lengthy new delay could tax the patience of airlines and investors who thought the chicago based###company had put the problems behind it . boeing 's stock has dropped only . 4 percent , to . 04 a share , in the two weeks since the battery fire on a 787 parked at logan###international###airport in boston . the federal###aviation###administration grounded the jets after another 787 made an emergency###landing in japan on wednesday because of a smoke###alarm in the cockpit . the f.a.a . 's order applied to six united jets an additional 44 around the world have also been grounded . david e . strauss , an analyst at ubs , said big investors were cautiously###optimistic that the batteries just came from a bad manufacturing batch or could be fixed with minor changes . but , he said , if the f.a.a . came out tomorrow and said to redesign the battery , and boeing said it would take three months , the stock is going to go down on that . investors have been expecting that boeing would finally start freeing itself of the cash drain from all the problems in developing the plane and that they would start to see more rewards now , he added . the national###transportation###safety###board said sunday that it had ruled out excessive voltage as the cause of the battery fire on the 787 in boston , adding to the mystery of the cause . besides the hazards to passengers if fire or smoke escaped from the battery containers , the problems are important because the 787 relies more on electrical###systems than previous planes . its use of electric rather than hydraulic###systems is one of the innovations , along with more efficient###engines and a lightweight carbon composite structure , enabling the plane to save on fuel . boeing officials have said they had not previously had any problems with the batteries during . 3 million hours of flights by their test pilots and eight airlines . marc r . birtel , a boeing spokesman , said saturday that one lithium###ion###battery caught fire in 2006 during tests that boeing held with the f.a.a . but he said the problems stemmed from the way the test was set up , and not from the battery design .
thanks to decades of high###school reading assignments and a succession of big###budget movies , jay###gatsby , the socially insecure bootlegger created by f . scott###fitzgerald , has become the quasi official###emblem of america in the roaring###twenties . but a more appropriate personification of the decade and one who would have been far more familiar to those actually living through it might be the comedian harold###lloyd , whose life as well as his films reflected the shifting social###dynamics of that transformative era . even people who do n't know lloyd 's name will probably recognize the ubiquitous image of the young###man in horn###rimmed###glasses , hanging from the hands of a clock high above a city street . the scene is from lloyd 's 1923 feature safety###last ! , which is being reissued this week by the criterion###collection in a newly###restored and breathtakingly sharp blu###ray edition . the encounter with the clock is only one gag in the film 's meticulously constructed 20 minute climactic sequence , in which lloyd , as a lowly department###store clerk , finds himself forced to take the place of a professional human fly , whom lloyd has hired to climb the store 's skyscraper headquarters as a publicity###stunt . but even ( or perhaps , particularly ) when it is removed from its carefully motivated context , the image maintains its force and piquancy as a metaphor of urban anxiety modern###man uncertainly suspended over the chasm of an uncaring , impersonal metropolis , struggling to hold on to something , anything , as his feet churn the void and the minutes of his life click away . in safety###last ! , lloyd plays a small###town go getter ( identified in the opening###credits only as the boy ) who departs for the big###city in hope of finding the material success that will allow him to marry his sweetheart ( mildred###davis , as the girl . it was a move that millions of americans were to make during the decade , as the country continued its transformation from a self sustaining agrarian###society to a complex urban###culture of buying and selling . as a clerk at the de vore department###store , lloyd 's job is to sell bolts of fabric to middle###class women who are still accustomed to making clothes for themselves and their families . a sale provokes a near riot , and to restore order lloyd has to pick up a measuring stick and deploy it like a dueling sword ( a reference to lloyd 's box###office rival and great###influence douglas###fairbanks . this darwinian scrum must be escaped management offers the only way out , as well as the only opportunity to make enough money to support a wife . when lloyd hears an executive offer , 000 for an idea that will draw customers to the store , he offers the services of his roommate ( played by bill strother , the human fly whose performance inspired safety###last ! when lloyd happened to witness him climbing a building in downtown###los###angeles . harold phones his friend and offers him 500 to scale the 12 story###building , quite wonderfully expressing no hesitation whatsoever in carving off a 50 percent commission for himself exactly what an all american go getter would do . as it turns out , he more than earns it . when the appointed hour arrives ( 2 p.m. , exactly , as it needs to be in order to have the clock hands aligned for the moment of truth at 45 ) , bill is being pursued by a suspicious cop ( noah young , a lloyd regular and one of the great faces of silent comedy . harold has to climb the first story himself , and then the second and then on to the top , confronting a series of perils ( including pigeons , a mouse and a wooden###plank thrust out a window by a team of carpenters ) as he claws his way to the ultimate###goal , financial###stability and the home and family that comes with it . for lloyd himself , the climb was barely a metaphor . born in the tiny farming village of burchard , neb . , lloyd had arrived in california in , as full of ambition as the comic hero he would eventually create . beginning as a chaplin imitator under the name lonesome luke , lloyd passed through the broad slapstick tradition of early film comedy , slowly separating himself from the new medium 's large herd of mustached grotesques as he constructed his own naturalistic , psychologically rounded character . the horn###rimmed###glasses , which he did not wear off camera , became his trademark and the badge of his down to earth , boy next door appeal . the criterion edition of safety###last ! also contains three newly###restored short films take a chance , young###mr . jazz ( 1919 ) and his royal slyness ( 1920 ) that illustrate the stages of lloyd 's development , as well as the superb documentary harold###lloyd the third genius , produced by david gill and kevin###brownlow in .
minneapolis visibly refreshed and invigorated by their annual visit to the land of , 000 lakes and what often feels like as many wins the yankees completed their trip to target###field with predictable results thursday . they thrashed the minnesota###twins , 9 5 , and completed a four game sweep to spoil an otherwise beautiful independence day for the local###fans . but could those fans have expected anything different ? whether the twins play the yankees at home or away , under a dome or in the open###air , as favorites or underdogs , they usually find a way to lose . no matter that the yankees were mired in a dispiriting slump before arriving here , or that their lineup is a cheap facsimile of the star###studded version that has administered most of the disappointment to minnesotans . for the yankees , facing the twins has been their version of a visit to a spa , where they wash away their troubles and attain instant well being . come to minnesota , play the twins and pile up the wins . at target###field , which opened in , the yankees are 11 3 in the regular###season . but they have enjoyed###great###success against the twins regardless of the venue the old metrodome , the old yankee###stadium or either of the gleaming new stadiums the teams###play in now . the yankees have won six straight series against the twins since , seven of the last eight games and 30 of the last . that includes the playoffs , where the yankees crushed the twins' hopes in , 2004 , 2009 and . just seeing the yankees in the opposing dugout should be enough to make twins manager ron###gardenhire twitch and sweat , even if the yankees had won only 5 of their previous 18 games coming into the series , with a lineup that at times resembled a middling minor###league squad . i do n't know , gardenhire said . i wish we had answers for all that stuff . we do n't have answers for why these guys play so well here . even when derek###jeter , alex###rodriguez , curtis###granderson and mark###teixeira were nowhere to be seen , there was still robinson cano , who hit . 467 ( 7 for 15 ) with three home###runs , two doubles and nine runs batted in during the series even after going 0 for 4 on thursday . gardenhire seemed at such a loss thursday that he considered perhaps only half jokingly making architectural modifications the next time the yankees come to town . i know robinson cano talked about how much he likes to hit here , gardenhire said . maybe we should screw up our backdrop when he 's in town and slow him down a little bit . gardenhire assumed###command here in , and the twins won 94 games that year and the central###division###title . but he was swept in the six game season series with the yankees . gardenhire 's twins won four division titles in his first six years , but in the regular###season they were only 10 28 against the yankees and their manager at the time , joe###torre . gardenhire 's record against joe###girardi is 11 31 since girardi took over as manager in . in the playoffs , gardenhire was 2 6 against torre in 2003 and , and 0 6 against girardi in 2009 and . over all , including the playoffs , gardenhire 's record against the yankees is , for a . 245 winning###percentage this from a manager with a . 519 winning###percentage over all . justin###morneau hit###two###home###runs on thursday , and the twins still lost . joe###mauer has been playing against the yankees since , and he was hoping there would be a shift in the dynamic this year . he even has a . 353 batting###average against the yankees since , but it did not matter . the result , for him , was all too familiar . i 've been here for a while , so i know the history , mauer said . a lot of the guys that have not had success against the yankees are not here . it 's a whole new team and a whole new year . but to have this homestand happen , it 's not a good start . gardenhire is not the only twins manager to flail against the yankees . since cookie###lavagetto 's brief tenure in , the twins are 247 342 1 against the yankees . 419 ) . on thursday , the yankees turned the game into another laugher early , scoring three runs in the first inning , two more in the third and four in the sixth . after averaging fewer than three runs a game in baltimore , where the yankees were swept in three games by the orioles as their losing###streak stretched to five games , they scored 29 runs in the four games here . ichiro###suzuki and travis###hafner each had three hits , and vernon###wells , who was batting just . 228 coming into the game , had two hits and two runs batted in . the newcomer , shortstop luis cruz , had two hits and an r.b.i . they have great###players , gardenhire said , fusing the past with the present in one jumble of yankee domination . they 've always had great###players since i 've been over here . good players do good things . francisco###cervelli , the yankees catcher who is recovering from a broken right hand , sustained a stress reaction in his right elbow , the yankees announced . he will be shut down for two weeks and re evaluated .
denver the colorado###avalanche are rounding up the old crew to restore the downtrodden franchise . first , joe###sakic was given more responsibility in the front office . and now hall of fame goalie patrick###roy is rejoining the avs as head###coach . colorado reached an agreement in principle thursday with roy to lead the team and also serve as vice###president of hockey operations . roy will join###forces with sakic , who was recently###promoted to executive###vice###president of hockey operations . the avalanche won two stanley###cup titles with the duo on the ice and the organization is hoping they can help turn around a struggling franchise . pull this off and it just might be roy 's biggest save yet . the avs finished a year they 'd rather forget , winding up last in the western conference and sitting out of the playoffs for a third straight season . the dismal###season led to the dismissal of coach joe###sacco late last month . however , the team does have the no . 1 pick in the upcoming draft . they also have one of the winningest goalies of all time , a fiery competitor during his playing###days who will bring that sort of intensity to the bench . the 47 year old roy becomes the sixth coach in avalanche history and the 14th in franchise###history the team began as the quebec###nordiques and moved to denver before the 1995 96 season . the avs captured the first of two stanley###cup titles that season , with roy in net . although he has no nhl coaching###experience , roy did spend the last eight seasons as coach and general###manager of the quebec###remparts of the quebec###major###junior###hockey###league , winning the 2006 memorial###cup . he also is a part owner of the qmjhl franchise . this is an unbelievable day for me , roy said . it 's a new and exciting challenge that i am really looking forward to . almost 10 years to the day that i announced my retirement as a player i am back in denver and hope the fans are as excited as i am . roy 's younger###brother , stephane roy , let the secret out of the bag earlier this week , posting a facebook note saying his brother would be the new coach . that left fans in the mile high city eager all week , hoping two of the most beloved players in team history would team up again . this is a very exciting day for our fans and a significant###moment in our organization 's history , team president josh kroenke said . following the season , the avalanche shook up their front office , naming kroenke as their team president as he took over for longtime executive pierre lacroix , who was instrumental in assembling the squads that won championships in 1996 and . kroenke 's first task was giving sakic more of a say in every day hockey decisions . he also allowed sakic to seek out the next coach . naturally , he turned to someone he knows quite well . all along patrick was our top candidate and we are thrilled that he has decided to accept this offer , sakic said . patrick has a great hockey mind , is a tremendous coach and there is no one more passionate about this game . he will bring that winning attitude to our dressing###room to help this young team grow . roy was inducted into the hockey###hall###of###fame in . he retired with the most regular###season###wins in nhl history , since passed by new jersey 's martin###brodeur . roy also won two stanley###cups with montreal and remains the winningest goalie in stanley###cup history with 151 postseason victories . patrick 's passion for the game of hockey both as a player and as a coach defines who he is as a person , kroenke said . he is a winner and is coming back to denver , where he created numerous special moments on and off the ice while helping###lead us to two stanley###cup championships . roy won three vezina trophies , 1990 , 1992 ) and was selected to the nhl###all###star###team six times . the excitable roy started his career with montreal , winning two stanley###cup trophies for the canadiens . but a rift grew with the team after a game against detroit on dec . 2 , 1995 , when roy allowed nine goals before he was finally taken out in the second period . upset , roy told montreal it was his last game for the team . a few days later , he was in colorado , helping the avs win their first stanley###cup title . to this day , roy sweaters permeate the pepsi###center on game days . he 's that revered . roy had his number retired by the avs a decade###ago and a banner to commemorate the achievement now hangs from the arena 's rafters , alongside those of peter###forsberg , ray###bourque ( 77 ) and his new partner in turning around this franchise , sakic . the team has quite a bit to build around , too , especially since the avs have a young nucleus in place with matt###duchene , ryan o'reilly and captain gabriel###landeskog all under .
los###angeles it is an overwhelming chore to process all that the eyes can see in the bright , 30 , 000 square###foot warehouse that is home to the sports museum of los###angeles thousands of artifacts , including old uniforms , pieces of equipment , trophies , plaques , newspaper###clippings and photographs . not only is the collection huge , but it seems out of place . the items , primarily related to the brooklyn dodgers and the yankees , are being housed across the country from their ancestral home . but for gary cypres , who over the last 20 years built most of the collection bit by bit often bid by bid there is a bigger chore than grasping its size and location what to do with it all . cypres will turn 70 in october , and while there is something eternally youthful about collecting sports###memorabilia , it has not obscured the realization that he will not be around forever . so rather than one day leaving his wife and five children with the burden of dispersing his collection , cypres is looking for a good home for it . the reality has finally###caught up with me , he said . there is a realization when you get to my age that you 've sort of had your fun . but it 's very hard for collectors to sell . it 's like giving up a tangible piece of your life , especially when you have a collection like my dodger collection . when you take a piece here and a piece there , it destroys the continuity . but cypres may end up doing just that . the dodgers are not interested in taking the entire###collection , and he plans to see whether someplace in brooklyn , like barclays###center or the brooklyn###museum , would be interested in a long term###loan akin to those made to museums by private art###collectors . collections at the hall of fame , he said , are geared more toward individuals than to teams . the heart of his collection , which cypres estimates is worth more than 10 million , is from the period of 1947 to , baseball 's most vivid age in new york , the era of willie###mays , mickey###mantle and duke###snider . during those years , the dodgers and the yankees played each other six times in the world###series , the giants appeared in the series twice , jackie###robinson broke the color###barrier , and the dodgers and the giants played their last season in new york before moving###west . it was also when cypres came of age in the bronx , falling in love with the yankees and the game . he began###collecting baseball cards , though not always with great###care , putting them in the spokes of his bicycles . collecting remained only a hobby until . that 's when my economics changed , he said . cypres , whose corporate career had taken him to la###jolla , calif . , abruptly gained the means to invest heavily in his passion when the holding###company for which he was the chief###financial###officer was acquired in a merger . shortly after the los###angeles###riots in , cypres bought a burned out warehouse in an industrial area just south of downtown###los###angeles , unsure what he would do with the property but confident he had gotten a good deal . he rebuilt the warehouse , leasing parts to small###businesses and running some of his own start###ups there . but with the means to do so , he devoted himself to collecting and put the building to another use . i had two choices , said cypres , whose wife , kathi , collects contemporary###art . there was the rational , economic one , to keep renting it out , or the idiotic one , to house a collection . i made the little boy 's choice . the museum presentations are simple and well thought out , but the collection is so big that even in a two hour guided###tour , it is difficult to fully absorb the back stories of so many items . it 's funny , because what limits most collectors is space , cypres said . i 'm fortunate , or unfortunate , depending on one 's viewpoint . i 've often wondered , if i did n't have the space , would i be better off ? would i have collected more narrowly ? it 's an interesting###question , whether lack of room helps you in your collecting . cypres 's acquisitions include some contemporary###pieces , like barry###bonds 's 755th home###run ball , but it is the vein of dodgers and yankees memorabilia that runs deepest and richest . among the pieces are brooklyn 's 1889 acceptance letter into the national###league , the ball and the champagne###bottle from the 1913 christening of ebbets###field , dazzy###vance 's 1924 n.l . most valuable###player medallion ( there was no trophy then ) and three balls used in different games during joe###dimaggio 's 56 game hitting###streak . also on display are works by willard mullin , the cartoonist who popularized the brooklyn bum , the stubble faced embodiment of a team affectionately known as dem bums . the dodgers could have brought all this stuff west with them , but they did n't , cypres said , and it helps###explain why he was able to obtain so much of it . other than here , it 's nowhere , quite honestly . there are pieces , but nobody has assembled the history of the dodgers , particularly from 1890 to . the brand was n't created here . the brand was created in brooklyn when they played the yankees in all those world###series . cypres opened his collection to the public in 2008 but closed it after several months because of the expense of security and staff , and concerns about exposing the collection to too much light and traffic . he now opens the museum by appointment and for special events , like a premiere party this year for the robinson movie . cypres said the former dodgers owner frank###mccourt had expressed interest in housing the dodgers portion of the collection as part of a stadium redevelopment###plan . when mccourt sold the club , the new ownership###group told cypres it was interested in displaying only a few items . the dodgers' vice###president for planning and development , janet marie smith , and their president , stan###kasten , were not available for comment , a team spokesman said . so cypres will continue to look elsewhere for a home for the accumulation of history in which he has invested so much of his fortune and himself , hoping to find someone with the means and the belief in its significance and value . in the end , that would help validate the idea that it was more than a little boy 's choice all along .
( reuters ) everton have apologised to their fans for a controversial change to the club###crest and have promised a full consultation with a view to changing it again after next season . the english###premier###league club unveiled the new badge on saturday , redesigning the tower and , most controversially , removing the club 's latin motto 'nil satis nisi optimum' ( nothing but the best is good enough . within days more than , 500 fans had signed a petition to protest about the design and everton , who are searching for a new manager after the departure of david###moyes to manchester united , responded by apologising for a lack of consultation . we are sorry , the club said in a statement on their website ( www . everton . com . it is clear that you wanted to be involved in the selection of our new club###crest . we regret we did n't ask every evertonian about something that matters so much to every one of you . everton chief###executive robert elstone added our chairman had demanded widespread consultation and we stopped###short of that . we talked to our fans' forum , our commercial###partners and our experienced staff around the club . that was not enough . elstone said the merseyside club were already committed to keeping the new badge on the kit for the 2013 14 season but would take notice of feedback for a further redesign . everton , founded in 1878 and one of the 12 original football###league members , first incorporated the local prince###rupert 's tower , an 18th century bridwell or temporary jail , on their crest in , though it did not appear on the shirts until . ironically the new design , aimed at making the badge more modern and easily reproduced digitally , is a far more accurate###depiction of the squat stone tower , which had been elongated in previous###editions .
washington the senate###intelligence###committee on tuesday voted 12 to 3 to confirm john o . brennan as director of the central###intelligence###agency after the white###house agreed to provide more information on the legal###basis for targeted###killings of americans abroad who are believed to pose a terrorist###threat . the vote , in a closed committee meeting , showed that there was substantial bipartisan###support for mr . brennan , a 25 year c.i.a . veteran who has most recently been president###obama 's top counterterrorism adviser and has overseen the expansion of strikes by the c.i.a . and the military in pakistan , yemen and somalia . the three no votes were cast by republicans , including the vice###chairman , senator saxby###chambliss of georgia . four republicans voted in favor of confirmation . senator rand###paul , republican of kentucky , said he would filibuster the nomination after receiving a letter from attorney###general eric h . holder jr . that declined to rule out lethal drone###strikes in the united###states in extraordinary###circumstances like a catastrophic attack along the lines of pearl###harbor or sept . 11 , 2001 . but it appeared likely that the nomination would get the 60 votes required to end the filibuster , possibly as early as thursday . while mr . brennan , 57 , has been widely###expected to win confirmation , senators of both parties have used his nomination to try to pressure the white###house into disclosing information it has previously declined to give congress . they have had some success . on tuesday###morning , the committee 's democratic chairwoman , senator dianne###feinstein of california , said the white###house had agreed to give the committee access to all justice###department legal###opinions on the targeted###killing of americans . two such opinions were briefly shared with senators at the time of mr . brennan 's confirmation###hearing last month officials said the remaining two were made available on tuesday . but the administration withheld the opinions governing strikes targeting non americans that the committee has also sought , arguing that they are confidential legal advice to the president . as a result , the detailed legal###rules for a vast###majority of drone###strikes , including so called signature strikes aimed at suspected###militants whose names are unknown to the people targeting them , remain###secret even from the congressional intelligence committees . for their part , republicans have pressed for more details on the administration 's response to the terrorist attack in benghazi , libya , in september , which killed the american ambassador , j . christopher###stevens , and three other americans . the committee has been given additional benghazi material as well , though not enough to satisfy some republicans . in addition , a staff###member for each senator was also permitted to see the secret justice###department memorandums that govern the use of drones and other weapons to kill american###citizens identified as dangerous terrorists overseas . previously , only senators themselves had been allowed to read the memos , a restriction that ms . feinstein had strongly###protested , staff members said . but ms . feinstein complained after the vote that the committee still had not been allowed to retain the memos for study and reference . they brought them for review , and they took them away , she told###reporters . committee staff should be able to look at them and take notes . without a copy to refer to , she said , it 's easy to forget the particulars . three senators who had demanded all of the memos on killing americans ron###wyden of oregon and mark###udall of colorado , both democrats , and susan###collins of maine , a republican said they were pleased with the agreement and supported mr . brennan 's confirmation . we believe that this sets an important precedent for applying our american system of checks###and###balances to the challenges of 21 st century warfare , the three said in a statement . they said the next step should be to bring the american people into this debate and for congress to consider ways to ensure that the president 's sweeping authorities are subject to appropriate limitations , oversight and safeguards . in an interview , mr . wyden said i think this debate is just beginning . the nature of warfare has changed so dramatically . the rules with respect to targeted###killing , i think , do need to be made public .
virginia###water , england the golfing world must unite behind the new ban on the anchoring of putters from 2016 and avoid any unseemly legal###disputes , according to royal ancient ( r a ) chief###executive###peter dawson . the ban was announced by the game 's rule makers , the r a and the united###states###golf###association , on tuesday , and dawson has implored the rest of the sport to fall in line behind the regulation . the u.s . pga###tour and the pga of america , who both emphatically oppose the rule , said they were against the ban and are planning to evaluate their positions . whatever people 's views about anchored putting , they are made passionately with the best interests of the game at heart , dawson told a news conference at wentworth ahead of this week 's european###tour flagship event , the pga###championship . it 's true the best interests of the game would be served by this not being divisive , by people getting behind the decision the two governing###bodies have made and helping each other get to , when those who have had to make an adjustment to their game will have made that adjustment successfully . i have a great deal of faith in the essential goodwill of golfers everywhere and their willingness to get behind what the governing###bodies have decided , so i 'm very hopeful it wo n't come to anything like that ( legal###action . american keegan###bradley , the 2011 u.s . pga champion , is against the ban and has previously suggested he might consider going to the courts . players anchoring long putters have won four of the last six major championships , including australian adam scott at last month 's u.s . masters . opponents of the style have said it is not a true golf stroke and that stabilizing the putter against the body can give users an advantage to combat nerves . dawson said one of the reasons for the new rule was that youngsters are now being taught to adopt the anchoring approach . the increase in usage on tour and reports of youngsters coming into the game and starting out with the anchored stroke caused the subject to come into focus , he said . we have seen some tour events where 26 percent of players were anchoring and that the reports of college coaches and coaches of children coming into the game were proposing this method . it was a concern to us but this new rule will deal with that . if a player accidentally uses the anchored stroke from , he or she will incur a two stroke penalty for each occurrence in strokeplay and the loss of a hole in matchplay .
los###angeles cardinal roger m . mahony , who retired less than two years###ago as the leader of the nation 's largest roman###catholic archdiocese , was removed from all public###duties by his successor , archbishop jos h . gomez , as the church complied with a court order to release thousands of pages of internal###documents that show how the cardinal shielded priests who sexually###abused children . the documents , released as part of a record 660 million settlement in 2007 with the victims of abuse , are the strongest###evidence so far that top officials for years purposely tried to conceal abuse from law###enforcement officials . the files , which go from the 1940s to the present , are the latest in a series of revelations that suggest that the church continued to maneuver against law enforcement even after the extent of the abuse crisis emerged . auxiliary###bishop thomas curry , who was the vicar for clergy and one of the cardinal 's top deputies and his adviser on sexual###abuse , also stepped down as the regional bishop for santa###barbara , calif . the church had fought for years to keep the documents secret , and until this week it argued that the names of top church officials should be kept private . in letters###written in the 1980s , then father curry gave suggestions for how to stop the police from investigating priests who admitted that they had abused###children , like stopping the priests from seeing therapists who would be required to alert law enforcement about the abuse . both cardinal mahony and bishop curry have publicly###apologized in the past , but have said that they were na ve at the time about the effectiveness of treatment for abusers and the impact on victims . in a letter on thursday , archbishop gomez wrote that the files are brutal and painful reading . the behavior described in these files is terribly sad and evil , he said . there is no excuse , no explaining away what happened to these children . the priests involved had the duty to be their spiritual fathers , and they failed . we need to acknowledge that terrible failure today . cardinal mahony and bishop curry are still able to celebrate###mass and other religious duties . but cardinal mahony , a vocal advocate of immigrant rights , will no longer speak###publicly , as he has done frequently since his retirement in , a spokesman for the archdiocese said . archbishop gomez 's move to discipline his predecessor and to accept the resignation of bishop curry , was unexpected and unusual . it has not been the custom of bishops to use disciplinary###measures against one another or even to issue any public###criticism . instead , as part of the sweeping package of policies for dealing with sexual###abuse that american bishops passed at the height of the abuse###scandal in , the bishops agreed that they would employ what they call fraternal correction with one another when the situation requires . only the pope can decide to remove a bishop from the leadership of his diocese . and only the pope can defrock a priest or a bishop . advocates for abuse###victims had called for bishop curry 's removal last week , and had mixed###reactions on thursday to the actions taken by archbishop gomez . david clohessy , national###director of snap , the survivors network of those abused by priests , called bishop curry 's resignation a small###step in the right direction . but mr . clohessy said that the sanctions against cardinal mahony amounted to little more than hand slapping , and are a nearly meaningless gesture .
houston wendy davis , the texas state senator whose filibuster in june against an abortion bill backed by the state 's powerful republicans catapulted her to national political###prominence , has told supporters and potential###donors that she plans to announce next week that she will run for governor , according to democrats in texas and washington . ms . davis 's decision has the potential to turn the race to determine gov . rick###perry 's successor into a rare competitive showdown between long suffering texas democrats and the republican conservatives who have ruled state politics for decades . she would enter the race as a substantial underdog , but her candidacy would represent the most serious challenge to the republican lock on the office . two republicans , mr . perry and george w . bush , have held the office since the party began its winning###streak in governor 's races in , with mr . bush 's victory over the incumbent , ann w . richards . for weeks , ms . davis 's travels to washington , her speeches , meetings with potential supporters and public###statements have suggested her intentions . on her twitter feed on thursday she wrote a week from today , i 'm announcing something big . can you chip in now to show the strength of our grassroots network ? last week , she e mailed supporters , telling them that she would answer the question about her political future next thursday and that she was excited about what we can do together in the future . the democratic###governors###association , meanwhile , has been running a banner headline on its home###page reading wendy 's big###news . a spokesman for ms . davis said thursday only that she had made a decision , and that it would be revealed next week . matt angle , a longtime adviser to ms . davis and the director of the lone star project , a democratic policy group , said he was looking forward to her decision , adding , all of us believe that wendy deserves the right to make that announcement herself . until she makes that announcement there is no guarantee what her final decision will be . but , absent an official###announcement , people involved in republican and democratic politics said word had spread in austin of her intention to run and that some of the organizational planning and machinery for her campaign was already being put into place . her campaign would be based###in###fort###worth , a large portion of which she has represented in the state###senate . her announcement next week will take place in the fort worth suburb of haltom city , at the same coliseum where she received her high###school###diploma . ms . davis 's republican rival seems likely to be greg###abbott , the texas###attorney###general . he has raised more than 20 million and is tremendously popular among conservatives , many of whom support him for taking on the obama administration on legal fronts including federal environmental###regulations and the president 's health###care law . most independent political###analysts view mr . abbott as an almost unbeatable candidate , and the conventional###wisdom is that ms . davis 's campaign would be considered a success if she runs a close race in a state where republicans hold every state office . but some democrats say they are more optimistic . i think her chances are very good , said mark w . white jr . , a democratic governor from 1983 to 1987 who defeated a wealthy republican incumbent , william p . clements , in 1982 but lost to him four years later in a rematch . i compare it to my chances of winning when i decided to run for governor . everybody said it was impossible to do , and i was able to do it , and they 're probably telling her the same thing . she 's got the advantage that david had over goliath . ms . davis 's filibuster , which was watched online across the country , was an attempt to block the republican###controlled###legislature from passing some of the toughest restrictions on abortion in the country . the bill ultimately###passed , but her filibuster gave her and democrats a boost of momentum and cash . shortly before and after her filibuster , she received nearly 1 million in campaign###contributions in just two weeks , much of it from people who gave her 50 or less . political###analysts said that was small###change compared with the roughly 40 million she would need to raise to compete on a statewide level with mr . abbott , an ally of mr . perry 's . abbott is an intelligent and disciplined candidate who is very unlikely to commit the type of unforced catastrophic errors that could cause him to be defeated , said mark p . jones , a political###science professor at rice###university in houston . it would take a political miracle for wendy davis to win . republicans dominate texas politics . they control both chambers of the state legislature , and hold all statewide###elected offices . the last time a democrat was elected to statewide###office was nearly 19 years###ago , when attorney###general dan morales , lt . gov . bob###bullock and a handful of others won re election in . democrats running statewide in texas have lost by an average of 12 to 16 points for the better part of two decades , said calvin jillson , a political###science professor at southern###methodist###university in dallas . some democrats , however , note that for 105 years , from 1874 to , an unbroken string of democratic governors led the state . they and other analysts said that even if ms . davis were defeated , her campaign would lay the foundation for future wins and help revive the party , particularly as minorities grow as a share of the population . her entry into the race will be a shot in the arm for democratic morale , but will also likely inspire a counter reaction among the conservative wing of the republican###party , especially social###conservatives , who view davis through the prism of abortion politics , said james henson , director of the texas politics project at the university of texas at austin .
atlanta the most joy angel###mccoughtry derived from the 2012 season was not leading the w.n.b.a . in scoring or steering the atlanta###dream to the playoffs , but simply that it ended . she was suspended for two games and spent a week hidden in her home . she was convicted in the court of social###media when her coach was fired after a buildup of tension with her . at a playoff###game , she was jittery and scared , symptoms that she attributed to an anxiety attack . but that was last year when she was a restricted###free###agent , which by all accounts could have been her last with atlanta . the###dream had been her employer since the deposed coach marynell meadors , also the general###manager selected mccoughtry first over all in the 2009 draft . instead , mccoughtry is still wearing the###dream 's sky###blue , still scoring more than anyone else , still scowling at referees and glaring at teammates , though at a reduced level . part of the change stems from the###dream 's season , short circuited in the first round of the playoffs last year , extending this year to the finals . it 's been a lot more fun , a lot less stress , she said wednesday . i 'm just able to play , not worry about things . there was a lot of drama last year . the###dream , who trail the minnesota###lynx , 1 0 , in the best of five finals with game 2 on tuesday , had been stuck with the best and worst mccoughtry had to offer a prodigious , zealous player susceptible , by her own admission , to bouts of immaturity . jeff walz , her coach at louisville , showed mccoughtry video of her being overly irritated during games , especially at the officials . i always took it too far , she said . after indiana eliminated the###dream in last year 's playoffs , fever coach lin###dunn disclosed a damning plank of her strategy . the key thing with angel is , if we get her frustrated , then she kind of loses her composure , and i think it affects the rest of the team , dunn said . but the###dream front office knew who it had in mccoughtry , and there was no doubt she would be back . we are not looking for perfect people , kelly loeffler , a co owner of the###dream , said . we 're looking for players and coaches with their heads and hearts in the right place . with angel , we could see the maturity and the growth . we could see that happening through the ups###and###downs of last year . one of those downs came after that dismissal of meadors as the###dream 's coach . an accomplished college and professional coach for four decades , meadors was let go aug . 27 , 2012 , her 69th birthday . it was a move that hardly saddened mccoughtry i felt like i was n't respected by her , said mccoughtry , who was honored for her 2012 olympic gold###medal before one of meadors 's final games but was benched for the game because of an undisclosed disciplinary measure . mccoughtry denied any role in meadors 's firing , a claim supported by loeffler , who attributed the dismissal to a natural step in the team 's life###cycle . meadors could not be reached for comment . but that did not keep her from receiving some blame in social###media . even the connecticut women 's coach , geno###auriemma , weighed in , writing on his twitter page that team###owners had caved in because of an inmate in charge . mccoughtry , who had flourished on the united###states###olympic###team under auriemma , said she was hurt by that comment . i 've always had a great relationship with him , she said . the day after meadors 's firing , mccoughtry was suspended###indefinitely by fred###williams , a former assistant who took over for meadors as the coach and general###manager . the###dream did not disclose the reason for the suspension . mccoughtry accepted some blame , saying she had lost some of her motivation after returning to the###dream from the olympics . i was feeling so high after winning a gold###medal , then i hit such a low , she said , adding that she considered taking a break from basketball to pursue a new hobby , writing###music .
which state might get the thousands of coveted jobs producing boeing 's planned 777x airliner seemed up for grabs on thursday after boeing 's machinists in washington###state overwhelmingly rejected a contract extension that the company said was pivotal to future###production in the puget###sound area . boeing officials had promised to build the 777x in washington a move expected to add more than , 000 jobs if the machinists approved an eight year contract extension that would have safeguarded the company from strikes through . defying boeing , the machinists rejected the proposal by a vote of 67 percent to 33 percent , with many angry that it would freeze pensions and give them raises of only 1 percent every other year . shortly after the vote results were announced late wednesday , ray conner , the chief###executive of boeing 's commercial###aircraft division , said in a statement that the company would look at other locations to build the 777x , a new version of its fast selling . without the terms of this contract extension , we 're left with no choice but to open the process competitively and pursue all options for the 777x , mr . conner said . before the vote , the company floated the names of three other production sites it would consider huntsville , ala . long###beach , calif . and salt###lake###city . but some analysts said there were strong###reasons that boeing , in the end , would decide to keep production of the 777x in washington . richard aboulafia , an aerospace analyst with the teal group in fairfax . , va . , said the puget###sound area had clear advantages , including an excellent port , a skilled aerospace work force and longtime experience in building sophisticated aircraft . in terms of economics , it would make absolutely no sense to walk away from washington because of this rejection , mr . aboulafia said . but in terms of psychology , it 's hard to tell what boeing will do . scott hamilton , managing###director of the leeham company , an aviation consulting###firm in issaquah , wash . , said he was not surprised that the contract was voted down , saying boeing was trying to go too far too fast with its demands for concessions . he added that the machinists and boeing , despite the bad###blood , might resume bargaining . i think there is going to be great###pressure on boeing to return to the bargaining###table , certainly from governor inslee and , i would imagine , the whole washington congressional delegation , mr . hamilton said . minutes after the union announced the rejection of the deal , washington 's governor , jay###inslee , appeared before television cameras to say that he would continue###fighting for the project . it 's a decision that prevented us from winning this tonight , mr . inslee said . we could have won it tonight without anyone even getting in the front door . we are fully ready , able and willing to compete 100 percent to win this airplane , he added . on saturday , state###legislators in washington approved a law extending . 7 billion in tax###breaks to boeing through 2040 to help persuade it to locate 777x production in the puget###sound area . but for any deal to be reached , a rift will have to be healed with the many workers who were angry that boeing was pushing for a concession filled contract at a time when the company is on course to report record earnings this year and its stock hit a record high this month . moreover , many boeing workers were convinced that the company was bluffing in its threats to build the 777x elsewhere should workers reject the deal . many workers assert that washington###state has such an impressive work force and track record in building aircraft that boeing could not seriously consider building the 777x elsewhere even though boeing , upset with the machinists' swagger and strikes , opened a second production line for the 787 dreamliner in south###carolina in . maud daudon , the president of the seattle metropolitan chamber of commerce , said she took boeing at its word . i do n't think boeing was bluffing , she said . they 're under huge competitive###pressure . they need to move forward on the plane . many boeing workers had a host of objections to the proposed contract extension , which came in the middle of an existing###contract .
houston beyond the security gate at the johnson###space###center 's 1960s era campus here , inside a two story glass and concrete building with winding corridors , there is a floating laboratory . harold g . white , a physicist and advanced propulsion engineer at nasa , beckoned toward a table full of equipment there on a recent afternoon a laser , a camera , some small mirrors , a ring made of ceramic capacitors and a few other objects . he and other nasa engineers have been designing and redesigning these instruments , with the goal of using them to slightly warp the trajectory of a photon , changing the distance it travels in a certain area , and then observing the change with a device called an interferometer . so sensitive is their measuring###equipment that it was picking up myriad earthly vibrations , including people walking nearby . so they recently###moved into this lab , which floats atop a system of underground pneumatic piers , freeing it from seismic disturbances . the team is trying to determine whether faster###than###light###travel warp###drive might someday be possible . space has been expanding since the big###bang . 7 billion###years###ago , said dr . white , 43 , who runs the research project . and we know that when you look at some of the cosmology models , there were early###periods of the universe where there was explosive inflation , where two points would 've went receding away from each other at very rapid speeds . nature can do it , he said . so the question is , can we do it ? einstein famously postulated that , as dr . white put it , thou shalt not exceed the speed of light , essentially setting a galactic speed###limit . but in , a mexican physicist , miguel alcubierre , theorized that faster###than###light speeds were possible in a way that did not contradict einstein , though dr . alcubierre did not suggest anyone could actually construct the engine that could accomplish that . his theory involved harnessing the expansion and contraction of space itself . under dr . alcubierre 's hypothesis , a ship still could n't exceed light###speed in a local region of space . but a theoretical propulsion system he sketched out manipulated space time by generating a so called warp bubble that would expand space on one side of a spacecraft and contract it on another . in this way , the spaceship will be pushed away from the earth and pulled towards a distant star by space time itself , dr . alcubierre wrote . dr . white has likened it to stepping onto a moving###walkway at an airport . but dr . alcubierre 's paper was purely###theoretical , and suggested insurmountable hurdles . among other things , it depended on large###amounts of a little understood or observed type of exotic###matter that violates typical physical###laws . dr . white believes that advances he and others have made render warp###speed less implausible . among other things , he has redesigned the theoretical warp traveling spacecraft and in particular a ring around it that is key to its propulsion system in a way that he believes will greatly###reduce the energy requirements . he is quick to offer up his own caveats , however , saying his warp research is akin to a university science project that is just trying to prove that a microscopic warp bubble can be detected in a lab . we 're not bolting this to a spacecraft , he said of the warp technology . dr . white was an engineer with a background in the aerospace industry when he came to nasa in , starting his career at the agency by operating the arms of space###shuttles . he got his doctorate in physics from rice###university in , and now works on a range of projects aimed at taking nasa beyond the fiery rockets that have long characterized space travel . for nasa , dr . white 's warp###speed experiments represent a rounding error in its budget , with about , 000 spent on equipment in an agency that spends nearly 18 billion###annually . the agency is far more focused on more achievable projects building the next generation orion series spacecraft , working on the international###space###station and preparing for a planned future mission to capture an asteroid . but it has made internal resources available for the project and freed up other engineers to assist dr . white . it has also restored the pneumatic system in the laboratory dr . white is using , to allow it to float . the lab was once used to test equipment for apollo###missions and has control###panels underneath it that look like they belong in a fallout###shelter that time forgot . steve stich , the deputy###director of engineering at the johnson###space###center , said , you always have to be looking towards the future . he held up his iphone . forty years###ago , this was 'star###trek , ' captain###kirk talking on a communicator whenever he wanted to , he said . but today it exists because people made the battery technology that allows this device to exist , worked on the software technology , worked on the computational technology , the touch###screen . theoretically , a warp###drive could cut the travel time between stars from tens###of###thousands of years to weeks or months . but we should probably not book reservations anytime soon . my personal###opinion is that the idea is crazy for now , said edwin f . taylor , a former editor of the american###journal###of###physics and senior###research###scientist at m.i.t . check with me in a hundred years . but richard obousy , a physicist who is president of icarus interstellar , a nonprofit group composed of volunteers collaborating on starship design , said it is not airy fairy , pie in the sky .
athens , ga . with the rain falling and the score tied , north###texas seemed to have all the momentum . unfortunately for the mean green , they could n't###finish it off . surprisingly tied with no . 9 georgia early in the second half , north###texas was stifled the rest of the way . aaron###murray threw for 408 yards and three touchdowns , also scored on a sneak , and led the bulldogs to a 45 21 victory on a dreary saturday between the hedges . the mean green ( 2 2 ) scored twice on special teams , tying the game at 21 on a blocked###punt in the opening minute of the second half . the bulldogs dominated from there , finishing with a staggering edge in total###yards ( 641 245 ) though they did n't seal the victory until a short field###goal with just under 4 minutes remaining . we did a lot of positive###things , north###texas coach dan###mccarney said . but in the end , it was too much georgia and not enough of us . the mean green , off to its best start since , came in as a 33 point###underdog . they certainly did n't embarrass themselves , forcing georgia to go with its starters most of the way while collecting a hefty payout , 000 ) . i never got the sense of david vs . goliath with this game , mccarney said . we are moving in the right direction and georgia has been there . murray became only the second southeastern###conference quarterback with 100 career scoring passes . the three tds pushed his total to , trailing only 1996 heisman###trophy###winner danny###wuerffel of florida . i 'm sure he 's going to throw a few more for us this year , georgia offensive###coordinator mike bobo said . murray overcame an early interception in the end###zone , hooking up with freshman reggie davis on a 98 yard td the longest play from scrimmage in school history . arthur lynch and chris###conley also had touchdown catches for the bulldogs . north###texas' brelan chancellor returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown , and zac whitfield fell on a blocked###punt in the end###zone to tie it up . we thought we had all the momentum , kind of took the air out of the stadium , north###texas quarterback derek###thompson said . we were n't able to move the ball in the second half as well as we wanted to . murray made sure the bulldogs avoided the upset . he scored on a 1 yard dive to put georgia ahead to stay , then went to conley on a###4 yard td , the receiver showing great concentration after the ball was slightly tipped by a defender . we knew we would have a fight on our hands , murray said . we came out with the right mentality . no one was slacking . they just made some plays . darnell smith had north###texas' only non special teams score , hauling in thompson 's 20 yard pass . thompson threw for 202 yards , but north###texas had no running###game to balance things out . brandin byrd was the only player in positive###numbers , with 11 carries for 23 yards , and the mean green finished with just 7 yards on the ground . linebacker will wright made a big play for the mean green early on . when murray tied to force a pass into heavy coverage on second and goal from the north###texas , wright reached up to pick it off . murray bounced back on the next possession . he hooked up with jay rome on a 27 yard pass , north###texas cornerback james###jones was called for interference , and todd###gurley powered over from 12 yards out to give georgia a 7 0 lead . the bulldogs made it 14 0 on the first play of the second quarter from their own 2 yard###line . davis beat his man , hauled in the first reception of his career , and pulled away to beat the previous school record of 93 yards , which had been done three times including the famous touchdown pass from buck belue to lindsay scott against florida during the 1980 national###championship season . the teams###traded quick scores smith 's td was matched by murray 's 16 yarder to lynch before chancellor stunned the crowd on the ensuing###kickoff . one of the nation 's top returners , chancellor found a hole through a wall of blockers , easily slipped past kicker marshall morgan , and took off right down the middle of the field for a touchdown that cut georgia 's lead to . the mean green made it 21 all as the rain sent thousands of fans streaming for the exits . after a high snap , marcus trice broke through to block collin barber 's punt , and whitfield recovered for a tying td . we were pathetic on special teams last year , mccarney said . we are making up a lot of ground in that area .
los###angeles despite selling . 8 billion in tickets , universal 's fast###furious car racing###series is hollywood 's equivalent of a second###class###citizen . it does not dazzle with computerized special###effects like transformers or feature rising young###stars like the hunger###games . it lacks the cultural cachet of harry###potter . we feel like underdogs most of the time , said vin###diesel , who leads the fast###furious cast . what fast###furious does have and it has gone largely###unnoticed is an astounding online following . its facebook###page has . 9 million likes , more than any active film###series except avatar . mr . diesel has 39 million facebook fans among actors , only will smith has more . that kind of passion is making the next installment , fast###furious , one of the most anticipated movies of the summer . after an online promotional stunt coordinated by the studio to coincide with a super###bowl ad , fast###furious 6 is setting up one of the biggest###box###office races of the year mr . diesel and crew against the hangover part iii . both movies open over memorial###day###weekend , the last weekend in may , one of hollywood 's most important ticket selling periods . consider what fast###furious 6 stirred up on super###bowl sunday , feb . 3 . among six movies that were advertised during the game , it generated the biggest burst of attention by far , beating iron###man###3 and star###trek###into###darkness . in fact , fast###furious 6 received more mentions in social###media on that day than the other five films combined , according to fizziology , a data collection company . we measured the various ways audiences talked about these films online , and 'fast 6' blew everything else away , said ben carlson , fizziology 's president . since the super###bowl , fast###furious 6 has added about , 400 likes to the series 's facebook###page , more than any other advertised film the second biggest###success was disney and marvel 's iron###man , which has gained more than , 000 new facebook followers . the fast###furious 6 extended super###bowl ad has been viewed more than 16 million###times###on###youtube . the equivalent iron###man###3 spot has about 3 million views . universal won the marketing battle in part by having fast###furious 6 cast members promote the trailer on their social###networks as soon as it ran during the super###bowl . flipping every lever at one time is something we have never done before , said michael moses , universal 's co president for marketing . it was very coordinated to create as big and thundering a moment as possible . the sudden roar around fast###furious 6 reflects not only the unusual and overlooked strengths of the series , but also the value in hollywood of cultivating an online fan###base . universal was able to light its internet brush fire because it has spent###years working to make fans feel a sense of ownership in the series . we can tell when it 's just a studio publicist blasting out marketing materials , and they do n't do that to us , said umberto gonzalez , a contributor to the movie fan###site latino review . they involve the fans and listen to us . for instance , neal h . moritz , the franchise 's primary###producer , and justin###lin , who has directed four of the six movies , have included fans' cars in the films . mr . diesel said the casting of dwayne###johnson ( a k a the rock ) in fast five was inspired by fan feedback . if we take the time to listen , we will have a better movie , mr . diesel said . similarly , the return of a fan###favorite , michelle###rodriguez , in fast###furious 6 is the direct result of a fan campaign , mr . moses said . ms . rodriguez 's character , letty , appeared to die in fast###furious , the fourth###film . universal conducted an online###poll to ask what the sixth movie should be called and went with the winner . it also created a life on set instagram photo album during filming . rather than suppressing pictures , universal encouraged cast members to document the production with unofficial shots . most studios particularly warner###brothers and disney , with their layers of corporate gatekeepers try to prevent that type of exposure .
miami lawyers for a man scheduled to be executed in florida on feb . 26 for killing a state###trooper filed a motion in federal court on wednesday arguing that the prisoner had been wrongly denied his final appeal because of a missed filing###deadline . if paul augustus howell , 47 , is executed next week , he would become the first florida inmate to die by lethal###injection without receiving his final federal appeal , called a habeas###petition , since . that year , the united###states###supreme###court stated that a lawyer 's misconduct or gross###negligence may be enough to override the one year filing###deadline for final federal appeal under the antiterrorism and effective death###penalty act of . mr . howell 's lawyers say that his original trial###lawyer had a substantial conflict of interest , that began with a reported death###threat . an additional 30 florida inmates on death###row have also missed federal habeas###petition filing deadlines and could face similar###situations when their execution dates arrive . on tuesday , the florida###supreme###court rejected mr . howell 's appeal and his request for a stay of execution . the justices said they could not address claims that mr . howell may raise in federal court . michael ufferman , one of mr . howell 's new appellate lawyers , said executing someone before mr . howell , or any other offender , received a habeas review was not a precedent that rick###scott , the florida governor , should set . he has never had the opportunity to have this issue reviewed in federal court , mr . ufferman said . we are pushing that issue with the governor 's office . mr . howell was convicted in a 1992 pipe###bomb killing of a florida###state trooper , jimmy fulford . mr . fulford had stopped a car , later traced to mr . howell , that contained a microwave###oven with a pipe###bomb inside that mr . howell had made , prosecutors said . the bomb was meant for a woman with information on a south###florida drug ring . when mr . fulford tried to open the package , it exploded . but before mr . howell faced state murder charges for killing the trooper , he was a defendant in a federal trial for drug###trafficking in an unrelated case . his lawyer in the federal trial , frank sheffield , now a state court judge , withdrew from the case after his secretary , who was also his wife , said he received a death###threat by telephone . she said an anonymous caller asked if he could leave mr . sheffield a message if paul howell goes down , mr . sheffield is going down also . mr . howell was convicted on the drug charges and sentenced to life in prison . mr . sheffield decided to represent mr . howell in the murder###case , despite a request by prosecutors that he be removed from it . a state judge allowed mr . sheffield to continue to represent mr . howell . mr . howell 's appellate lawyers say that mr . sheffield 's continued representation posed a conflict , and is grounds for a habeas review . after mr . howell 's conviction , one of his court appointed lawyers missed a filing###deadline that would have allowed him to appear in federal court for this last appeal . the habeas review is routine in death###penalty cases , and provides inmates with a final layer of protection . in light of the supreme###court###case , they should reopen and reconsider the dismissal of mr . howell 's federal habeas###petition for being untimely , mr . ufferman said of his motion before the federal court in tallahassee . richard dieter , the executive###director at the death###penalty information center , which tracks executions around the country , said the 2008 supreme###court decision opened the door for cases like mr . howell 's . that 's a pretty glaring conflict of interest , mr . dieter said , calling it a reasonable claim . you have to wonder if there was even a basic representation , he added . the court 's ruling remains relatively untested , mr . dieter said , and the law is not yet well defined . the united###states###supreme###court is expected to hear a similar case out of texas next week .
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown , shakespeare wrote some 400 years###ago , and although crowns are far less abundant now , uneasy heads are everywhere on the world stage . so the audience for the new series the hollow crown should understand exactly what henry###iv###of###england means when he speaks that famous###line . that , at least , is the hope of the bbc and pbs , the co producers of the four part series , which was shown in britain last year and is to be broadcast on great###performances in the united###states , beginning on friday , sept . 20 . sam###mendes , the director who first pitched the series several years###ago and serves as one of its executive###producers , had the idea , he said , to do over the bbc shakespeares that had been done in the '70s , but this time to do them as real films , on locations and with large###numbers of extras , rather than as the weird hybrids they were then . ( those earlier productions were shot primarily on sets , with occasional awkward forays outdoors . ) the relatively action###packed history plays , he said , were very well suited to film , and doing them in that way for the small###screen was a concept whose time had come . we live in a world now where you could argue that long , series television is the state of the art of storytelling , he said . given the tradition of british actors taking on the great shakespearean roles , the stakes were high for the actors playing the broody 14th and 15th century monarchs in these ambitious productions of richard###ii , henry###iv , part , henry###iv , part 2 and henry v . speaking with the actors ben###whishaw as richard###ii , rory###kinnear as the young henry###iv , jeremy###irons as the older henry###iv and tom###hiddleston as henry v you feel the weight of their responsibility , and each has a strategy for dealing with it . when mr . irons tackles any part , he said , i like to feel i 'm a test###pilot , trying to see if this thing will fly . he paused . well , of course with shakespeare you know it flies , but i still try to forget that anyone else has ever played the role . mr . whishaw , stepping into a role that has been interpreted by , among others , john###gielgud , michael###redgrave , alec###guinness , paul###scofield , ian###mckellen , derek###jacobi , ralph###fiennes , fiona###shaw , kevin###spacey and mr . irons , relieves the pressure by reminding himself , philosophically , of t.s . eliot 's idea that with shakespeare we can never be right , but can only from time to time change our way of being wrong . mr . whishaw said , you 're never going to crack a role like this completely , and because there 's no way you 're going to be definitive , i just bring to it as much as i can of myself , at this point in my life . mr . hiddleston has perhaps the most conspicuous royal shoes to fill , thanks to the memorable film performances of henry v by laurence###olivier ( in 1944 ) and kenneth###branagh ( in . i knew that people would make comparisons , he said . but i knew , somehow , that i 'd find my own way . and mr . kinnear though he plays a character , henry###bolingbroke , who in seizing the crown from richard brazenly violates the custom of the divine right of kings chooses to see the tradition of shakespearean theater in his country as an advantage , not a burden . it has to do with a continuity that stretches back four centuries , and that 's something i always find quite moving when i 'm performing in one of the plays , he said . continuity is , of course , always a relative thing when it comes to making###movies . initially , mr . mendes said , i was very insistent that we rehearse them like plays , for five or six weeks before we started###shooting . to that end , he hired directors with extensive theatrical###experience rupert###goold for richard###ii , richard###eyre for the henry###iv plays and thea###sharrock for henry v . but mr . mendes went off to direct the bond film skyfall ( in which mr . whishaw and mr . kinnear both appear , and in the hurly burly of actual production , his rehearsal plan for the hollow crown did n't quite work out . according to mr . kinnear and mr . whishaw , there were two or three weeks of rehearsals for richard###ii , but for the three remaining plays , things got a little hectic . the series had the hard deadline of having to be shown as part of britain 's cultural olympiad last year . we spent a day or so working through all my scenes , about eight weeks before , mr . irons said . and mr . hiddleston wound up playing his role , as he put it , backwards , beginning with the courtship scene at the end of henry v and moving back through the battle of agincourt . at the end of 14 weeks of shooting , he said , i did all the stuff in the tavern , in which prince###hal of henry###iv , part 1 carouses with the fat old knight john falstaff ( simon###russell###beale . so i started out as the king of england and france , continued on as just the king of england and finished up as the prince of wales , he said , laughing . it 's as if i were shedding weight as i went along . the actors even managed to find some benefit in the rush and scramble of production . what i love about film , mr . whishaw said , is that you get these magical , spontaneous things that in theater you 're always trying to recapture or make happen again . one of the big tavern scenes in part 1 was , mr . hiddleston said , shot in a single take without ever having been rehearsed with the full company . the people in the tavern really did n't know what simon and i were going to do , so they just responded completely spontaneously , surprised , laughing , cheering us on . simon and i looked at each other afterwards and said , 'we 'd never get anything like that on the stage . ' these plays , mr . irons said , are about much more than monarchy . they 're called history plays , but they 're not history lessons , he said . they 're about people in a particular situation which is very difficult for them . certainly , the works come alive when the directors and especially the actors shed at least some of the burdens of tradition . richard###ii , perhaps the most eloquent of the sad kings in the hollow crown , really only comes into his own , in terms of his language , his poetry , after he 's been deposed , when he 's on the decline , mr . whishaw said . it allows his voice to soar , and he improvises these incredible riffs around transience and loss , all sorts of things . this new series tries to uphold the tradition of shakespeare by wearing it a little more easily than these monarchs wear their crowns , and the awareness of transience is what makes that possible . actors , like kings , come and go , one after the other , in their roles . for the actors in the hollow crown , if not for the kings they play , it 's an orderly succession .
galesburg , ill . in a week when he tried to focus attention on the struggles of the middle###class , president###obama said in an interview that he was worried that years of widening income###inequality and the lingering effects of the financial###crisis had frayed the country 's social###fabric and undermined americans' belief in opportunity . upward###mobility , mr . obama said in a 40 minute###interview with the new york times , was part and parcel of who we were as americans . and that 's what 's been eroding over the last , 30 years , well before the financial###crisis , he added . if we do n't do anything , then growth will be slower than it should be . unemployment will not go down as fast as it should . income###inequality will continue to rise , he said . that 's not a future that we should accept . a few days after the acquittal in the trayvon###martin case prompted him to speak about being a black man in america , mr . obama said the country 's struggle over race would not be eased until the political process in washington began addressing the fear of many people that financial###stability is unattainable . racial###tensions wo n't get better they may get worse , because people will feel as if they 've got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot , mr . obama said . if the economy is growing , everybody feels invested . everybody feels as if we 're rolling in the same direction . mr . obama , who this fall will choose a new chairman of the federal###reserve to share economic stewardship , expressed###confidence that the trends could be reversed with the right policies . the economy is far stronger than four years###ago , he said , yet many people who write to him still do not feel secure about their future , even as their current###situation recovers . that 's what people sense , he said . that 's why people are anxious . that 's why people are frustrated . during much of the interview , mr . obama was philosophical about historical and economic###forces that he said were tearing at communities across the country . he noted at one point that he has in the oval###office a framed copy of the original program from the march on washington for jobs and freedom 50 years###ago , when the rev . dr . martin###luther###king###jr . gave his i have a dream speech . he uses it , he said , to remind people that was a march for jobs and justice that there was a massive economic component to that . when you think about the coalition that brought about civil###rights , it was n't just folks who believed in racial###equality . it was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot . for decades after , mr . obama said , in places like galesburg people who wanted to find a job they could go get a job . they could go get it at the maytag plant , he said . they could go get it with the railroad . it might be hard work , it might be tough work , but they could buy a house with it . without a shift in washington to encourage growth over damaging austerity , he added , not only would the middle###class shrink , but in turn , contentious###issues like trade , climate###change and immigration could become harder to address . striking a feisty note at times , he vowed not to be cowed by his republican adversaries in congress and said he was willing to stretch the limits of his powers to change the direction of the debate in washington . i will seize any opportunity i can find to work with congress to strengthen the middle###class , improve their prospects , improve their security , mr . obama said . but he added , i 'm not just going to sit back if the only message from some of these folks is no on everything , and sit around and twiddle my thumbs for the next , 200 days . addressing for the first time one of his most anticipated decisions , mr . obama said he had narrowed his choice to succeed ben s . bernanke as chairman of the federal###reserve to some extraordinary candidates . with current fiscal###policy measurably slowing the recovery , many in business and finance have looked to the fed to continue its expansionary###monetary policies to offset the drag . mr . obama said he wanted someone who would not just work abstractly to keep inflation in check and ensure stability in the markets . the idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary americans getting better , he said . i want a fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say , let 's make sure that we 're growing the economy . the leading fed candidates are believed to be lawrence h . summers , mr . obama 's former white###house economic###adviser and president###bill###clinton 's treasury###secretary , and janet###yellen , the current fed vice###chairwoman and another former clinton official . the president said he would announce his choice over the next several months .
chicago of course , it was andrew shaw . the pesky little forward always gets up when he 's knocked down . the three overtime opener of the stanley###cup###finals came to a thrilling end at the stroke of midnight wednesday because the tenacious shaw is a whole lot more than his reputation for irritating opposing###players . shaw skated in front of the goal at the right time , deflecting dave###bolland 's tip into the net for the winning score in the chicago###blackhawks' 4 3 victory over the boston###bruins in the fifth longest###game in the history of the stanley###cup . we knew it was n't going to be pretty at that point , shaw said . you could tell both teams were physically exhausted . we 've preached it go to the net , you 'll find a way to get a greasy goal . we did a heck of a job of it there in the third overtime . shaw was knocked down near the boards but got up as the puck came out to michal rozsival , who started the winning sequence with a shot from the right point into traffic . bolland 's tip then went off shaw 's right leg and past tuukka###rask at 08 for his fifth goal of the playoffs . and just like that , the longest finals game in five years was over . shaw skated off to the side and pumped his arms furiously , then joined his teammates for a weary celebration . the bigger the stage , the bigger the challenge , he rises to the occasion , blackhawks coach joel###quenneville said . he knows where the front of net is . does n't have to be pretty . he 's a warrior . he 's one of those guys that you appreciate he 's on your side and he 's relentless . milan###lucic had two goals and an assist for the bruins , who had won five straight and nine of . patrice###bergeron scored a power###play###goal and david krejci finished with two assists . not disappointed in our effort , bruins coach claude julien said . there 's certain things you 're going to want to fix for next game . but as far as the game is concerned , it was a hard fought game . rask made an astounding 59 saves in a finals marathon that passed pittsburgh 's 4 3 win over detroit on june , 2008 , when petr sykora scored at 57 of the third overtime . game 2 is saturday###night at the united###center . that 's playoff hockey , bruins center rich###peverley said . it 's fun to watch , so we 'll think about this until we get out of here and then shake it off and get ready for saturday . the blackhawks won for the eighth time in nine games and improved to 10 1 at home in the playoffs . bolland and johnny oduya scored in the third period for chicago , which never would have made it to the third overtime if not for an impressive performance by goaltender corey###crawford . brandon###saad had his first goal of the playoffs . crawford gave the blackhawks a chance by standing his ground when the bruins had repeated opportunities in the extra sessions . shawn###thornton and daniel###paille skated in for a 2 on 1 in the first ot , and crawford turned away thornton on the doorstep . he denied peverley and tyler###seguin in rapid###succession , and helped chicago kill off two power plays when it was whistled twice for too many men on the ice . nathan###horton hit the post in the first extra session , and zdeno chara 's slap###shot deflected off jaromir###jagr and then the inside of the right post at the very end of the second overtime . it 's exhausting , said crawford , who had 29 of his 51 saves in the overtimes . i just try to tell myself to make the next save , and we 're going to score on our next shot . the action was so fast and furious that it took a toll on the players , with horton skating off during a power play with an injury likely a serious one to leave the ice during that pivotal###moment . the blackhawks trailed 3 1 in the third period before they turned up the pressure on rask , who stepped up when he faced a similar attack from pittsburgh in the eastern###conference###finals . this time , he coughed up the lead , hurt by one unlucky carom . first , bolland converted a nice pass from shaw for his first goal of the playoffs . then oduya 's long slap###shot went off the left skate of boston defenseman andrew###ference and into the net for the tying###goal with 46 remaining in regulation . oduya 's shot was going wide if it did n't hit ference 's skate . we were up two goals and all of a sudden the game was tied , said bruins defenseman zdeno chara , who had more than 45 minutes of ice time . we 've got two days to regroup and get ready for the next game . the sellout###crowd of , 110 cheered as krejci and chicago captain jonathan###toews stared each other down for the opening faceoff of the first stanley###cup###finals between original six franchises in 34 years . and it almost did n't###happen . game 1 came exactly five months after the official end of a long and bitter lockout . the labor dispute wiped out 510 games , but the sides managed to come together in time to save an abbreviated 48 game season and playoffs . they were rewarded with a final playoff###series between two big market teams with passionate followings and scores of top players . led by toews and a group of skilled forwards , the blackhawks returned to the stanley###cup###finals for the first time since they won it all three year ago . boston won the title the following season , and the same core of players is at the center of this year 's playoff###run . it was enough to attract the attention of president###barack###obama , who has a home in chicago and made it clear who he was pulling for before the opener . he wished the blackhawks good luck over twitter before adding hope to welcome you back to the white###house again as stanleycup champs . boston countered with a rolling###stone mick###jagger tweeted a picture of himself holding a bruins jersey before a show at td###garden . the bruins got off to fast###start behind lucic , who converted a nice pass from horton for the first goal of the series at 11 in the first . lucic set up his second goal with a little dirty work . he won the puck in a scrum along the boards , got a pass from krejci and fired it into the right side just 51 seconds into the second period , extending boston 's lead to 2 0 with his fifth goal of the playoffs . the two goal lead looked like a sure bet with rask in net , but the blackhawks found a way to get back into the game against the red###hot goaltender . marian hossa stole the puck from dennis###seidenberg in the boston end and fed saad , who one timed it past rask at 08 in the second . saad 's goal ended a scoreless###streak of 149 minutes and 36 seconds for rask dating to game 3 of the sweep against the penguins . that got the crowd going again , and the blackhawks drew a pair of penalties in rapid###succession to earn a 5 on 3 power play for 17 . with the prime opportunity to move into a tie , they passed the puck around too much and the bruins easily killed off both penalties . notes it was the first game between the teams since boston 's 3 2 shootout###victory on oct . 15 , 2011 . there were no games against teams from the other conference during the

tokyo ( reuters ) japan###airlines said a boeing 787 dreamliner jet undergoing checks in tokyo after a fuel###leak at logan###international###airport in boston last week had leaked fuel again during tests in japan on sunday . an open valve on the aircraft caused fuel to leak on sunday from a nozzle on the left###wing used to remove fuel , a company spokeswoman said . the jet is out of service after spilling about 40 gallons of fuel onto the airport taxiway in boston because of a separate valve related problem . in boston , a different valve on the plane opened , causing fuel to flow from the center tank to the left main tank . when that tank filled up , it overflowed into a surge tank and came out through a vent . the spill happened on tuesday as the plane was taxiing for takeoff on a flight to tokyo . it made the flight about four hours later . the causes of both incidents are unknown , the jal spokeswoman added . there is no timetable for the plane to return to service . we are aware of the event and are working with our customer , a boeing spokesman , marc birtel , said of the leak in tokyo . on friday , the united###states###government ordered a broad review of the boeing , citing###concern over a battery that caught fire last week , also on a jal plane in boston , and other problems . the government and boeing insisted the passenger###jet remained###safe to fly . the 787 represents the boldest bet boeing has made on a plane in more than a decade . because much of its financial###performance is riding on the , boeing is trying to double production to 10 jets a month this year to fulfill nearly 800 orders .

's to hold up the receivers so our front can get a little rush . but if you 're not getting any type of hands pressing on the receivers , then by the time we make a move on the offensive###linemen , the ball was thrown out of andy 's hand . there 's not much we can do about that up front . if the jets were tormented by dalton 's quick###release , then facing brees next does not bode well . brees has the highest completion###percentage in the league . 8 ) when spending at most . 5 seconds in the pocket , according to profootballfocus . com , and has yet to be sacked in 142 dropbacks in that situation . by contrast , geno###smith 's percentage of dropbacks when his time in the pocket is at least . 6 seconds is the highest in the league , 65 . 2 , as much a product of the jets' receivers' difficulties at gaining separation as his propensity for holding onto the ball too long . on sunday , smith threw###two###interceptions that were returned for touchdowns . smith revisited his performance monday with his position coach , david lee . they held their usual film study because they want to avoid another cancellation next week . jets receiver david nelson confirmed monday that bengals cornerback adam jones , apparently bothered by his physical style , made a threatening comment to him sunday but added that he did not take it seriously . i did n't take it anything further than that one play , nelson said . jones told nelson that he was going to find out where you live and come and get you , according to the daily news .

a secretive nonprofit group with ties to the billionaire conservative businessmen charles and david###koch admitted to improperly failing###to###disclose more than 15 million in contributions it funneled into state referendum battles in california , state officials there announced thursday . the group , the arizona based center to protect patient rights , is one of the largest political nonprofits in the country , serving as a conduit for tens###of###millions of dollars in political spending , much of it raised by the kochs and their political operation and spent by other nonprofits active in the 2010 and 2012 elections . the settlement , announced by attorney###general kamala d . harris of california and the fair political practices commission , which enforce california 's campaign###finance laws , includes one of the largest penalties ever assessed on a political group for failing###to###disclose donations . the center and another arizona group involved in the transactions , americans for responsible leadership , will pay a 1 million fine , while two california groups must turn over 15 million in contributions they received . together , the groups are part of an intricate , interlocking network of political nonprofits that have taken on a prominent###role in state and national###politics in recent###years , bolstered by legal and regulatory shifts , including the supreme###court 's citizens###united decision in . records and documents uncovered during the california investigation provide a rare###glimpse into how such groups closely coordinate transfers of money that mask the sources of the contributions and skirt state and federal disclosure rules . this case highlights the nationwide scourge of dark money nonprofit networks hiding the identities of their contributors , ann ravel , the commission 's chairwoman , said in a statement . last year , as california voters faced two major ballot###initiatives one , proposition , which would raise###taxes on the wealthy , and another , proposition , which would prohibit unions from using automatic payroll deductions to raise###money for political campaigns a republican consultant , anthony russo , began###raising money in connection with the two initiatives . some of the money went into political###action###committees in california , which are required to disclose their contributors . but roughly 29 million came from a group of 150 california donors who wished their contributions to remain###secret , among them the billionaire investor charles r . schwab and gene haas , a prominent###businessman and philanthropist . those contributions were directed to americans for job###security , a virginia based conservative group that is not required to disclose donors , to spend on issue advertisements . in september , with the election drawing near , americans for job###security concluded that california law might require disclosure of some of those contributions , and began transferring a total of . 6 million to the center to protect patient rights , which was founded by sean noble , a republican operative . mr . noble has worked###closely with koch founded political groups and been a featured speaker at the brothers' biannual donor conferences he also worked###closely with mr . russo to help draft the strategy in california . a donor working with mr . russo called and e mailed charles###koch several times early that october , according to an e mail obtained by investigators , seeking a contribution of several million for the effort and praising mr . noble . sean noble from your group has been immensely helpful in our efforts , the donor wrote . i look forward to seeing you on a golf course probably after the election . the center is not formally controlled by the kochs , and robert a . tappan , a koch spokesman , said neither brother ultimately contributed to the california effort . we did not support , either directly###or###indirectly , this ballot###initiative , which would have restricted public and private###sector employees' rights to contribute to candidates , mr . tappan said . california requires that the underlying sources of money behind significant political spending be disclosed . to skirt this regulation , when the virginia based group gave 25 million to the center to protect patient rights , it did not specifically earmark any of those funds for the california referendums . but the group made clear that it hoped the center would financially support the efforts in california to block the income###tax increase and blunt unions' political###power . the center obliged , transferring 25 million during the same period to two other groups americans for responsible leadership , in arizona , and the american future###fund , an iowa based conservative group with close###ties to the koch network . mr . russo told###investigators that the transfer was made with the understanding that some of the money would be used to assist two california organizations active in the referendum battles , the commission said thursday . proposition 30 passed , and proposition 32 was defeated . under the terms of the settlement , the center to protect patient rights acknowledged that it should have disclosed itself as the source of the donations to both of the california groups , the small###business action committee and the california future###fund for free###markets . the investigation into the center has already had repercussions within the koch political world , which is relying less on the center to transfer money to allied political groups , instead using a group controlled more directly by koch executives . malcolm segal , a lawyer for the center , said in a statement , the commission today recognized that c.p.p.r . acted in 'good faith' and that there was absolutely no intent to violate campaign reporting rules .
as the red###bulls trained at their stadium in harrison , n.j. , on wednesday , preparing to travel for thursday 's match at the colorado###rapids , the club admitted failure when it said it had parted###ways with its highest###profile acquisition of the off season . we will probably never know if it was age , lack of playing time , lack of interest or a dissatisfaction in the skill###level of his teammates and in major###league###soccer . but whatever the reason , the red###bulls and their brazilian midfielder juninho pernambucano , 38 , said they had mutually agreed to cancel his contract . we are very disappointed that juninho has decided to return to brazil because he is a great professional and a very talented footballer , andy###roxburgh , the club 's sporting###director , said in a statement . we wish him all of the best and thank him for his valuable###contributions during the first half of the 2013 m.l.s . campaign . the red###bulls believed they had received a deal last off season when they signed juninho , a free###kick###specialist , to a nondesignated player contract for , 000 from vasco###da###gama , the club with which he first forged his reputation as a playmaker and goal scorer from set###pieces . he continued his career in france with olympique###lyon . but juninho 's veteran skill was not a good fit in major###league###soccer , a rough###and###tumble league . in last sunday 's 2 0 home###win against houston , juninho dressed for the match but did not get off the bench . in the previous###week 's game , a 3 0 loss at philadelphia , juninho served a one game suspension for an accumulation of yellow###card points . over all this season , he appeared in 13 games , starting , and led the team with four assists . but he failed to convert on any dead###ball opportunities , even though the red###bulls said they had acquired him in part for those situations . in addition , juninho 's presence in the midfield seemed to crowd out tim###cahill and dax###mccarty . with juninho taking a back seat in the last month or so , cahill has emerged as the driving###force in the midfield for the red###bulls . last week , there were reports out of france saying that juninho planned to retire after the season . there had also been reports on twitter and other web###sites saying that he would soon leave the team , but red###bulls coach mike###petke brushed those aside . look , juninho 's 38 years old , so i 'm sure he 's thinking about his future , petke told the new york post . i know nothing . he has not stated to us , or has not said anything that i know of , about anything about his future . so i honestly have no comment on that , other than he is ready to roll this weekend and anxious to get out there . whether the club now feels compelled to acquire a third designated###player during this summer 's league transfer period remains to be seen .
berlin a report on doping in german sport since the 1950s , which media reports say contains allegations of systematic use of banned###substances , will be made public , the german###government said on monday . the report says west###germany organized and experimented with doping in sports in the 1970s and 1980s , much like its east###german neighbor , according to leaks in the media . the interior###ministry has a strong interest in a complete clarification and assessment of the history of doping , ministry spokesman philipp spauschus told a news conference on monday . the federal institute for sport sciences will today publish the researchers' final###report ... on its website and then the federal institute for sport sciences will do a specialist assessment and then there will also be a political assessment . the report , commissioned by the federal institute and prepared by berlin 's humboldt###university , was completed in april . its content had previously not been officially made public but some of it had filtered through the media . according to the sueddeutsche newspaper on saturday , the report says that by the 1970s at the latest west###germany was actively###involved in experimenting with performance###enhancing###drugs such as anabolic###steroids , testosterone and epo , financed by taxpayers' money . any substances seen as boosting performances were then deployed in many sports , it said . before and even after the two nations reunified in , east###germany was seen as a country that used state run doping at the height of the cold###war to amplify its position in the world through its successes in sport . west###germany , on the other hand , was never suspected of systematic state backed doping but rather seen as a country with individual doping###cases . the report also says banned###substances were given to minors in experiments to determine the effect of age on doping substances , according to media . spauschus said germany took the fight against doping very seriously . combating doping is , of course , primarily the sport industry 's responsibility but the german###government supports it to the extent that this falls within its responsibility and campaigns for clean sport that is free of manipulation and uses taxpayers' money for this purpose , he said . we support the national anti###doping###agency for example and are providing it with around . 5 million###euros in 2013 alone . we certainly take the issue very seriously and the federal###government primarily supports the fight against doping by providing###financial means .
( reuters ) four years###ago when the chicago###blackhawks won their last stanley###cup it seemed the only thing their precocious young captain jonathan###toews could not do was grow a proper playoff beard . toews finished those playoffs scoring###seven###goals and 29 points in 22 games , claiming a conn###smythe###trophy as the post###season 's most valuable###player and adding his name on the stanley###cup . back in the finals and ready to faceoff against the boston###bruins in game one of the best of seven series on wednesday , toews is sporting a much more impressive beard this time around but his scoring has not been nearly as striking . with one goal through the first three playoff###rounds , toews' point production may be spotty but his confidence and maturity have grown to the point where he does not obsess over it like he might have earlier in his career . when pucks were n't really going in and i did n't seem to be contributing the way i know i could , people can say whatever they want to say , toews told###reporters during the stanley###cup media day on tuesday . but i have n't let it bother me . i have n't let it hurt my confidence . i do n't think anything in my game has digressed the last couple of years , i think i have only gotten better . the easy###thing to notice is when you score###points but i feel like there are still a lot of good things in my game . while toews waits for his scoring###touch to return , the 25 year old canadian has found other ways to contribute to the chicago cause . he remains one of hockey 's hardest workers , leads all chicago forwards in ice time and is tops in faceoffs . the only goal that is on toews' mind these days is not the one he has n't scored but the team objective of winning another stanley###cup . we ( toews and team###mate patrick###kane ) have both gone through some moments in the playoffs where people are kind of looking at a lack of contribution , we 're not really too worried about it , said toews . we know there are a lot of good things we can do out there . the big reason why we are here is that we play so well as a team ... that 's the way it 's got to be and the way we are going to win this series as well . since chicago claimed toews with the third overall pick in the 2006 draft the forward has gone from strength to strength . in his first season he was a finalist for rookie of the year and in his second campaign he was made captain . nicknamed captain serious , toews has always been viewed as mature beyond his years , providing him with the perspective needed to wait out a scoring slump . i think you just get that experience and you understand that , hey , not everything is going to go your way , not everything is going to be seen the same way from different people , said chicago defenseman duncan###keith . i think he 's done a good job just keeping a###level head . that 's what makes him a great player . just , toews is already a member of the triple###gold###club limited to players with a stanley###cup and olympic and world###championship###titles on their resumes . he has twice played for canada at the world###championships winning###gold and silver and was golden again at the vancouver winter games , named to the olympic all star team . but it is the soft spoken toews' feisty determination and intensity that are seen as his greatest qualities , leading by example rather than words . in 2010 when we went all the way to stanley###cup###final we did n't really know how good our team was , recalled toews . we went out there and won games and the next thing you know we were winning the stanley###cup . coming back here we realize how tough it is , how rare this opportunity is because we worked so hard to get here .
thousand###oaks , california tiger###woods is in good position heading into sunday 's final round to clinch his sixth###victory at the northwestern###mutual world###challenge but he will keep a wary eye on zach###johnson , his closest###challenger . johnson has twice finished second to woods at the elite event hosted by the world number one , and he gave the 14 times major champion a battle###royale in 2011 when they dueled for supremacy down the stretch . woods ending up winning that year 's edition by a single shot , but needed birdies on the final two holes at sherwood country###club to keep the gritty johnson at bay . zach 's not going anywhere , woods told###reporters after maintaining a two stroke lead over fellow american johnson by shooting a###level par 72 in difficult scoring conditions in saturday 's third round . he 's consistent , he 's tough and he 's proven that he can win major championships , he said of the 2077 masters champion . so i knew that , and it was a great battle . woods had trailed johnson by a shot going into the final round of the 2011 world###challenge and went on to seal victory with a birdie birdie finish , draining a 15 footer at the 17th and a six footer at the last . i had an uphill right to left around 17 which i pulled in there , and on 18 that little downhill right to lefter , woods reflected of a win that ended a title drought of just over two years . i had n't won in a while , so not only to have won my tournament but also the way i did can it against the person i did it against . he 's just tough to beat . woods has always enjoyed competing at sherwood country###club and knows he is in prime###position heading into the final round . we 'll see what happens , the 14 times major champion smiled after both he and johnson had finished birdie par birdie on saturday . i 'm playing well right now , i think . i 've had , what , five wins and like four seconds here at this place . sherwood has certainly fit my eye , and i would love to win here . it would mean a lot to us at the ( tiger###woods ) foundation , and i 'm going to try and get it done and then move to my old home course next year . the world###challenge , which raises money for foundation projects and the six learning###centers woods has set up in the united###states , will be shifting to isleworth country###club outside orlando in florida next december . i 've###played hundreds of rounds there ( at isleworth ) and competed in the tavistock cup there a few times there as well , said florida resident woods . ( winning on sunday ) it would be special not just for myself but for the foundation and everyone who 's involved with us and what we 're trying to do .
the bears forced three first half turnovers and linebacker jonathan bostic returned an interception 51 yards for a touchdown , but the carolina###panthers spoiled marc###trestman 's nfl head###coaching debut by beating chicago 24 17 friday###night . the bears who had four turnovers picked up where they left off last season when they led the nfl with 44 takeaways and finished with nine defensive###touchdowns , one shy of the league###record . problem was chicago 's offense could n't do a thing for the better part of three quarters . carolina 's second year cornerback josh norman had two interceptions , including a 60 yard return for a touchdown against matt blanchard . the bears had three turnovers and allowed seven sacks . certainly we did n't do what we wanted or up to our expectations , trestman said of his offense . ... we 've got work to do . jay###cutler was intercepted on chicago 's first play from scrimmage by norman , setting up a 3 yard###touchdown###pass###from cam###newton to brandon###lafell . cutler bounced back to complete 6 of 8 passes for 56 yards , but the bears offense managed only a field###goal in the first three quarters . tight###end fendi onobun dropped a wide###open pass in the end###zone from josh###mccown in the second quarter and the bears turned the ball over on the next play at the carolina . matt###forte carried once and lost a yard and the bears were held to 16 yards###rushing on six carries and 85 total###yards in the first half . defensively , we just wanted to go out and establish ourselves , panthers linebacker thomas###davis said . we did n't really know what to expect because everything is new in chicago . so it was all about going out and executing what we do and we did a good job of that defensively . carolina 's third year pro played three series and was 3 of 6 for 16 yards with the one touchdown to lafell on a crossing route . but what had been a mostly positive night turned###sour when newton threw into double coverage and was intercepted near midfield by bostic , who ran untouched to the end###zone . newton did n't return to the game after that . cam got a little greedy and tried to force the ball in there , panthers coach ron###rivera said . newton said he asked coaches to put him back in for one more series after what he described as a disgusting throw . it 's something that you have to live with , newton said . you have to live and learn and it 's keeping me anxious for our next preseason###game . the panthers tried to emphasize their push toward a more traditional running###game , but struggled to move the ball with deangelo###williams held to 10 yards on five carries . with running###backs jonathan###stewart and mike###tolbert out with injuries , the panthers got a long look at their three young running###backs tauren poole , armond smith and sixth###round###pick kenjon###barner from oregon . barner scored on a 5 yard touchdown run late in the first half to give carolina a 14 10 lead at the break . that 's unacceptable , barner said of an earlier fumble in his nfl debut . i ca n't have that . in no way , shape or form can you win games with turnovers . i 've got to get that corrected . the panthers have been waiting three years for armanti###edwards to emerge and the former third round###pick is starting to show some flash as a potential no . 3 receiver . edwards , who has been praised by rivera for his play in training###camp , caught two passes for 38 yards . norman , entering his second season , started in the team 's nickel###defense and his interception of cutler set up carolina 's first touchdown . i 'm calmer this time around as opposed to my rookie year , norman said . cutler , who said the bears did n't do much in terms of game planning , called it an unfortunate start . i have to put the ball on alshon 's ( jeffery ) other shoulder , cutler said . we had some good stuff after that we had some bad stuff . typical preseason###game . the bears lost brian###urlacher to retirement and are starting two new linebackers in d.j . williams and former panther james###anderson . but it seemed as if they did n't###miss a beat early on , forcing three first half turnovers . there were a lot of things we could do better , bears linebacker lance###briggs said . there were some things we did well . when we put on the tape , we 'll all evaluate the things to improve on . all in all , when you are getting turnovers in the game that 's very big . notes prior to the game , the panthers held a moment of silence for jon###richardson , the son of panthers owner jerry###richardson , who died last month after a long battle with cancer . jon###richardson had worked in previous###years as the franchise 's director of stadium operations .
madrid twenty two law###firms will form a worldwide alliance to collaborate on financial litigation against questionable funds and other financial###products sold across borders in the wake of scandals like that of bernard l . madoff . the law###firms said the alliance was designed to reduce the dissonance in a world where financial###markets allow products to be sold###globally while litigation remains constrained by national###legislation . law###firms from the united###states , colombia , israel , macau , morocco , turkey and india , as well as from european###countries including spain , finland , britain , luxembourg and italy , will take part in the alliance . it will be headquartered in new york but run out of madrid , with javier cremades , chairman of cremades calvo###sotelo , a spanish law###firm , as its president . three years###ago , mr . cremades was involved in forming an alliance of about 60 law###firms that ended up reaching a settlement , on behalf of defrauded clients , with banks that sold mr . madoff 's funds . the alliance estimated at the time that three million investors worldwide had been affected by mr . madoff 's fraud , though there were just over , 900 active direct accounts shown in the madoff records available to investigators . the new alliance , named the international###network for financial litigation , is set to be introduced wednesday in new york . while increasing client referrals is also part of the group 's purpose , the main and initial###goal is to exchange information in order to improve and speed up coordination on international###litigation . glen devalerio , senior###partner of berman devalerio , an american law###firm that is part of the alliance , said in a statement we are convinced that coordinating the talent and efforts of litigant firms worldwide shall help to create a framework of international legal security , transparency and market confidence . as the euro debt crisis has deepened , the number of lawsuits for alleged corporate fraud or false###advertising in the financial###services sector has risen in europe , several of them instigated by retail investors who are claiming that banks aggressively marketed sophisticated financial###products that were much riskier than labeled at the time of their sale . mr . cremades said that one of the aims of the alliance was to put international pressure on national regulators in spain and elsewhere to harmonize the rules and make it easier for small investors to sue without facing huge legal bills . the alliance 's push comes as the concept of american style class###action has been gradually spreading across europe . this month , the french government announced that it would allow class###action###lawsuits against companies accused of being misleading and over charging for their services , in line with a pledge made by president###fran###ois###hollande during his election campaign last year .

before haim was haim , a rock###band made up of three sisters , its members este , danielle and alana , surnamed haim were three fifths of rockinhaim , a covers band made up of three sisters and their parents . playing in a family band really was the best lesson in songwriting , danielle said one afternoon last month . it taught us what classic###songs were , how they worked . the sisters were calling from los###angeles , where they live and were raised , and they were on their way to the doctor este at the wheel having finally become sick after a tumultuous summer on tour through europe . their doctor , for what it 's worth , is a distant###relative , too . in haim ( rhymes with rhyme , este , 27 , plays###bass danielle , 24 , plays###guitar and alana , the baby at , plays###guitar and keyboards . danielle sings lead , and the others harmonize .

gullane , scotland ten things to know about the british###open , to be played july 18 21 at muirfield . the course has hosted the tournament 15 times before , from 1892 to the fairest of them allmuirfield is considered the purest of the links course in the british###open rotation . blind shots are rare . nothing is hidden . the course forms two loops , with the front nine running clockwise around the perimeter , and an inner loop for the back nine that goes counterclockwise . this means golfers face wind from all directions . no other course that has hosted the british###open for a century features such a world###class list of champions . every winner after world###war###ii is in the world###golf###hall###of###fame . this will be the 16th open at muirfield . all but two champions alfred perry in 1935 and ted###ray in 1912 are in the hall of fame . for the first time since , the defending###champion is also the last player to win on the golf course . ernie###els won last year at royal lytham st . annes , and he won his first open at muirfield in . in 1994 at turnberry , the defending###champion was greg###norman , who had won his first open on the ailsa links . a major seems to be the one tournament tiger###woods ca n't###win these days . he is 0 for 16 in the majors since winning his 14th at the 2008 u.s . open . in the british###open , woods has only one top 10 in his last four appearances . now that augusta national has added two women as members , the debates shifts across the atlantic###ocean . the royal ancient golf###club has no female members , and muirfield is one of three courses on the british###open rotation that are all male clubs . the others are royal st . george 's and royal troon . adam scott was 32 when he won the masters for his first major . justin###rose was 32 when he won the u.s . open for his first major . if that 's a trend , it could be good news at the british###open for 32 year old players like brandt###snedeker or gonzalo fernandez castano . the return to muirfield is sure to bring back memories of saturday in , when a black cloud from the east brought cold###air , 40 mph wind and a driving###rain for just over two hours . among those caught in the storm was tiger###woods , whose bid for a grand###slam ended with an , his highest###score as a pro . colin###montgomerie shot , 20 shots higher than his second round . nick###faldo returns to play his last british###open at muirfield , where he won two of his three claret jugs . faldo won his first major in the 1987 british###open by making 18 pars in the final round . he won at muirfield in 1992 by blowing a four shot lead at the turn and finishing birdie par for a one shot victory . the british###open produced popular winners the last two years in ernie###els and darren###clarke . but golf 's oldest championship is the only major that has not produced a winner from the top 10 in the world over the last five years . in a year marked by a new rule ( anchored strokes ) and a broken rule ( tiger###woods' drop at the masters , the british###open is held at the home course of the honourable company of edinburgh golfers . this is believed to be the oldest golf organization , and the one responsible for creating 13 rules of golf for a competition in .
several years later , donald lutz recalls the scene with a mix of amusement and embarrassment . he was a camper at major###league###baseball 's international european academy in italy , and the other teenagers lined up to get the autograph of an instructor . lutz followed their lead , but he did not know why he should care about having rod###carew 's name on a baseball . he wrote 'h . o.f.' on it , and i had to ask my buddies , 'what is that for ? ' lutz said the other day , by phone from the cincinnati###reds' clubhouse . i did n't really have any knowledge of the history of the game . i 've had to google so much . a quick search could tell lutz that h.o.f . stands for hall of fame , the highest###honor###bestowed in the major###league ballplayer fraternity to which he now belongs . lutz , a 24 year old outfielder , is a long way from cooperstown , but last month , he became the first player developed in germany to reach the majors . lutz 's father , donald sr . , was an american###serviceman stationed in friedberg , germany . he met lutz 's mother , marlen , and moved to the united###states , where donald jr . , their third child , was born in . the parents###divorced , and marlen and the children moved home to friedberg when donald jr . was 8 months old . lutz grew up with little curiosity about the pastime of the country of his birth . he was more interested in ice###hockey and handball , and discovered baseball only at the urging of his older###brother , sascha , who encouraged him to try it at . everything was tough because i had never watched any major###league###baseball , lutz said . the game goes quick i had to learn how to throw a ball straight , how to field , how to catch and not be scared of the ball . but i picked it up real quick . lutz said he almost gave up baseball just after starting to play . he first tried to hit right handed , which felt awkward , before switching to the other side of the plate . he handled a hockey###stick left handed , and felt the same comfort holding a baseball###bat that way . i started crushing the ball , lutz said . it was so much fun seeing the ball come off my bat . lutz 's talent earned him a spot at the european academy , and the reds signed him in . he is the second graduate of the academy to reach the majors , after italy 's alex liddi , who made his debut for the seattle###mariners in . lutz started last season in rookie ball and finished in class###aa , hitting 22 home###runs over all and batting . 269 . he was promoted to the reds from class###aa in late###april . forty one major###leaguers have been born in germany , including outfielder jeff###baker of the texas###rangers and starter edwin###jackson of the chicago###cubs . but m.l.b . said previous major###leaguers born in germany were children of american military###personnel stationed there . that makes lutz , who is 9 for 31 with a home###run , a focal###point for attention back home . he said he could not go onto his facebook###page anymore and often has to turn off his phone , but embraces his role as a pioneer , of sorts . there 's no pressure at all , lutz said . i 'm enjoying every moment of it . it 's been amazing , the way you get treated , but i feel like the games are the same just more people watching . mark###melancon broke into the majors with the yankees in , when the team was on its way to a title and the bullpen , of course , was anchored by mariano###rivera . the yankees thought melancon had a chance to maybe , someday , succeed rivera as the closer . under the circumstances , it was only natural that melancon would look up to rivera . but after a disappointing###season for the boston###red###sox last year , melancon said he learned that what works for rivera could not work for him . i needed to change my mentality , melancon said last week before his pittsburgh###pirates played in new york . i think i was too laid back . watching mariano , he 's a guy that i wanted to emulate , and he 's just so laid back , so smooth , so calm . i wanted that approach , and from the outside looking in , i still want it to look that way . but from the inside , i needed that fire , that fuel , a little bit more . the red###sox acquired melancon from houston before last season , hoping he could be their primary setup###man . but he had a . 20 earned###run###average in 41 games , including one in which he allowed six runs , three on homers , without an out . late in the season , though , as the red###sox staggered to the finish , melancon improved . he held opponents to a . 207 average over the final two months , and the pirates traded closer joel###hanrahan who underwent reconstructive elbow surgery thursday to acquire melancon and three others in december . this season , melancon said , he has subtly altered his delivery , changing the way he sets his hands and lifts his left###leg . he also credited his catchers for helping produce a sparkling early pitching line 22 innings , 2 runs , 17 hits , 1 walk and 22 strikeouts . who would n't like those numbers ? manager clint###hurdle said . they 're about as good as you can get . he throws a lot of first pitch strikes . the cutter 's been in play , big time . the velocity of his fastball has been firm and established , his command has been really good , and the breaking###ball has flat out challenged people . so with the command of three pitches and all of them are above average right now he 's been very effective . melancon did not learn the cutter from rivera he picked it up in houston , where the yankees sent him at the 2010 trading###deadline for lance###berkman . it was the first of three trades for melancon in three years . i 'm trying to meet everybody in baseball , said melancon , who smiled . it seems , at last , that he has found a home for a while . the yankees visit baltimore this week for the first time since last october 's division###series , which the yankees won in five exhausting games . they will meet the ever improving orioles third baseman manny###machado , who does not turn 21 until july and is second in the majors in hits , with . if machado keeps up the pace , he would join a small###group of players to lead their league in hits at age 21 or younger . only three others have done it the hall of famers ty###cobb ( 1907 ) and al###kaline , both of the detroit###tigers , and the current chicago###cubs shortstop starlin###castro , who did it in .

boston chicago###blackhawks captain jonathan###toews is what coaches like to call a complete ice###hockey###player . defensively responsible , hard working , a leader and a playmaker , toews has been all these things but mostly he is a goal scorer . on wednesday he did what the blackhawks expect him to do and scored a second period goal against the boston###bruins in a 6 5 overtime win that leveled the stanley###cup###final at . toews' was not the most important goal of the night but it could have been the most significant if it signals the long###awaited end to a dismal postseason scoring slump that was growing more and more worrying with each goal less game . when chicago won their last stanley###cup in , toews finished with seven goals and 29 points in 22 games and earned the conn###smythe###trophy as the postseason 's most valuable###player . these playoffs , toews , who tied for the team lead in goals###scored during the regular###season with , had counted just one goal , against the detroit###red###wings in the western conference###semi###finals , before wednesday 's game four . i think it makes a world of difference for you when you finally see one go in , toews told###reporters . you work hard , eventually you 're going to find a way . tonight was one of those games , we treated it as a game seven . we were n't going to be denied and i felt that same way , too . it 's time to put all those other games behind us , the games where we struggled to score , forget about it , just find a way to do what you do . blackhawks coach joel###quenneville defended his captain , pointing out at great###length the many different ways that toews had been contributing to the chicago cause logging heavy minutes , taking extra care of his defensive responsibilities , winning faceoffs . for his work without the puck , toews last week was awarded the frank selke###trophy that goes to the nhl forward who best excels in the defensive aspects of the game . but with his team struggling to score against the bruins , quenneville needed his sniper to start finding the target again . in an effort to jumpstart toews , quenneville reunited him with chicago 's other top forward , patrick###kane , and along with bryan bickell the line produced some magic . kane also scored his first goal of the final on wednesday and the trio were also on the ice for brent###seabrook 's overtime###winner , kane and bickell picking up assists while toews was parked on the goalmouth ready to scoop up any rebounds . few in the td###garden were happier to see toews find the back of the net than quenneville . johnny had the puck more today , i thought he was more friendly with it , said quenneville . that line was dangerous , be it off the rush or in the zone . obviously scoring has got to help him . the excitement of that line , kaner in possession , bick around with the big body , they scored some different kind of goals .
baltimore a half###hour after their latest important victory , the yankees showered and changed in the visitors' clubhouse at camden###yards as a television set beamed images from tropicana###field , where the boston###red###sox were facing the tampa###bay###rays . the outcome of that game had a direct bearing on the yankees' fortunes . still , few , if any , players watched mike###carp hit a 10th inning grand###slam to propel boston and move the yankees closer to the rays in the race for the american###league 's second wild###card spot . the yankees control their postseason future . with a come from behind , 5 4 victory over baltimore on wednesday , they vaulted past the orioles and the indians , who also lost . with 16 games left on the yankees' schedule , they trail the rays by one game and still have three to play against tampa###bay at yankee###stadium . we 're not going to take anything for granted , said robinson cano , whose ninth###inning solo home###run off tommy###hunter broke a 3 3 tie wednesday . we 're going to go game by game and give it everything we 've got . despite hearing the demoralizing news that derek###jeter 's season had come to an end because of his ankle###injury , the yankees still found the spirit to rally to a win . cano 's blast , which gave him 100 runs batted in this season , was followed one batter later by a triple from curtis###granderson . granderson then scored on lyle###overbay 's weak ground###ball single to the left side with two outs , and that insurance run proved###vital . mariano###rivera , who has played his last game alongside jeter , gave up a run but closed out the game by striking out manny###machado for his 43rd save in what he says will be his final###season . whether it ends in september or october remains to be seen . the yankees were trailing by 3 1 in the fifth when granderson connected for his fifth homer of the year , a solo blast off scott###feldman that traveled 422 feet and landed on the walkway in front of the warehouse beyond right field . an inning later , alex###rodriguez crushed a two###seam###fastball into the right field seats to even the score , 3 3 . it was his sixth home###run and his second of the series , giving him 653 in his career , seven shy of willie###mays 's . should rodriguez match mays 's total , he will earn a 6 million###bonus . rodriguez was the designated###hitter wednesday because of a tight hamstring . but with him , granderson , cano and alfonso###soriano all swinging the bat well , the yankees' lineup has suddenly become fearsome , capable of wiping out any deficit . i 've said it all along this group fights , manager joe###girardi said , and they 're continuing to fight . we get down tonight and come back again and get a huge homer by robbie and a huge###hit by lyle , which ended up being a lot bigger . girardi announced after the game that phil###hughes , who has a###4 13 record and had been demoted to the bullpen , would start thursday 's game . hughes was asked if the start was an opportunity for redemption , but he was more focused on the immediate . we just have to win games , he said . there 's no underlying story###lines . david robertson , who had been shut down for five days because of inflammation in his right shoulder , pitched the eighth and gave up a leadoff###single to machado . he struck out chris###davis on a curveball and got adam jones to hit into a fielder 's choice . danny###valencia reached on a single that went underneath the glove of the yankees' new shortstop , brendan ryan , but robertson got matt###wieters to tap back to the mound for the final out , paving the way for cano , granderson and overbay . andy###pettitte , who has not lost a start since aug . 5 , when he gave up seven runs to the chicago###white###sox , pitched six and one third innings and gave up nine hits and three runs , but he did not figure in the decision . austin romine received a diagnosis of a mild concussion , manager joe###girardi said , and will not be available for at least a couple of days . romine , who was injured in tuesday 's game when a foul tip hit him in his catcher 's mask , said that he felt much better wednesday###evening than he did when he woke up in the morning and that he was hoping to get over the symptoms quickly . ... ivan nova said that his elbow felt good and that he was encouraged that he could make his next start .
sven olaf kamphuis calls himself the minister of telecommunications and foreign###affairs for the republic of cyberbunker . others see him as the prince of spam . mr . kamphuis , who is actually dutch , is at the heart of an international investigation into one of the biggest cyberattacks identified by authorities . he has not been charged with any crime and he denies direct###involvement . but because of his outspoken position in a loose federation of hackers , authorities in the netherlands and several other countries are examining what role he or the internet companies he runs played in snarling traffic on the web this week . he describes himself in his own web postings as an internet###freedom fighter , along the lines of julian###assange of wikileaks , with political views that range from eccentric to offensive . his likes german heavy###metal###music , beavis###and###butt###head and the campaign to legalize medicinal marijuana . his dislikes jews , luddites and authority . dutch computer security experts and former associates describe mr . kamphuis as a loner with brilliant programming skills . he did not respond to various requests for interviews , but he has communicated with the public through his facebook###page , which includes photos of himself , a thin , angular man with close cropped hair and dark , bushy eyebrows , often wearing a hoodie sweatshirt . he 's like a loose cannon , said erik bais , the owner of a2b internet , an internet###service###provider that used to work with mr . kamphuis 's company , but severed###ties two years###ago . he has no regard for repercussions or collateral###damage . mr . kamphuis 's current nemesis is spamhaus , a group based in geneva that fights internet spam by publishing blacklists of alleged offenders . clients of spamhaus use the information to block annoying e mails offering discount viagra or financial windfalls . but mr . kamphuis and other critics call spamhaus a censor that judges what is or is n't spam . spamhaus acted , he wrote , without any court###verdict , just by blackmail of suppliers and jew lies . the spat that rocked the internet escalated in mid###march when spamhaus blacklisted two companies that mr . kamphuis runs , cb3rob , an internet###service###provider , and cyberbunker , a web###hosting###service . spamhaus contended that cyberbunker was a conduit for vast amounts of spam . cyberbunker says it accepts business from any site as long as it does not deal in child###porn nor anything related to terrorism . mr . kamphuis responded by soliciting support for a hackers' campaign to snarl spamhaus 's internet operations . yo anons , we could use a little help in shutting down illegal slander and blackmail censorship project 'spamhaus . org , ' which thinks it can dictate its views on what should and should not be on the internet , he wrote on facebook on march . mr . kamphuis later disavowed any direct role in the so called distributed###denial###of###service , or ddos , attack , which spilled over from spamhaus to affect other sites . he took to facebook to inform the world that the flood of internet###traffic that threatened to cripple parts of the web emanated from stophaus , an ad###hoc , amorphous group set up in january with the aim to thwart spamhaus , a company it claims uses its tiny business to attempt to control the internet through underhanded extortion tactics . stophaus , which lists no contact or location for the group , claims to have members in the united###states , canada , russia , ukraine , china and western###europe . mr . kamphuis said stophaus was not a front for him he is merely acting as a spokesman . nonetheless , the authorities are curious . the dutch national prosecutor 's office said on thursday that it had opened an investigation . wim de bruin , a spokesman for the agency , which is based in rotterdam , said prosecutors were first trying to determine whether the ddos###attacks had originated in the netherlands . authorities in britain and several other european###countries are also looking into the matter . mr . kamphuis , who is believed to be about , is singled out because of his vocal role . for the dutch internet community , it 's very clear that he has a big role in this , even if there is n't 100 percent airtight proof that he is behind it , said j . p . velders , a security specialist at the university of amsterdam . he could not be not involved . how much is he involved that is for law enforcement to figure out and to act upon . greenhost , a dutch internet hosting###service , said in a detailed blog post that it had found the digital fingerprints of cb3rob when it examined the rogue traffic that had been directed at spamhaus . mr . kamphuis created cb3rob in 1996 and helped###set up cyberbunker in . from 1999 to , he worked on the help desk at a dutch internet###service###provider , xs4all , according to one senior manager at the company who declined to be named , citing company policy . one co worker said mr . kamphuis was constantly being reprimanded for hacking into his employer 's computer system . he was known for eccentric behavior during a company trip to berlin , the former co worker said , mr . kamphuis refused to travel with his colleagues and rode alone in a bus . sven absolutely hates authority in any form , this person said . he was very smart . too smart for customers , by the way . oftentimes they could n't###understand his technobabble when he tried to help them . after leaving xs4all , he continued to run his web###hosting business , which was based for a time in a former army bunker in goes , the netherlands . photos on mr . kamphuis 's facebook###page show him holding a flag in front of the bunker , like a freedom###fighter defending his redoubt . cyberbunker still lists its address as the bunker . but joost verboom , a dutch businessman , says the address is occupied by his own

new york bernard###tomic 's agent asked the u.s . open to give the player 's father a credential despite a tour wide ban , and the u.s . tennis association turned the request down , tournament spokesman chris widmaier said sunday . we opted not to credential him , widmaier said in an interview . our desire is to make it as difficult as possible for him to gain###entry to the u.s . open . john tomic , who also is his son 's coach , was barred earlier this year from gaining official access to tournaments by the atp and the international###tennis###federation after being accused of head###butting bernard 's hitting partner when they were in spain for a tournament . bernard###tomic is a 20 year old australian who was a wimbledon quarterfinalist in , and reached the fourth###round at the all england club in july . considered his country 's most promising young tennis###player , he has been ranked as high as 27th , and is currently 52nd . he is scheduled to play albert###ramos of spain on the grandstand on monday , the first day of main draw action at the u.s . open , the last grand###slam###tournament of the season . after winning his first round###match at wimbledon this year , the younger tomic criticized the atp for preventing his father from attending tournaments for 12 months , saying the tour rushed to judgment in the case . both the french###open and wimbledon said john tomic would n't be allowed###entry into their tournaments' facilities , even if he were to purchase a ticket . widmaier said the u.s . open would follow that policy , too . our gate personnel that scan tickets will have been informed that he 's an unwanted guest , widmaier said . it would be within our right to escort him off the grounds . however , we have not determined what our exact policy will be at this time .

about , 000 monkeys at a harvard###medical###school research center will be moved to other laboratories around the country as the school shuts down the troubled center , an official with the national###institutes###of###health said wednesday . the school announced tuesday that it would close the facility , the new england primate research center in southborough , mass . , over the next two years . harvard said financial uncertainties were behind the move , but the laboratory has been cited in recent###years by the federal department of agriculture for failing to comply with the animal###welfare act , and four primates have died there since mid . the center , which has operated for nearly half a century and has contributed to research on aids and other diseases , employs about 200 people , including research faculty and support###staff . it is one of eight national primate research###centers that , in all , received about 87 million from the national###institutes###of###health last year . the n.i.h . official , dr . james###anderson , a deputy###director , said there were currently about 130 research###projects at the southborough center . n.i.h . officials , along with representatives from harvard and the other national###research centers , will review them case by case , he said . they all work closely together they know each other 's inventory , dr . anderson said . we 'll go through when and where to move the animals and projects . according to a u.s.d.a . inspection###report in november , the center has more than , 500 rhesus###macaques as well as smaller###numbers of other species , including cotton top tamarins , which are among the smallest primates and are less commonly used in research . i think they 'll all find a place , dr . anderson said . harvard has said that none of the animals would be euthanized . we are in the early###stages and focusing our attention on working with our faculty , staff and the n.i.h . in order to assure a transition that is orderly and respectful to all concerned , including the animals , gina vild , a spokeswoman for the medical###school , said wednesday . in announcing that it had opted not to seek to renew a five year n.i.h . grant , the school said it had decided that winding down the laboratory 's operations was more beneficial to the school than investing further resources . among the incidents that prompted u.s.d.a . action , in 2010 a cotton###top###tamarin that apparently###died of natural causes was found dead in a cage that had been sent through a sanitizing machine . in , a tamarin had to be euthanized after it was found dehydrated because of a malfunctioning water###bottle in its cage . the medical###school revamped some laboratory procedures and made some staffing changes . the school disclosed to the boston###globe last year that it had been put on probation by an international group that accredits animal###research programs the globe also reported on the plan to close the center . chris newcomer , director of the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international , said he thought there was no link between the animal care problems cited and the school 's decision to close the center . i think science is much too big to close it simply because the u.s.d.a . criticized it , he said . it 's a very big and significant###scientific endeavor . april d . truitt , executive###director of the primate rescue center , a private sanctuary in nicholasville , ky . , that is home to more than 50 monkeys and apes , said she was a little skeptical of harvard 's claim that the closing had nothing to do with the animal###welfare violations . if the school wanted to put some or all of the monkeys in private sanctuaries , she said , there was plenty of room at facilities around the country . it 's just a question of money , she said .
landover , md . in a span of seven washington###redskins offensive plays , justin###tuck sacked robert###griffin###iii four times . in a span of 10 pass attempts , eli###manning completed all . if tuck and manning had been humming like that all season , the new york giants would n't be on the fringes of the playoff###race . as it is , they 've made it to 5 7 not bad after an 0 6 start with sunday###night 's 24 17 win over the redskins . if i was standing here with four sacks and a loss , i would n't give two cents , said tuck , who had only 2 sacks on the season entering the game . but we got a win . i played pretty good tonight . the win keeps the giants ( 5 7 ) two games behind division leaders dallas and philadelphia with four to play . after last week 's loss we were probably going to have to win five in a row , manning said , and this is the first one , the redskins , meanwhile , were eliminated from the postseason for the 17th time in 21 years and finished the season 0 5 in prime time . when you 're out of it , yeah , it 's very disappointing . ... you do n't like to play for pride , washington coach mike###shanahan said , but sometimes that 's the card that 's dealt , and that 's where we 're at right now . the giants let griffin do essentially whatever he wanted early on the quarterback completed 16 of 17 passes in the first half but tuck and the giants defense took over when it mattered , holding the redskins to 96 second half yards . linebacker jon beason finished with 17 tackles in a game new york played without defensive###end jason###pierre###paul ( shoulder ) and cornerback corey###webster ( ankle . the defense clinched the game with one final big play , when safety will hill wrestled the ball from pierre garcon after the receiver made a catch near midfield with 21 remaining as the redskins were driving for a possible tying###score . the turnover came two plays after a confusing moment in which washington apparently thought it had a first down the sideline down marker was at 1'' when it was actually third and . shanahan vented at officials over the miscue , which referee jeff triplette said was caused when the chains were incorrectly moved , but the redskins technically converted the fourth and 1 anyway because garcon had enough yardage for the first down before he was stripped of the ball . manning and griffin put on quite the statistical show in the first half they were a combined 26 for 29 for 250 yards at halftime before the same troubles that have beset both teams resurfaced in droves . manning had a high throw tipped for an interception in the third quarter , and he remains on course to have more interceptions than touchdown passes for the first time since his rookie###season . manning was also sacked three times , giving him a career###high of . but the redskins could only convert manning 's interception into a field###goal even though they got the ball at the new york . that gave washington a 17 14 lead , which evaporated after a gaffe by the consensus worst special teams units in the league . redskins long###snapper kyle nelson sent a bouncing grounder back to punter sav rocca , leading to a blocked###punt that was compounded by a holding penalty on nelson that added 10 yards to the final spot . the giants took over at the washington 46 and needed only four plays and an unsportsmanlike###conduct###penalty on cornerback deangelo###hall to produce andre brown 's 1 yard touchdown run that made the score , putting the giants ahead for good early in the fourth###quarter . you ca n't###stop yourselves , shanahan said . we had some penalties . we had some dropped balls . we had a couple missed assignments . you couple all those things and that 's how you lose a football game . manning finished 22 for 28 for 235 yards , including a 22 yard touchdown pass to brandon myers in the second quarter that was part of the 10 completions in a row . after his stellar first half , griffin was 8 for 15 for 58 yards in the second half for a final line of 24 for 32 for 207 yards and a season high 88 yards###rushing on 12 carries . he was n't sacked in the first half , but he went down five times after halftime . he outran me on a few plays , tuck said , but i thought he looked good until we were able to make some adjustments . notes the redskins scored a touchdown on their opening###possession for the first time this season . ... the giants had only one running play of 20 plus yards entering the game , but they had two on the same drive , including a 23 yard touchdown run by brown that made the score . ... redskins injuries cb hall ( left hip , lb london###fletcher ( sprained###ankle .
newport , n.h . when the new hampshire association of chiefs of police was looking to raise###money for an annual cadet training###program , it sold raffle tickets for 30 apiece . the drawing was scheduled for may , but by jan . 12 all , 000 tickets had been sold . the prize 31 guns , with a new winner drawn each day of the month . the fund###raiser , sponsored by the association in partnership with two new hampshire gun makers , sig###sauer and sturm , ruger company , has prompted a chorus of protests from lawmakers and gun###control advocates questioning why the police are giving away guns , even in the name of a good cause . some in law enforcement have also raised###questions . when chief nicholas j . giaccone jr . of hanover pulled up information about the raffle on the internet , he said , he was flabbergasted . i looked at the first weapon and googled that one , said chief giaccone , who recalled using an expletive when he pulled up information about the ruger sr 556c , a semiautomatic weapon . it 's an assault###rifle . in a letter to the editor of the eagle tribune , which covers southern new hampshire , richard j . o'shaughnessy of salem wrote , people who should know better are adding to the glorification of the gun culture in this state . and referring to the shootings last month at sandy###hook elementary###school in connecticut , state representative sharon l . nordgren , a hanover democrat , said , they 're just the same kind that were used in newtown . the ruger that caught chief giaccone 's attention is an ar 15 style rifle , which is the most popular style of gun in america , according to dealers , and was the type used by adam lanza to kill 20 children and six adults at the elementary###school . another gun in the raffle , the sig###sauer p226 handgun , was also carried by mr . lanza , according to the connecticut###state###police . it 's just ironic that that would be their choice of the kind of gun that they 're raffling , ms . nordgren said . organizers of the raffle are standing firm . in a statement released this month , chief paul t . donovan of salem , the president of the association , defended the fund###raiser , saying that all winners would be required to meet all applicable###rules for gun###ownership . while this raffle falls on the heels of the recent tragedy in newtown , conn . , the new hampshire association of chiefs of police extends their deepest sympathies to the families and first responders , chief donovan wrote . new hampshire chiefs of police feel the issues with these tragic shootings are ones that are contrary to lawful and responsible gun###ownership . the proceeds from the raffle go toward a cadet program involving participants ages 14 to 20 who are given instructions in various kinds of police skills and procedures . some of them go on to pursue###careers in law enforcement . the guns will be distributed through another raffle partner , rody 's gun###shop , a windowless outpost here in newport , a town that comes to life when employees of ruger , which is one of its main###employers , leave work for the day . around here , most people are into guns , said michael gaffney , an employee of a nearby hardware###store who won a rifle in a raffle years###ago . you get a chance to win a free gun ! it 's like any raffle , very much akin to trailer raffles , snowmobile raffles or turkey raffles . on a recent weeknight , the rody 's parking###lot was filled with idling cars , their occupants waiting for the store to open at 6 o'clock . the store filled up immediately . customers , some with their children in tow , browsed the shotguns and rifles on the walls and discussed the possibility of gun bans . while the shop 's owner would not comment on the raffle , his customers were nonchalant . honestly , i do n't see what the big###deal is they 're just talking about it because of sandy###hook , said lorraine peterson of litchfield . i do n't mean to sound insensitive . this is new hampshire . this is a sport . gun raffles are business as usual here and in many other parts of the country frequently used by hunting clubs and sometimes by athletics booster clubs to raise###money and anchor galas . we host raffles like this all the time , said richard olson jr . , the president of the new hampshire wildlife federation and the londonderry fish and game club . anybody that 's speaking up is using the newtown massacre as a pretext to poke at the issue negatively . mr . olson said that he once planned a gun raffle to raise###money for a fishing derby and that he was considering using one to raise###money for the wildlife federation 's conservation efforts on new england cottontail rabbits . shifting economic and political conditions have spread gun raffles to other spheres , too . josh harms , a republican state representative in illinois , intends to raffle three guns in march to raise###money for his campaign treasury . greg hay , a firefighter from quincy , ill . , said his union decided last january to hold a gun raffle to replenish its accounts after a drawn out arbitration . he said the sluggish economy had limited fund raising from the union 's annual country###music concert . we did n't really want to have any more assessments , so we needed to start looking at better moneymakers , said mr . hay , who expects the union , quincy firefighters local , to take home about , 000 from the raffle , which started last june and awards one gun per week for a year . the fund###raiser has been so successful that the union had planned to sponsor a second one until a recent increase in gun prices fueled by increased###demand amid###fears of gun bans in the wake of the newtown shooting made the effort less promising . maybe we 'll hold off until gun prices go down and start to go back to a decent level , mr . hay said . opponents of the raffle in new hampshire are quick to say it is not the guns they oppose , but the fact that the police are conducting it . i think in some respects it shows the wrong###message , said state representative stephen shurtleff , democrat of merrimack . for law enforcement , normally they 're dealing with firearms in a negative way . for that reason , it 's just not an appropriate thing . we 're trying to get guns off the street .
like many major###cities around the world , liverpool 's legacy from the 2008 global downturn was a glut of unfinished and unsold apartments . but just five years later , the city 's plans###include thousands of new residential###properties , part of the city 's effort to regain its status as a hub of business and residential life in northwest england . alan bevan , managing###director of city residential , a local real###estate agency , said the city 's relatively low property prices , solid rental###market and infrastructure###improvements had been attracting new residents from around britain and the rest of the world . we 're seeing interest from young###professionals who are coming to the city for work or study , he said . but also retirees and empty nesters who are downsizing and want to be near to cultural###attractions and services , and investors who want rental###units . from the 18th century through the early 20th century , liverpool 's location at the mouth of the river###mersey and the irish###sea put it at the heart of britain 's shipping , export and manufacturing###industries . but , as these sectors declined , so did the city . by the 1980s it was suffering from high unemployment and a lack of investment , though regeneration of its neglected but culturally###important areas began during that time . its maritime mercantile city , a collection of six sites , now is listed on the unesco###world###heritage roster and includes the famous royal###liver###building , one of britain 's first multistory buildings made with reinforced###concrete . one of the focuses of liverpool 's urban###renewal plans is that historic waterfront , now a patchwork of new and renovated buildings and dilapidated old ones . the other is the city center , where beautiful georgian and victorian###architecture sits###alongside smart new retailing , residential and cultural projects like the 42 acre , or 17 hectare , liverpool one . among the residential###projects that faltered in the aftermath of 2008 but have since been revived is the albany , a renovated 19th century building where city residential is selling one bedroom apartments starting at , 000 pounds , or , 000 . the high###rise west tower , reintroduced last year , has sold 102 of its 123 apartments . those developments are competing for buyers with popular established projects like wapping and waterloo quays , the colonnades , one park west and mann island , where prices range from , 000 for a one bedroom to around , 000 for a top end three bedroom duplex or penthouse . a large proportion of apartments in the city are not owned by their residents , according to shannon conway , residential sales manager at the local office of jones###lang###lasalle real###estate . there are n't really enough buyers , so a large###number of apartment developments are predominantly rental accommodation , she said . but then , of liverpool 's , 000 residents , approximately , 000 are students at the four universities in the city . as many students prefer to rent because they are unsure about staying in the city after graduation , and probably are financially unable to buy anyway , there are not enough rental###units in the city center to meet###demand , ms . conway said . mr . bevan of city residential said investors in liverpool had included chinese and southeast###asians , many of whom have purchased purpose built student###accommodation , with prices starting at about , 000 for a studio . northern###europeans , in particular scandinavians , are attracted to small###apartments for tourism rental or leisure use , he said . he also noted that liverpool 's soccer teams had a large overseas following . on match###days you ca n't get good hotel accommodation in the city , he said . i 've sold studios and one bed apartments to a number of buyers who use them when there 's a football match on . the situation does offer###opportunities for buyers who have secured financing , ms . conway said . because properties in liverpool are much cheaper than in cities such as manchester or london , the yields are currently quite high , at around 8 percent , she said . however , you wo n't get the same capital appreciation .

except for maybe this year . beatriz###recari birdied the two closing par 5s to catch paula###creamer atop the leaderboard through 54 holes saturday , setting up a head to head battle between players who are three shots clear of the field . recari , a 26 year old spaniard who has won twice on the lpga###tour , conceded that it 's hard not to get caught up in a two person competition . definitely , it 's easier because you 're playing with the player closest to you in score , she said . you still have to do your best . you ca n't###control what she does , so you always have to stay###focused on what you 're doing . they were at 12 under 201 after each shooting 4 under . the showdown could be a preview . recari is expected to make the european team for the solheim###cup next month where match###play rules and creamer is one of the mainstays of the american side . creamer , who won in 2008 when the tournament was known as the jamie###farr toledo classic , led throughout the round by as many as two shots before recari 's late###surge at highland meadows . she was pleased to find herself being the hunted instead of the hunter . i love this feeling , said creamer , who has nine wins but none since the 2010 u.s . women 's open . i have n't felt it for a while . i 've normally been chasing the leaders , but this is great . this is right where i wanted to be . the last time she played in the same group with recari , it was recari who had the edge . in the third round of the kia###classic in march in california , recari shot a 69 when paired in the last grouping with creamer , who had a . recari , who had won the cvs last year , ended up winning in a playoff with i.k . kim . creamer faded to a tie for 17th . she 's a great player , recari said . it 's always great to play with her . creamer , who set the tournament record with a first round 60 in her victory###lap five years###ago , is expecting a battle . she 's steady . she hits a lot of fairways and greens and gives herself a lot of opportunities to make birdies , she said about recari . at the same time , there are so many players out there that you have to kind of be aware of . but she 's definitely going to be fighting until the end . there are plenty of potential challengers , even though several of the biggest###names including world no . 1 inbee###park , defending champ so yeon ryu and top amateur lydia###ko all fell back into the pack . rising american teen lexi###thompson had a 67 and , along with jacqui concolino and japan 's chie arimura , was three shots back . i 've been working on trusting my targets picking out a target and just visualizing my shot , thompson said . that 's what i 've been doing every shot . i 've committed pretty good to them . concolino , whose career best tie for 11th came at the event last year , had a . she has revived her desire to play since taking time off from competitive###golf after graduating from vanderbilt in . i just got a little burnt out in college and needed some time to myself , she said of her lengthy hiatus . ever since i was , i 've been doing everything for golf , golf , golf . i never really had time to enjoy friends and family how you would want to . so that 's what i did for a year and a half , two years , and started to get back on track . arimura , fourth in the lpga 's rookie standings , three putted the final hole for bogey and a . jennifer johnson , chella###choi ( 66 ) and jodi ewart shadoff ( 68 ) were at . park has been the talk of the tour this year , with six victories including wins in all three of the major championships . she 'll go for four in a row when the tour returns to action in two weeks at the women 's british###open at st . andrew 's . but after winning three in a row and with a solid finish last week , she sagged to a 73 that left her tied for 23rd . she double bogeyed the first hole after hitting her drive into a fairway bunker and never recovered . that was n't the worst of it . i just putted really bad today , she said , after dropping from sole###possession of fifth place through 36 holes . outside of that , everything else was really similar ( to earlier###rounds of 67 and , but nothing seems to be going in . ryu , who shot a 62 in the final round to win a year ago by seven strokes , shot a 70 and was six shots back of the leaders . ko became the youngest lpga winner ever when she took the canadian women 's open last year at , but she had a 71 and was tied with ryu at . alison walshe , tied with recari and creamer after the second round , fell back with a . creamer said that she 'll try not to concentrate only on her version of match###play with ricari . you can get hot out here and shoot a low number , so i ca n't###worry too much about what she 's doing , she said . i 've got to go out and play my own game because there are going to be a lot of players that can fire at pins and post a low###score . i 'll just have to make as many birdies as i can .
paris###france should abandon its effort to unilaterally enact taxes on global internet companies and should instead work at the international###level to create a###level playing###field , according to a report from a government advisory###committee . the introduction of a digital tax would be both unrealistic and economically devastating , the french digital council said in a report delivered to president###fran###ois###hollande 's government on tuesday . fleur pellerin , the digital###economy minister , asked the council in january to study tax policy for the digital###economy . french political###leaders , struggling to bring the country 's budget###deficit into line with european###union rules , have looked at companies like google and amazon , which make billions###of###dollars in france but pay almost no taxes , as a possible source of revenue . the companies pay few taxes through legal , though sometimes questionable , practices like allocating profit to countries with lower taxes and exploiting regulatory differences between countries . the council argued that the government 's efforts would be best deployed by working with the group of 20 nations , the organization for economic###cooperation and development and the european###union to change the global rules in such a way as to ensure fairer taxation of multinational technology companies . going it alone at the national###level , the council said , could undermine france 's position in these talks . the council noted that other taxes had been proposed , including for online###advertising , e###commerce , bandwidth use and connected###devices , but said those do not allow the fundamentally global nature of the relevant value chains to be factored in . they could have harmful tax ramifications for french businesses and consumers . the council 's opinion is not binding on the government , but ms . pellerin has appeared for some time to be trying to dampen the expectations of officials hoping for a more aggressive###policy . in a statement wednesday , ms . pellerin and bernard cazeneuve , the budget minister , noted that the council 's recommendations go in the direction of the international action the government is already taking . those actions include support for the o.e.c.d . 's initiative to curb tax###evasion and the european###commission 's work toward creating a consolidated corporate###tax base for companies active in the 28 nation bloc . french and international internet companies welcomed the news . a statement from a consortium of industry associations , including the afdel group , which represents software companies including google , noted their satisfaction that the council had taken into account their recommendations and thorough consultation . it would be paradoxical , at the least , to enact measures that would inhibit the widest possible diffusion of digital devices and services and which would isolate france at a time of european harmonization , the industry statement said .
the mets had finally and mercifully departed the city , leaving the yankees behind to contend with a more formidable and important foe . intracity rivalry turned to intradivisional rivalry friday as the yankees felt the pressure to end a five###game###losing###streak . the return of two key players from lengthy stays on the disabled###list was supposed to be the balm that would soothe the sting of the mets' four game sweep . mark###teixeira and kevin###youkilis finally came back , but it was the seeming return of a player who never left that was the most helpful and reassuring aspect to the yankees' evening . after a month of baffling performances and questions about his ability to pitch with a slightly###slower fastball , the old c . c . sabathia dominant , aggressive and precise suddenly reappeared on the mound when the yankees needed him most . pitching like the ace he is supposed to be , sabathia held the red###sox to one run over seven and a third commanding innings as the yankees beat the red###sox , 4 1 , ending their losing###streak and his own and moving within a game of first place boston in the american###league###east . it was sabathia 's first win since april , and in his previous five starts he was 0 2 with a . 85 earned###run###average . as much as the yankees have minimized the mysterious dip in sabathia 's velocity coming into friday 's game , the fact that he reached 94 miles###per###hour with his fastball with regularity for the first time this season was suddenly greeted with near jubilation from nearly all corners . his velocity was getting up there a little bit and i think he could feel the moment , vernon###wells said . this is a big###game for us with the way we 've been playing . him being able to get back on the mound and do what he did was huge for us . since the beginning of last season , sabathia is 9 2 with a . 63 e.r.a . after a yankees loss . he gave up six hits , walked none and struck out , tying his season high in that category . and to underscore wells 's point that sabathia seemed to be motivated for what was really a vital game , it was the first time since he joined the yankees that he struck out 10 without issuing a walk . with us having a tough week and us being swept by the mets , you want to go out and have a good game , sabathia said . i was lucky enough to do that tonight . luck had almost nothing to do with it . sabathia was replaced after getting the first out of the eighth###inning on his 109th pitch . all game he worked ahead of hitters , pitching with confidence and attacking them with the resurgence of his high velocity heaters . for manager joe###girardi , the only explanation for the increased pace of his fastballs was the warm###weather . i have n't seen any 94s until tonight , girardi said , and there were a lot of 92s and 94s whereas we 've seen a lot of 89s to 91s . teixeira went 0 for 3 and scored a run in his season debut after a three month recovery from a torn tendon sheath in his wrist , and youkilis returned from a bulging disk in his back to go 1 for 4 with a run batted in . mariano###rivera , who blew his first save opportunity of the season against the mets on tuesday , returned to the mound for the first time since then and earned his 19th save , despite giving up ground###ball singles to dustin###pedroia and david###ortiz with one out . he struck out mike###napoli , then got stephen###drew to ground out to end the losing###streak . if he would have loaded the bases with nobody out , brett###gardner said , i still would feel good about my chances . but even with rivera 's comeback performance and the return of youkilis and teixeira , this game was about the return of sabathia and the promise it could hold . he was disconsolate after allowing a season high seven runs in his last outing against tampa###bay that started the yankees' losing###streak , and vowed to be more aggressive . catcher chris stewart said that from the moment sabathia started warming up in the bullpen , his stuff was hard and true , and it held into the game . sabathia insists that he does not look up at the radar###gun readings on the scoreboard during his games , and that he does not care###anymore what they say . when i was younger , i did , he said . i thought that was the way i was getting guys out . but as i get older , i know it 's more about location than velocity . ivan nova and vidal nuno were optioned to class###aaa scranton wilkes###barre to make room for mark###teixeira and kevin###youkilis on the 25 man roster . nova and nuno are expected to join the starting###rotation there . ... after failing to draw a walk in their last three games , the yankees drew four on friday , all of which led off innings . ... joe###girardi was ejected for arguing a call in the sixth###inning . he admitted that replays showed he was wrong . ... kareem###abdul###jabbar watched the game from the stands wearing a brooklyn dodgers hat .
( reuters ) english###premier###league clubs spent almost 100 million###pounds . 81 million ) on agents fees for brokering player###transfers in the past 12 months , an increase of almost 20 million###pounds on the previous year . the figures were released on saturday by the league , who have compiled and made the figures public since the 2009 10 season . the total spent by the 20 premier###league###clubs was . 67 million###pounds . 35 million ) in the year from october , 2012 until september . they spent 77 million###pounds in . london club chelsea , who signed several new players including demba###ba , willian and samuel###eto'o and brought in manager jose mourinho , paid . 7 million###pounds in agents' fees , almost double what they spent in . manchester###city were the second highest spenders , paying . 18 million###pounds , up from . 54 million in the previous year . champions manchester united spent . 32 million###pounds , while crystal###palace spent the least out of all 20 sides with a total of , 531 pounds .
( reuters ) mark###hughes took over as stoke city###manager on a three year contract on thursday , saying he wanted to prove critics wrong and restore his reputation after being fired by queens###park###rangers last year . the former manchester###united striker replaces fellow welshman tony###pulis who left the premier###league###club by mutual###consent last week after seven years in charge . i 'm really grateful ... they 've###looked maybe beyond my last position and taken my career as a manager as a whole , hughes told a news conference at the club 's clayton wood training###ground . mistakes were made ( at qpr ) and certainly i made mistakes which i will learn from , added the 49 year old . i have had something like 270 games at premier###league level and people in recent###months possibly have wanted to define my managerial career on the basis of 12 months of last season ... maybe it gives me more motivation to prove people wrong . hughes was sacked by qpr in november , departing after a miserable start to the season with the west londoners , at that point the only club in england 's four professional divisions not to have recorded a win . in total , he won only eight of his 34 games in charge at loftus###road . the former blackburn rovers , manchester###city , fulham and wales manager was replaced at qpr by harry###redknapp who failed to stave off relegation . hughes said he had kept quiet for the past six months but had listened to what people had said and would use that positively at stoke . my intention is to take this club and team itself forward and make sure we are successful in the future , he said . the success tony had enables me to have a better chance because i 'm following somebody who has put in place things that enable the club to be stable and has created an environment that is conducive to being successful in the premier###league . stoke chairman peter coates would not be drawn on how much spending###money hughes would have and said the club wanted to be sustainable . it 's a great blot on the premier###league that there is so much debt when there 's so much money , added coates . we want to have a sustainable model , we can do that and still provide funds for the manager . coates said hughes was the right fit for stoke , with a record that spoke for itself . we also understand that whoever we choose , some people will disagree and i do n't have a problem with that , he said . those who focus on qpr , that 's fair enough , but they should look at the bigger###picture and see what he has achieved throughout his career . . stoke , who finished 13th in the 20 team league last season , parted###company with pulis after the abrasive style of football he oversaw led to some disgruntlement from fans . hughes said the club had a strong squad and he would not come in and wipe away all the hard work that 's been put in place in previous###seasons . what i will look to do is hopefully make them a little bit more offensive and i 'd like to think the teams i 've been involved in have always scored a good level of goals , he added . but we 're not going to chuck the baby out with the bath water . it 's about steady###progress , making sure we do it at the correct###speed .
oakland , calif . maybe a game winning , broken bat hit against baseball 's career###saves leader in the 18th inning will get nate###freiman in a nice groove again . freiman singled home the winning###run against mariano###rivera , lifting the oakland###athletics to a 3 2 victory over the new york yankees on thursday for a three game sweep . it was his deal , freiman said of the cut fastball he saw . that one he always throws . as a day game after a night game turned into a night game after a day game , john###jaso singled off preston claiborne ( 0 1 ) to start the decisive rally and went to third on seth###smith 's soft single to shallow left###field against rivera . rivera issued only the 39th intentional###walk of his 19 year career to jed###lowrie before freiman ended the 5 hour , 35 minute game on new york 's getaway day to anaheim for a weekend series with the angels . a little broken bat blooper over the third baseman , and the other one the same place , rivera said . you ca n't do anything about it . freiman knew he had it , raising his right arm in triumph . i knew that was not getting to the left###fielder . i knew it was falling , he said . moments later , freiman received a celebratory whipped###cream pie in the face following his first career game ending hit and oakland 's fifth of 2013 after compiling a major###league best 14 walk off wins last year . he had entered the game in the top of the 16th . the al west leading a 's ( 41 27 ) won their 11th in a row at home , 21 st in 26 overall , and moved a season best 14 games above . 500 to extend their best start since . they became the first american###league team to play two 18 inning games in one season since oakland and the washington###senators did so in . freiman 's wife , lpga golfer amanda blumenherst , quickly congratulated her husband on twitter ahhh ! ! nate just ended the 18 inning###game ! bases###loaded , single ! ! pie in the face ! athletics win ! each team used seven pitchers and threw 255 pitches . in all , 137 batters came to the plate short of the season high of 156 during oakland 's 19 inning win over the angels in april and also the 20 inning###game between the marlins and mets last saturday . it was very taxing even winning the game . to lose could have been demoralizing , a 's manager bob###melvin said . these are awful games to lose . new york made a dramatic play in the bottom of the 15th to keep the game going . pinch###hitter coco###crisp singled to left with one out and vernon###wells made a perfect throw to catcher chris stewart , who blocked the plate and absorbed a collision to prevent brandon###moss from scoring the winning###run . the a 's had already begun streaming out of the dugout to celebrate . the yankees had runners in scoring###position in each of the extra###innings through , stranding 11 baserunners . they left 13 on base in all while dropping their seventh in a row at the oakland###coliseum . pitching for the first time in eight days , jesse###chavez ( 1 0 ) struck out seven in 5 2 3 scoreless###innings . chavez fanned kevin###youkilis and wells with two on to end the 13th , then travis###hafner and wells in the 15th . jerry###blevins escaped a bases###loaded jam in the top of the 11th with two strikeouts . pat###neshek worked out of trouble with runners on first and second in the 12th . robinson cano hit a two run homer in the first as new york ended a season long five game stretch without a long ball , but the yankees did n't###score again on another day of missed###opportunities . i think it 's probably a little more frustrating because you can look at how you had an opportunity here and an opportunity there , manager joe###girardi said . a lot of guys probably look at that , but it does n't###change the result . it was the longest day game in coliseum history . neither a' starter jarrod###parker nor new york counterpart hiroki###kuroda got a decision after a nice pitchers' duel hours before the game ended . after smith 's tying , two out double in the third , oakland did n't###reach base again until jaso 's bloop single leading off the ninth . oakland won the season series 5 1 for its second best mark against the yankees in franchise###history . the 1990 club went . the a 's tied it at 2 in the third on a close play at the plate . smith doubled off the wall in right and the relay throw was on target to stewart , who tagged jaso with his glove but had the ball in his bare hand . jaso was called safe by plate###umpire cb bucknor , drawing an argument from girardi . earlier in the inning , derek###norris' rbi groundout scored chris###young , who drew a leadoff walk . eric sogard followed with a single before the a 's pulled off a double steal . parker , riding a three start winning###streak , was helped by a pair of double plays in the first four innings . kuroda 's winless stretch reached five starts since he beat toronto on may . he became the third japanese born pitcher with , 000 innings in the majors , joining hideo###nomo and tomo###ohka . girardi bumped jayson###nix up to the no . 2 spot in the batting order from eighth a night earlier to shake###things up and get the yankees going , but nix went 1 for 5 with a strikeout to end the 12th . notes yankees captain derek###jeter had his surgically repaired left ankle examined by dr . robert###anderson in charlotte , n.c. , and was cleared to resume baseball activities and running . ... crisp ( bruised heel ) and lf yoenis cespedes ( tight left hamstring ) were held out of the starting###lineup . ... rivera received a surfboard and a bottle of white###wine from napa###valley from the a 's in a pregame ceremony , along with a , 042 donation to his foundation . ... the a 's are 7 0 2 in their last nine series . ... new york agreed to contract terms with notre###dame 3b eric jagielo , who signed for , 839 , 400 . he was the 26th overall pick in last week 's draft and one of three first round###selections by the yankees .
there was a time not that long###ago when it was easy to tell the difference between viruses and the rest of life . most obviously , viruses were tiny and genetically simple . the influenza###virus , for example , measures about 100 nanometers across , and has just 13 genes . those two standards , it 's now clear , belong in the trash . over the past decade , scientists have discovered a vast menagerie of viruses that are far bigger , and which carry enormous arsenals of genes . french researchers are now reporting the discovery of the biggest virus yet . the pandoravirus , as they 've dubbed it , is , 000 times bigger than the flu###virus by volume and has nearly 200 times as many genes , 556 all told . making the discovery all the more startling is the fact that , of all the genes that pandoraviruses carry , only six percent match any gene known to science . we believe we 're opening a pandora 's box not so much for humanity but for dogma about viruses , said dr . jean###michel claverie of the university of mediterran e , co author of the paper that was published###online thursday in the journal science . we believe we 're touching an alternative tree of life . giant viruses would be important enough simply for the way they have blurred the line between viruses and the rest of life . but they excite scientists for another reason . utterly unknown a decade###ago , they turn out to be everywhere , including in our own bodies . what effect they have on the world 's ecosystem or our own health is anyone 's guess right now . it was the very giant ness of giant viruses that allowed them to be overlooked for so long . scientists first discovered viruses in the late 1800s when they were puzzled by a disease that beset tobacco plants . they mashed up wilted tobacco leaves with water and passed the mixture through fine###porcelain filters that trapped bacteria and fungi . the clear###liquid could still make healthy tobacco leaves sick . the dutch botanist martinus###beijerinck dubbed it a contagious living fluid . in the 1930s , the invention of powerful microscopes finally###allowed scientists to see viruses . they found that viruses were unlike ordinary cells they did n't generate their own fuel they did n't###grow or divide . instead , viruses invaded cells , hijacking their biochemistry to make new copies of themselves . being small and simple seemed like part of the viral way of life , allowing them to replicate fast . it was n't until 2003 that a team of french researchers###discovered the first giant virus . they had been puzzling over sphere shaped###objects that were the size of bacteria but contained no bacterial dna . eventually they realized that they were looking at a monstrously oversized virus , containing 979 genes . those first giant viruses were isolated from amoebae living in water from a cooling###tower . once scientists realized that viruses could be so large , they changed their search parameters and started finding other species in all manner of places , from swamps to rivers to contact###lens fluid . and along the way the biggest viruses got bigger . in , dr . claverie and his colleagues set a new record with megaviruses , a type of giant virus with , 120 genes they discovered in sea###water off the coast of chile . they then dug into the sediment below that sea###water and discovered pandoravirsues , with more than twice as many genes . dr . claverie speculates that pandoraviruses and other giant viruses evolved from free living microbes that branched off from other life several billion###years###ago . the type of cells they may have evolved from may have disappeared , he said . the idea that giant viruses represent separate###branches on the tree of life is a controversial one that many other experts are n't###ready to embrace . they provide no evidence for that notion , so it seems a distraction to me , said t . martin embley , a professor of evolutionary molecular###biology at newcastle###university . despite those reservations , dr . embley and other researchers hail pandoraviruses as an important###discovery . i think it 's wonderful that such crazy and divergent lifeforms continue to be discovered , said tom williams , dr . embley 's colleague at newcastle###university . the new study also drives home the fact that giant viruses are far from rare . shortly after discovering pandoraviruses in sea###floor sediment , dr . claverie and his colleagues found them in water from a lake in australia , 10 , 000 miles away . it definitely indicates that they must not be rare at all , said dr . claverie . giant viruses may be so common , in fact , that they may be hiding###inside of us , too . in a paper published###online on july 2 in the journal of infectious###diseases , french researchers offered evidence that giant viruses dwell in healthy people . they isolated a new giant virus from blood donated by a healthy volunteer , and then found antibodies and other signs of the virus in four other donors . giant viruses may lurk harmlessly in our bodies , invading the amoebae we harbor . whether they can make us sick is an open###question . i do n't believe we have the proof at the moment that these viruses could infect###humans , said dr . claverie . that 's wise advice when it comes to giant viruses .
university###park , tex . more than four years after leaving###office , former president george w . bush has a question for america so what would you have done ? in a new brick and limestone museum , visitors to an interactive theater will be presented with the stark choices that confronted the nation 's 43rd president invade iraq or leave saddam###hussein in power ? deploy federal###troops after hurricane###katrina or rely on local###forces ? bail out wall###street or let the banks fail ? the hypothetical exercise , which includes touch###screens that let users watch videos of advisers before voting on whether they would make the same choices that mr . bush did , revisits the most consequential moments of his administration . in the process , the country is being asked to re evaluate the two term president who presided over some of the most tumultuous###years in the nation 's history . the george w . bush###presidential###library and museum will be officially###dedicated on thursday on the campus of southern###methodist###university in a ceremony that will bring together president###obama and the four living ex presidents . leaving aside for a day the partisan rancor that marked mr . bush 's tenure , they will help celebrate his eight years as president and six as governor of texas . the 250 million complex###houses the 13th official presidential###library , and the third in texas , but it is the first of the ipad era . the exhibits are filled with modern gadgetry and 25 different films and interactive videos . many of the artifacts of the period are on display a butterfly ballot from palm###beach###county , fla . , a replica of mr . bush 's oval###office , the bullhorn he used at ground zero and a gnarled steel beam from the world###trade###center demolished on sept . 11 , 2001 . the museum 's , 000 square###feet of exhibits present the presidency mr . bush intended ( tax###cuts , no child left behind , faith based social###services ) juxtaposed against the presidency he ended up having ( terrorism , war and financial###crisis . large###screens recall the day the towers fell in new york and the invasion of iraq . a glass topped defending###freedom table allows visitors to pull up briefing materials , videos and maps as if on a giant tablet . no president produces a museum known for self flagellation , and mr . bush 's is no exception . it does not ignore controversies like the weapons###of###mass###destruction that were never found in iraq , but it does not dwell on them either . in the iraq display it says flatly , no stockpiles of w.m.d . were found . but then it adds , post###invasion inspections confirmed that saddam###hussein had the capacity to resume production of w.m.d . a six minute introductory video narrated by former secretary of state condoleezza###rice acknowledges disputes over iraq and interrogation###techniques while defending them as efforts to protect the country . if you were in a position of authority on sept . 11 , she says , every day after was sept . 12 . the museum touches on other crises and setbacks as well , including exhibits on hurricane###katrina and the president 's failed social###security initiative . but it also features often overlooked achievements , like the president 's emergency###plan for aids relief , which has treated millions of people with aids in africa , and the creation of the world 's largest marine preserve . the museum itself is the bushes' personal###statement about what they think was important , said mark langdale , president of the george w . bush foundation , who oversaw the construction . but brendan miniter , who managed development of the museum , said that mr . bush wanted the exhibits to avoid editorializing and , for example , insisted that critical letters from troops be included . we try to let it speak for itself , mr . miniter said . mark k . updegrove , director of the lyndon b . johnson presidential###library , said the tone should come as no surprise . it 's unfair for us to assume that an exhibit depicting a president 's administration will be objective when the president is alive , said mr . updegrove , who is working on a book on the father and son bush presidents . but there 's still great value in getting a president 's perspective on his administration . an intriguing aspect of the museum is who is featured and who is not . there is a statue of mr . bush with his father , a section devoted to laura###bush 's travels , a video by his daughters and even statues of the family dogs and cat . in addition to ms . rice , mr . bush 's two chiefs of staff , andrew h . card jr . and joshua b . bolten , also narrate videos . but former vice###president dick###cheney , former defense secretary donald h . rumsfeld and karl###rove , the president 's political###strategist , generally make only cameo appearances in news footage .
piscataway , n.j . two years###ago , paul james could not get a single division i football program to notice him . he spent college signing day in 2011 sitting in class at glassboro high###school , in south###jersey . his coaches worked the phones furiously , hoping for a late break . the fax###machine stayed silent . it really hit me , james said . like , 'wow , i have nothing going for me . ' more than four dozen other prospects from new jersey , including running back savon huggins , signed letters of intent that day , a glut of talent that rutgers helped corral . to james , rutgers officials offered this show up on june , and we will give you a walk on spot . since then , james has replaced huggins as the scarlet###knights' starting running back , and after three astonishing games , he leads the football###bowl###subdivision with 493 rushing###yards , an average of . 1 yards per carry . when rutgers ( 2 1 ) hosts arkansas at high###point###solutions###stadium on saturday , james will receive the bulk of the carries . but he is not the team 's only contributing walk on . michael burton , a fullback , will be blocking for him , in what rutgers believes to be the only nonscholarship starting backfield for a major college in the country . they are the no star tandem , an improbable twosome in an era when recruiters' nets are cast wider and wider . an overlooked talent will occasionally amble onto a roster and emerge as a sensation , as dominique whaley did at oklahoma not long###ago , when he arrived as if borne from a cloud of dust . but in new jersey ? it just shows what we overcame , james said . we both came in as walk ons , and it shows how strong we are to get to this point and how hard we have to work to keep it as is . burton grew up in long valley , n.j. , as a die###hard rutgers fan , attending summer###camps on campus as a high###school junior and senior . but burton , who was an oversize , 220 pound running back , said colleges seemed hesitant . he said he had offers from lower###tier programs like towson , new hampshire and maine but only marginal recruiting interest from his top choice , rutgers . instead , like james , he was extended a lukewarm invitation come to practice , and see if you can stick . there are never any guarantees in life you have to prove yourself every single day , burton , a redshirt###junior , said . i use that as motivation . james and burton were so called preferred walk ons , prospects whom the coaching###staff noticed and liked but did not offer###scholarships . it is not the lowest rung on the college sports ladder , but the ground is mighty close . burton and james began as practice pawns and members of the scout team , often lining up against the first team defense and mimicking what another team might run . they were in the dredges of the team 's depth###chart . but eventually the coaching###staff took notice . we do n't really talk about being walk ons , burton said . we 're out there trying to win games . how did so many programs miss the speedy james , who has six touchdowns in three games ? different players end up in different situations for different reasons , rutgers coach kyle flood said . from what i understand , he had some injury issues his senior year of high###school . i think when coaches see that , they are probably less likely to invest a scholarship at that point in a player . james sustained a high###ankle###sprain in the third quarter of the first game of his senior year , after rushing for , 730 yards for tiny glassboro as a junior . that fall , colleges had begun to show interest tulane , marshall , east###carolina , temple and even penn###state , james 's top choice . but the ankle###injury the next season halted his momentum . he missed two games and then began###losing playing time to corey clement , a talented junior who wound up committing to wisconsin . james 's recruitment fell off . as his senior year kind of ticked away , a lot of those other schools wound up kind of falling off , greg maccarone , the glassboro offensive###coordinator , said . two lower###tier colleges , delaware and james###madison , remained interested in james as a defensive###player , and marshall and east###carolina gave him offers that quickly expired . he hedged , and both scholarships were filled . so james waited until he could not wait any longer . he began###calling colleges and sending tapes , mining for a glimmer of interest . he visited the team closest to home , temple , as well as rutgers that may . greg###schiano , then the coach of the scarlet###knights , told him he could show up in june and have a roster###spot , but nothing else was guaranteed . i could either look at it as an insult or an opportunity to grab , james said . i could get in here and work my way up the food###chain and get to where we want to be . if it all sounds a bit like the movie rudy , james said the thought had entered his mind , too . if you 're a walk on , if you do n't have a scholarship , if you were n't highly###recruited , that 's how people look at you they 'll doubt you , james said . you just ca n't let that get to you .
multinational drug companies now employ more sales###agents in china than they do in the united###states , their largest###market . several , including merck and glaxosmithkline , are making huge scientific investments in the country , including building research and development###centers . within the next few years , china is poised to surpass japan as the world 's second largest pharmaceutical market . the booming chinese demand for drugs could not come at a better time for western manufacturers , whose sales have been slumping because of patent expirations in the united###states and stringent price###controls in europe . but selling pharmaceuticals and other health###care products in china is increasingly fraught with peril , as shown by accusations in china this week that glaxosmithkline funneled payments through travel###agents to doctors , hospitals and government officials to bolster drug sales in the country . chinese officials have compared the company 's operations to organized###crime and have detained four chinese executives for questioning . shortly after government investigators raided the shanghai offices of glaxo last month , the british executive in charge of the company 's chinese operations left the country . he has not been back since . earlier this month , the top manufacturers of infant###formula , including abbott and nestl , lowered their prices in china under government pressure , and chinese officials have said they are investigating the pricing policies of up to 60 foreign and domestic drug companies . the rash of investigations is one measure of how critical the health###care market has become to global###companies and to the chinese government . the chinese have made no secret of their goal of pushing the country 's domestic drug industry into more direct###competition with the world 's top manufacturers . as a result , global###companies can expect more scrutiny , said tarun###khanna , a professor at harvard###business###school who has studied foreign###investment in china . practices that may have been o.k . some time back may be more scrutinized by foreigners now , he said , especially as the government seeks to shift from an export based###economy to one that is also focused on selling to chinese consumers . they 're trying to get more balance back . several factors are contributing to the boom in china , experts said . china 's growing###economy has given rise to a middle###class that is increasingly able to afford expensive western drugs , and to treat conditions like depression

the set , inside the cavernous studio on chelsea###piers in manhattan , is meant to represent the bunkerlike headquarters of a polished chinese techno gangster who has a relationship with the criminal###mastermind raymond reddington , now for murky reasons unknown to both the gangster and the audience aligned with the f.b.i . reddington , the main###character in the coming and much anticipated new nbc drama the blacklist , is , at this moment , wearing a light green short sleeved###shirt and brown walking shorts . he looks more like a u.p.s . delivery###man than the scourge of american law enforcement . then again , it 's only rehearsal , and james###spader has his reddington intensity dialed down to zero , in favor of his normal , real###life mode of free associating bonhomie . that is the quality that comes through in his enthusiasm for this new starring###role the possibilities of this show are limitless , he says , excitement pitched in his voice . anybody can be on the blacklist . ha , ha , ha ! anybody ! no new network drama enters the season with higher###expectations or more pressure than the blacklist . the show has won wide###praise from critics and was the most talked about show during the last development season in hollywood . and , to be blunt , nbc needs a hit . the network has slotted it in the best spot on its schedule , mondays at 10 p.m. , after its top rated show , the voice . a lot is riding on this series and mr . spader 's eye###catching performance . a few minutes after rehearsal , in a gray herringbone suit and vest , hair skimmed close to his scalp , mr . spader is in full reddington mode , jousting with his chinese nemesis with weary disdain , delivering lines of complicated dialogue with precision through 12 long takes . one reason for all the repetition mr . spader 's new co star , megan###boone , who plays reddington 's foil in the series , a young f.b.i . agent named liz keen , is not as sure footed in the scene . of course , ms . boone , perhaps best known for the short lived law###order###los###angeles , has n't been acting in movies , television and theater for 35 years as mr . spader has . would you say spader is kind of an enigma ? ms . boone muses later in her dressing###room . he 's very unexpected . he 's very kind and considerate . but then you also do n't ever feel 100 percent comfortable . all of which makes james###spader the ideal###choice for reddington , a character intended to fascinate and mystify . in the opening###episode , to be shown on monday###night , reddington gives himself up to the f.b.i. , offering to help capture a host of known and unknown supercriminals on just one condition that he work with liz keen , a woman he seemingly has had no prior connection to . even mr . spader does n't want to know too much about the reasons for all that . as long as the show continues to be enigmatic , it has its compulsion , mr . spader said . i need to know a little bit more than the viewer , but i do n't want to know more than that . jon bokenkamp , one of the executive###producers of the blacklist , said that in conversations with another producer , john###fox , they pictured a keyser soze , the mysterious villain of the film the usual###suspects . mr . bokenkamp pointed out that reddington tells the f.b.i. do n't###trust me . everything about me is a lie . the script for the blacklist was , mr . spader says , intriguing in ways that got his attention . it was to be shot in new york , he noted , which he considers home . and then there was that character . there is , he said , his eyes widening with delight , a lot of room for me to move around in there . mr . spader has always been an actor who looks to expand boundaries . his career has ranged from memorable teenagers ( pretty in pink ) to provocative bad###boys ( sex , lies and videotape ) to acclaimed television lawyers . he won###three###emmy###awards for playing the character alan shore in two series , the practice and boston###legal . along the way he acquired a reputation for quirky , idiosyncratic performances of eccentric###characters . now 53 and no longer in possession of the wavy locks that were his early signature , mr . spader remains in demand for more mature quirky , idiosyncratic performances . coming off boston###legal , mr . spader was at loose ends and broke , he said , because he spent all his television money on new households , families , new lives and all that . movies held little appeal , either in roles or compensation . then david###mamet approached him about his play race , slated for a broadway run . mr . spader said yes not a perfect play but a great role for me .
columbia , s.c . most united###states###supreme###court###cases , however significant , pass largely###unnoticed when they are argued . but the opening of hearings over the legal###definition of marriage was a cultural moment that brought america to its front porch . from small prayer vigils in san###diego to rallies in boston , from passover seders to spiritual fasts , the weight of the decision that the nine justices will make was felt in thousands of communities far from washington . here in a state where sodomy was a felony until 2003 and where 78 percent of voters approved a constitutional###ban on same###sex###marriage three years later , about 300 people gathered under a confederate flag that flies at the state capitol . like some others in rallies across the country , they were united in a belief that the cases could lead to profound , positive changes in the way gay men and lesbians are treated under the law . deanne summer , 54 , was one of them . she grew up here , and said she wished more of her gay friends could have shown up for the rally . they were too scared to come , she said . i did n't think i 'd live to see this , she said . but even if they legalize it does n't mean people will accept it . at the same time , others gathered to pray and march in defense of an institution that they believe should be shared only between a man and a woman . the views on marriage are not changing , said dran reese , the president of the salt and light council , a christian group north of san###diego that opposes###same###sex###marriage . she was at a rally at the san###diego courthouse , praying that the supreme###court would uphold what has been the traditional definition of marriage . the other side , they have a little more time and a lot more money , she said . that 's an unfortunate position for us as people of faith . the sheer###number of people who stepped###forward this week to express their opinions spoke to the personal###significance of the issue in a nation that has not been so publicly divided on a social matter since the court ruled on abortion 40 years###ago or , perhaps , since the battle over racial civil###rights before that . folks are coming out either in support or opposition because this is one of the great civil###rights issues of our time , said the rev . angela yarber , pastor at wake###forest baptist church in winston###salem , n.c . on monday###night , she led a prayer service for a group of about 200 people who hope the supreme###court rules in favor of same###sex###marriage . the same night , blessings were given in support of same###sex###marriage at a passover###seder in hamden , conn . at a chinese baptist church in houston , a special call was issued , urging the court to uphold the defense###of###marriage###act and california 's proposition , which limit marriage to a union between a man and a woman . the topic dominated social###media###platforms from the moment people woke up tuesday . good marriage###equality morning ! a new york lawyer who uses amaeryllis as her twitter name greeted her nearly , 000 followers . please remember to pray today as scotus deliberates these very important marriage cases , read the first twitter message of the day from the north###carolina values coalition . holy covenant united###methodist###church in chicago , a small congregation where vegetarian dinners for the homeless are a weekly event , organized a virtual vigil . people were encouraged to take a moment at noon tuesday to pray for a pivotal opportunity for far reaching , lasting###change for l.g.b.t.q . people and their partners . late tuesday###afternoon , a knot of mellow demonstrators with signs and rainbow flags ruffling in the warm breeze gathered on the steps of the california state office###complex in san###francisco . as sea gulls called overhead , they played a mix of songs with lyrics that included , do n't tell me who to kiss . this is our time , said breana hansen , 27 , a graduate###student in international and multicultural###education . we want to show the supreme###court all the people who are going to be affected if they uphold propostion . we 're being heard . billy###ray bradford , who organized the demonstration , said our lives are in the hands of nine people in washington . they hold our relationships , our families and future . they get to make the call on whether our constitution means what it says , equal###protection under the law . a number of those at the vigil said they were not happy about comments made in court tuesday by justice antonin###scalia , who asked , when did it become unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage ? kirk linn degrassi , a dog walker , answered , the right for marriage###equality became a civil right when we signed the constitution .
london arcelormittal may close steel plants in eastern###europe if the european economy continues to slump , the company 's chairman and chief###executive suggested friday as the company posted a net###loss of 345 million for the first three months of . the chairman , lakshmi n . mittal , said during an interview that he expected world demand for steel to grow by 2 percent to 3 percent for the next two to three years . but he added that he was ' 'still worried about the global###economy , especially the european economy . ''demand for steel in the united###states is close to returning to levels before the financial###crisis , while in europe it remains down about 30 percent , he said . the company is ''watching the economic###environment and market conditions'' in eastern###europe , mr . mittal said . if demand remains ' 'muted , '' he said , ''we will look at resetting that footprint . ''arcelormittal , the world 's largest steel company , has drawn fire for closing plants in france and belgium . four of the company 's blast###furnaces in poland and romania are temporarily idled , mr . mittal said . the first quarter loss contrasts with a 92 million profit in the similar period of . sales for the first quarter of 2013 were down 13 percent year to year , to . 8 billion . there were some signs that the company , which relies on demand from heavy###industries like automobile manufacturing and construction , may be reaching the bottom of a several year slide . while steel shipments in the first quarter were down about 6 percent year to year at . 9 million###metric###tons , they rose almost 5 percent compared with the fourth###quarter of . similarly , while sales were down year to year in the first quarter , they were up a modest 2 percent from the last quarter of . mr . mittal said friday that while the results were ' 'still not satisfactory , at least i am starting to see the benefits of the actions we have taken'' to reduce capacity . given the slump in demand in europe , ''we felt that this is not a cyclical but a structural###change , '' he said . ''we needed to take action . ''the closing of operations in europe , especially at li###ge , belgium , and florange , france , has led to tension with governments and unions . the french government last year threatened to nationalize the florange site , but mr . mittal largely held firm on his plans to permanently close blast###furnaces there . the company did say friday that it had begun a new production line at florange for modern , lightweight automotive steel with the trademark usibor . arcelormittal executives say the operating###environment in the americas is much healthier than in europe . louis schorsch , who heads a large part of the american business , said that steel consumption in the united###states was approaching levels last seen before the financial###crisis . demand from the auto###industry , probably the company 's most important customer in the united###states , is ''a good story'' and housing is ''a little better , '' he said , while demand for drill###pipe and other energy related###products is ''a little bit off . ''thomas o'hara , an analyst at citigroup , said in a research note that the company 's reported earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization of . 6 billion was ''a clear beat'' of analysts' expectations by about 200 million . ebitda is the standard earnings measure in the steel industry . arcelormittal , which is based in luxembourg , still looks as if it has a long way to go before it returns to the high profitability it enjoyed before the onset of the global financial###crisis . the company reported net###income of . 4 billion in . ''there is a glut of steel supply globally , '' said jeff largey , an analyst at macquarie in london . ''that is going to prevent a company like arcelormittal from making the type of profits it did in its heyday . ''in europe , where arcelormittal employs more than , 000 people , the company still lost money in the crucial unit that produces flat steel for automakers and other customers . the unit posted a 59 million operating###loss in the first quarter , compared with a loss of 283 million a year earlier and of . 9 billion in the fourth###quarter of , when the company wrote down the value of some of its european businesses . a 210 million gain from selling carbon###emissions credits helped limit the bleeding . steel production at the unit was up slightly from the previous year , but the average price per ton fell by 3 percent to . arcelormittal said it had lost 9 per ton on average on the european flat steel unit . even in mining , where mr . mittal is focusing most of his investment these days , the results were not stellar . operating###income of 286 million was down 19 percent compared with the previous year , although it was up 54 percent compared with the last quarter of .
larry kwong 's career with the rangers lasted a new york minute , but his legacy lingers some 65 years after his debut ended in disappointment . long before jeremy###lin transfixed the n.b.a . and new york###city , kwong was the first player of chinese###descent to appear in the n.h.l . he played for the rangers in one game , for one shift , during the 1947 48 season . i broke the ice a little bit , he said , pointing to the numerous###players of asian ancestry who have since played in the league . maybe being the first chinese player in the n.h.l . gave more of a chance for other chinese boys that play hockey . larry kwong was born in , three years before the rangers came into existence . his journey to the n.h.l . began in vernon , a town in the okanagan###valley of british###columbia . the gold###mines drew his father to canada from china in the 1880s . but he failed to make his fortune and turned to farming , then opened a grocery###store , kwong hing lung . he had 15 children with 2 wives larry was the second youngest . although his surname was eng , he adopted the name of the store , and the family lived above it . the children pitched in after their father died when larry was . they faced other setbacks . under the chinese immigration act of , chinese canadians were denied the vote and other basic rights . we were discriminated against in my own hometown , kwong said in a recent skype video interview . i could n't get a job . the barber would n't cut my hair because i was chinese . he found solace , and his m tier , on the frozen ponds in the woods above vernon . when the temperature dipped below freezing , his brothers would create a rink by dumping water in the empty lot beside the store . larry had to beg his mother to buy his first skates she bought a pair several sizes too big so he could wear them for several winters . his first organized team was the vernon hydrophones in the midget league in the late 1930s . then he moved to the trail###smoke###eaters , who typically provided jobs for the players at the local smelter . kwong was denied employment there because of his ethnicity , so he worked as a hotel bellhop . it leaves a mark on you , he said . you feel that you 're not one of the boys . kwong entered the army and played###hockey as entertainment for the troops during world###war###ii . a rangers scout spotted him , and he impressed the team during a tryout in . he was assigned to the top farm###team , the rovers of the eastern###league , who played their home###games at madison###square###garden , then at 49th street and eighth###avenue . he borrowed a suit and tie from his brothers for the trip to new york . months before jackie###robinson joined the brooklyn dodgers and integrated major###league###baseball , kwong 's presence excited the city 's chinese###americans . before one rovers game , shavey lee , the unofficial mayor of chinatown , and two showgirls from the china doll nightclub honored a blushing kwong at center ice . he was called king kwong and the china###clipper . at 5 feet 6 inches and 145 pounds , with his thick black hair slicked back , kwong was a doodlebug on skates , according to the toronto globe and mail . he thrived under rovers coach freddie metcalfe , centering a line with hub anslow and nick mickoski . one roommate was fred###shero , who later coached the philadelphia###flyers to two stanley###cups . he was very clever and a good skater , said the journalist stan###fischler , who as a child watched kwong with the rovers . he was like yvan###cournoyer , the elusive wing known as the roadrunner , who played for the montreal###canadiens during the 1960s and 1970s . the hall of fame forward jean###beliveau said larry made his wing men look good because he was a great passer . he was doing what a center man is supposed to do . kwong 's promotion to the n.h.l . came as the injury plagued rangers were making their first playoff###run since . he took the train to montreal with ronnie rowe , a rovers teammate who was also called up , and prepared to face off against maurice###richard and doug###harvey . on march , 1948 , kwong slipped on a blue rangers sweater in the locker###room of the montreal###forum , and felt nothing but pride .
it might have been one of the most talked about television events in recent###years james###gandolfini was coming###home to hbo in a new series , his first since his indelible portrayal of the mob###boss tony###soprano on the sopranos . his sudden###death wednesday in italy at 51 has cut###short that tantalizing prospect though there remains a chance that mr . gandolfini 's work in the show , a tense crime thriller called criminal###justice , may yet be seen . it would be just a hint of what might have been , because mr . gandolfini makes only a brief , though arresting , appearance in the show 's pilot , playing a distinctly different character from tony , a shambling lawyer looking for needy clients in jailhouses . friends and colleagues expressed###deep personal sadness on thursday at the death of mr . gandolfini . he was staying at the boscolo exedra roma hotel on wednesday when he experienced a medical###emergency at about 10 p.m . that night , said laura conti , the hotel 's marketing and communication manager . ms . conti said in a statement that hotel personnel notified the emergency###crews , who administered first aid before taking mr . gandolfini to the hospital , where he died of an###apparent###heart###attack . mr . gandolfini was taken to the policlinico umberto i hospital in rome . after additional attempts to revive him , he was pronounced###dead at 11 p.m. , dr . claudio modini , the head of the hospital 's emergency###room , told the associated press . italian law required that an autopsy would be conducted 24 hours after his death , the a.p . said . mr . gandolfini 's death left the creator of the sopranos , david###chase , very emotional , he said . there was a 14 year old boy in there , mr . chase said of the actor . i do n't mean that 's how he behaved , though sometimes he did sometimes he behaved like he was 5 years old , sometimes he behaved like an 85 year old savant . but , he continued , mr . gandolfini exhibited the quality of a boy encountering the world for the first time and it was all starting to come together and it 's not all good news . he added , there was something about his eyes , something in there that you wanted to nurture . when it came to the sopranos , mr . chase said we both sort of got out of that show with our lives . it was a roller###coaster . they worked together again , on not fade away , released last year . calling that collaboration a blessing , mr . chase said that i would have loved to work with him again and again , and that he had a tremendous amount of good work left in him . edie###falco , who memorably played tony 's long###suffering###wife , carmela , issued a statement on thursday , saying she would hold on to the memories of our intense and beautiful time together . the love between tony and carmela was one of the greatest i 've ever known , she said . but those he worked with also expressed###regret for the missed###opportunity to see mr . gandolfini continue what had become a busy career as both performer and producer . mr . gandolfini would have been an executive###producer of criminal###justice , and through his production###company , he leaves behind a batch of other prospective projects , including another hbo drama he might have starred in , big dead place , set in antarctica . his company also sold a script to cbs for a comedy called taxi , which hbo had rejected . on the movie side , mr . gandolfini had only recently###finished working on two still unreleased films for fox###searchlight###pictures . he has a starring###role , opposite julia###louis###dreyfus , in a romantic###comedy , enough said , which was directed by nicole###holofcener and was shot in los###angeles last summer . and he played a supporting###role in animal###rescue , a crime###drama , which was directed by micha l r . roskam , and shot in new york in march and april this year . both films are expected to open in , and neither appears to have needed further production work from mr . gandolfini , angela johnson , a spokeswoman for fox###searchlight , said on thursday .
our theme this week is things that move in unexpected ways . in texas , a rocket flew 800 feet in the air , then traveled sideways for 300 feet before returning to earth . elsewhere , two teams of researchers devised a method for teleporting small bits of information . and a wounded 600 million telescope is like a shopping###cart with a broken wheel , says nasa . onward and upward . the history of space travel is littered with disposable rockets . but the scientists at space###exploration technologies corporation , better known as spacex , have been working to develop one that can land safely and then be used again . in its latest test run , a 10 story rocket known as the grasshopper lifted off and briefly flew sideways , then landed smoothly on the spot from which it came , remaining upright throughout . spacex is still a long way from producing a practical reusable rocket , but the one minute###flight represented a significant###step###forward , and made for the week 's coolest science video . there is an enormous black###hole at the center of the milky###way , and , given its size , scientists have long wondered why it does n't###grow faster and consume more than it does . now , radio astronomers have discovered an elderly , rapidly###rotating star known as a pulsar in the vicinity of the black###hole , called sagittarius a , that is providing some clues , reported nature . by observing the pulsar 's behavior , researchers have deduced that sagittarius a generates a surprisingly strong###magnetic###field that may slow its intake of stellar material . evolution is n't supposed to be predictable . but a common , single tailed microbe , left alone to feed on sugar , consistently produced future###generations with multiple tails that were better suited to eating and reproducing . the experiment , conducted by joao xavier of memorial###sloan###kettering###cancer###center , not only defies conventional###wisdom , it suggests a path for disease research . the microbe in question can cause infections in the lungs , and clues to its behavior could help counter its natural###defenses . two teams of physicists have successfully teleported tiny bits of information from one side of a computer chip to the other , reported national###geographic . the process involved two quantum bits , one on the sender side of the chip , and one on the receiving###end . because the bits were entangled , to use a quantum###physics term , what happened to one happened to the other . so when data was written to the sender side of the chip , it would leap to the receiving side without passing through the space between . the research could potentially improve computing and encryption speeds . the modern melting of the antarctic###ice###sheet may be following a familiar pattern , says a study published in nature . the middle of west###antarctica has warmed by about . 4 degrees fahrenheit since , but east###antarctica has warmed barely at all . the study , based on new ice records , suggests that the same pattern played out during the thaw from earth 's last big ice###age . the ice###sheet over west###antarctica started heating up , 000 to , 000 years###ago , earlier than previously###thought . but east###antarctica , which was higher and colder , was in a deep###freeze until , 000 years###ago . nasa is asking astronomers to help it find a new mission for kepler , the celebrated spacecraft that broke down in may when a wheel that controls its telescope failed . launched in , kepler collected a trove of data as it searched for earthlike planets across the galaxy . that data will keep researchers busy for years , but without that wheel , the telescope is just too wobbly for its intended mission .
back on the prowl mountain###lion , puma , cougar , catamount , painter , panther no matter what you call it , the big###cat is making a comeback . the great###migration began perhaps 40 years###ago . from strongholds in the rocky###mountains and texas , young###males headed###east , seeking female companionship and new places to settle . the emigrants were about seven feet long , nose to tail , and weighed up to 160 pounds . given a dietary choice , they preferred deer , but would eat almost anything that moved elk , bighorn###sheep , wild###horses , beaver , even porcupines . left free for an evening , they were capable of killing a dozen domestic###sheep before dawn , eating their fill and leaving the rest for the buzzards . they were also known to attack humans on occasion . long###ago the inca called them puma , but today though they belong to only one species they have many names . in arizona they are known as mountain lions in florida they are panthers , and elsewhere in the south they are called painters . when they roamed new england , they were called catamounts . in much of the midwest they are known as cougars , and that is the name everyone understands . until relatively recently , they were mainly a memory . all but exterminated east of the rockies by , they were treated as varmints in most western states until the late '60s and could be shot on sight . in maine , the last catamount was killed in . but today puma###concolor is back on the prowl . that is one of the great###success stories in wildlife###conservation , but also a source of concern among biologists and other advocates , for their increasing###numbers make them harder to manage and harder for people to tolerate . no reliable estimate exists for the cougar population at its lowest###point , before the 1970s , but there are now believed to be more than , 000 in north###america . they have recolonized the black###hills of south###dakota , the north###dakota badlands and the pine###ridge country of northwestern nebraska . there are increasing reports of sightings in 11 midwestern states , as well as in arkansas and louisiana . a young###male tripped a trail camera in the missouri ozarks on feb . 2 , and dogs treed one in minnesota in march . every year we see more of them , said mark dowling , a founder of the cougar network , a nonprofit research group and a leading source of online information about cougars . it used to be a rarity when a mountain###lion showed up in missouri . it 's almost routine now . and as cougars migrate eastward , they are likely to wear out their welcome . people in states unaccustomed to these outsize prowlers will have to answer unpleasant questions how many livestock and game animals are people willing to lose ? how dangerous are cougars to pets and children ? how much disruption is a small community willing to endure ? a lot of state conservation agencies are looking into how to prepare for recolonization , said clay nielsen , a wildlife biologist at southern###illinois###university and the director of scientific###research for the cougar network . surveys he conducted in illinois , north###dakota and kentucky found the public more supportive than i would have guessed . but as the big###cats become more plentiful , he added , attitudes are probably going to change . the center of cougar genetic###diversity is in brazil , but the western###hemisphere has six robust subspecies in all . the florida###panther was listed as endangered in , when eight texas female cougars were released in south###florida in a last effort to save them from extinction . it worked . the florida###panther , it turned out , is a north###american cougar whose kinked tails , heart###defects , small litters and short lives were consequences of prolonged inbreeding . from fewer than 30 in , the panther population in southwestern florida has grown to more than . melanie culver , a wildlife geneticist at the university of arizona , says the cougar appears to have evolved about , 000 years###ago from a cheetahlike cat that is now extinct . when europeans arrived in the americas , cougars were everywhere , but human predation and the loss of habitat to agriculture took a heavy toll . dr . nielsen said , by , we had basically killed them all off in the east and midwest . cougars are solitary predators whose hunting ground can vary###widely###in###size , depending on available prey , water###supply and cover . they like woodland and high country , but can handle almost any habitat that offers concealment , including desert ( arizona , swamp ( florida , prairie ( nebraska , temperate rain###forest ( washington###state ) and the pacific###coast . national###park###service biologists tagged a pair of cougar kittens last year near malibu , calif . cougar offspring stay with their mothers up to two years . after that the young###males tend to disperse , partly to avoid other males in their home###territory and partly to lower the odds of inbreeding . after cougars filled up the mountain states and west###texas , the young###males began to travel east . ( females also move , but tend to stay closer to home . ) cougars are not cuddly . jw nuckolls , a rancher in northeastern###wyoming , lost 15 sheep one night to a single cougar , and 32 to cougar predation in two months in . during an aerial###survey at the kofa###national###wildlife###refuge in southwestern arizona in , what looked like three golden###retrievers were spotted on a stone outcrop , recalled susanna henry , the refuge manager . they were cougars probably mother and children . in the following years the population of bighorn###sheep at the refuge began to decline precipitously , from 800 at the turn of the century to 620 in 2003 and 390 in , ms . henry said . since then , the sheep count appears to have stabilized at a bit over . despite their propensity to wreak###havoc on other wildlife and livestock ( they will take on animals up to seven times their own size , including full grown elk , horses and steers , cougars are regarded as a manageable nuisance by ranchers and offered a respect that wolves , the west 's other legendary marauders , can only dream about . there is no easy explanation for this . dr . nielsen noted that europeans had no experience with big###cats when they arrived in the new world , but had long vilified the big###bad###wolf . wolves , he said , had a bad rap . cougar are easier to hunt than wolves and easier to control , he said . cougars run from wolves and will run from barking dogs . hunters use hounds to tree them . they are predictable , while wolves are not . but if cougars are easier to control now , things will change , said harley g . shaw , a retired wildlife biologist for the arizona###game###and###fish###department and an author of a cougar###field guide now in its fourth printing . that time may even be here now . arizona and new mexico deliberately cull cougars to protect their bighorn###sheep , he said , and added most desert bighorn ranges are small and isolated under the best conditions . one or two lions can have a big impact .
whether he was pouring in 13 points in 35 seconds for houston in 2004 or sitting on the bench and watching the san###antonio###spurs win another playoff###game in june without needing him , that cool expression rarely changed . it all looked almost too easy for mcgrady , even if it rarely was . mcgrady announced his retirement from the nba on monday , ending a 16 year career that included two scoring titles , seven all star appearances , injuries to his knee and back and zero playoff###series wins while he was leading the way . the straight from high###school project who blossomed into a dominant , two way superstar will always be remembered , too , as a player who struggled with injuries . thank all of you who have supported me over 16 nba seasons , 7 all stars , and countless exciting moments , mcgrady tweeted on monday###morning . retiring from nba . stay###tuned . mcgrady did n't rule out continuing his career overseas , perhaps in china where he played last season . officially###retired from the nba , he said on espn . door 's still open . mcgrady was drafted by toronto out of high###school in 1997 and was outshined early in his career by raptors star vince###carter , mcgrady 's distant###cousin . he became a star in orlando , was traded to houston in 2004 and also played for the knicks , pistons and hawks before finishing up his career with the spurs last season . he averaged . 6 points , 5.6 rebounds and . 4 assists per game in his career and at one point was considered one of the best perimeter players of his generation , a talent that rivaled kobe###bryant and any other player in the league . congrats to tracy###mcgrady on an awesome career , lebron###james tweeted . 7 time all nba ( 2 1 st team , 2 time scoring champ , and just an all around dazzling talent . the raptors drafted mcgrady ninth overall out of mount###zion academy and spoon fed him early while his body developed to withstand the rigors of the nba . by his third season , mcgrady was averaging . 4 points , 6.3 rebounds and showing all the early signs of becoming a star . he left toronto after that season , joining up with grant###hill in orlando , which is where some of the hard###luck that plagued mcgrady for years first started to surface . there are a lot of things that go into winning in the nba , former rockets coach jeff###van###gundy said in a phone###interview . and until mcgrady 's body betrayed him , he was a dominant player . mcgrady 's body was n't the only one that let him down . hill hardly played in his first two seasons in orlando , leaving mcgrady to carry the load all by himself . he averaged . 8 points per game in the magic 's first round###playoff loss to milwaukee , then scored . 8 per game in a four game loss to charlotte the following season . he delivered his finest individual season in , winning his first scoring###title with . 1 points while averaging . 5 rebounds , 5.5 assists and . 7 steals in a tour de force season that ended , once again , with a first round exit at the hands of the pistons . no matter how brilliantly mcgrady played , he could n't get his teams over the hump in the postseason , and a narrative started to form . after the magic missed the postseason in , mcgrady was traded to the rockets . he enjoyed one of the crowning moments of his career that season when he scored 13 points in 35 seconds to lift the rockets over the spurs in a december game . but more than the scoring prowess , which put mcgrady practically in a class by himself , van###gundy prized his star player for his versatility he was a lock down defender , deft passer and could be a force on the glass . maybe his greatest attribute is he 's one of the best wing passers ever , van###gundy said . great###size , great###skill , incredibly unselfish . he was a multi###dimensional player that unfortunately rarely got the opportunity to play with better teams when he could advance further in the playoffs . ankle problems kept hill from helping mcgrady in orlando , while foot problems for yao###ming spoiled a potentially devastating tandem in houston . mcgrady also had microfracture###surgery on his knee in , which combined with chronic back spasms to limit him to 65 games over the next two seasons . all of a sudden , that effortless athleticism was gone . the rockets made it to the second round in 2009 with both mcgrady and yao on the bench with injuries , only adding fuel to his critics . while mcgrady bowed out in first round after first round , some started to question his work ethic . where was michael###jordan 's competitive fire ? where was bryant 's passion ? how badly did mcgrady really want it ? after a stint with the hawks , mcgrady spent most of last season playing in china until the spurs jettisoned stephen###jackson and asked mcgrady if he was interested in being an insurance policy for them in the playoffs . he played just 31 minutes in six games during san###antonio 's run to the nba###finals . sitting on the bench in san###antonio , surrounded by healthy all star talent for the first time in his career , mcgrady could n't help but wonder what might have been . that 's really the story of my career , mcgrady told grantland in june . what if . what if grant###hill was healthy when we were in orlando and what if the magic would have signed timmy ( duncan ) as well ? what if i was healthy when yao was healthy and when we played a game 7 against the lakers in the second round ? what ifs . that 's what you can put on my career . 'what if tracy###mcgrady 's career . '
ann###arbor , mich . there was tradition in michigan###stadium on saturday###night , even if it was only the second time the university hosted a night game . before the game , michigan honored its past with a legacy jersey , giving the no . 98 of its first heisman###trophy###winner , tom###harmon , to quarterback devin###gardner . his favorite receiver , jeremy gallon , was issued desmond###howard 's no . 21 before the season . wearing the numbers of former greats , the duo hooked up for 184 yards and 3 touchdowns in a 41 30 victory against notre###dame in front of an announced crowd of , 109 , an n.c.a.a . record for a football game . it was the last scheduled###meeting between these teams here for at least the next decade . it was a career performance for each player . gardner , a redshirt###junior , was 21 for 33 passing for 294 yards and 4 touchdowns . he added a touchdown run on the ground , compiling 82 yards on 13 carries . gallon , a fifth year senior , totaled 184 yards and 3 touchdowns , both of which were career###highs . gardner said gallon was like a little bulldog , adding , we 've###worked so hard since i 've got here . we finally got a chance to display it . the fighting###irish controlled the line of scrimmage from the start . michigan scored the first 10 points of the game but could not get any push from its interior line as the irish forced the wolverines to rely on outside pitches and the passing###game . running back fitzgerald toussaint was held to 71 yards on 22 carries . 2 yards per carry . ultimately , it did not matter . gardner and gallon were good enough to make up the difference . in the middle of the second quarter , a pass###interference call in the end###zone gave the wolverines a first and goal on the 2 yard###line . gardner audibled to send his fullback from the backfield to the line , and had to corral a high snap with the play clock winding down . the play was an option . gardner read it perfectly , cutting back behind his offensive###line and into the end###zone to give michigan a 17 10 lead . the wolverines led the rest of the way , although the fighting###irish got to within 4 points in the fourth###quarter thanks in part to gardner 's only major mistake of the game . trying to avoid a safety , he threw a pass directly into the hands of notre###dame defensive###lineman stephon tuitt , who dived on the ball in the end###zone for a touchdown to cut the lead to . kyle brindza made a 40 yard###field###goal on the fighting###irish 's next possession to pull within , 34 30 . it was a horrible decision , gardner said of the interception . i told our defense that if they gave us a place to stand , we would finish the game . i 'm the quarterback . i have to respond to adversity . coming into the game , there were concerns about gardner 's decision###making in his first full season as the starting###quarterback he threw###two###interceptions in michigan 's season###opener , and in this rivalry the team that won the turnover battle had not lost a game since . but gardner made up for that miscue with a long touchdown drive late in the fourth###quarter , capped by a###4 yard scoring pass to drew dileo . that touchdown was made possible by two pass###interference penalties against the fighting###irish , both of which came on third down . it was the 5 foot 8 gallon who was gardner 's favorite target . he finished with eight receptions , a game high . we 've been working with each other since he first got here , gallon said of him and gardner . it 's been a brotherhood between us and we wo n't let anything change that . what does appear to be changing , though , is this rivalry , which is stalled for the foreseeable future after the fighting###irish called an end to the series after the 2014 season . next year 's game will be in south###bend , ind . notre###dame said it faced scheduling conflicts because of its agreement to play five teams from the atlantic###coast###conference , which left the michigan game off the schedule , replaced by a matchup with syracuse . i 'm going back to the michigan teams i coached on as an assistant , michigan coach brady###hoke said . there are just certain games you get very excited about , those rivalry games . i do n't think there was any kind of anger , we just want to win . michigan athletic###director dave brandon said last week that the teams , which first met in , will not meet again in ann###arbor until at least the next decade . in , michigan 's nonconference home###schedule features oregon###state , nevada###las###vegas and brigham young , three programs that have played a combined five games against the wolverines . saturday was the 41 st meeting between notre###dame and michigan , but it is unclear how many more will occur after no . 42 . on saturday , none of that mattered as a record###crowd watched gardner and gallon have career games wearing jerseys of former wolverine greats , adding to an already memorable rivalry , however short lived it may be .
rochester , minn . researchers at a mayo###clinic conference on concussions in hockey called wednesday for a ban on fighting at all levels of the sport , eight days after a montreal###canadiens enforcer was hospitalized because of a fight on opening###night of the n.h.l . season . science has responded to the game on the ice , said ken###dryden , a hall of fame canadiens goalie and a member of the canadian parliament , who spoke at the conference . now it 's time for the game to respond to the science . although no direct###link has been established between fighting in hockey and long###term brain###trauma , pathological studies indicate that fighting could lead to serious brain###damage , the conference organizers said . dr . michael###stuart , a director of the mayo###clinic sports###medicine center and the chief###medical###officer for usa###hockey , cited the opening###night fight in calling for professional and junior###hockey to replace five minute fighting penalties with automatic ejections and suspensions . in that fight , on oct . 1 , montreal 's george###parros was knocked###unconscious after falling face first to the ice . on sept . 22 , buffalo 's corey###tropp sustained a concussion and a broken###jaw in a fight during a preseason###game . you have grown men , standing on skates , punching each other in the head , stuart said . they frequently fall , their helmet may come off , maybe their arms are pinned and the opponent falls on top of them , then their head hits the ice . those forces###acting on the brain are alarmingly high . in , don sanderson , a 21 year old canadian amateur player , died after striking his head on the ice during a fight . medical researchers at the mayo###clinic conference said they believed it was only a matter of time before another player died as a result of a fight . other attendees said the n.h.l . and junior###leagues should drop fighting for liability reasons , as well as health and safety reasons . fighting results in automatic ejections in the n.c.a.a . and in youth hockey in the united###states and canada . but in junior###hockey , players as young as 16 can engage in a fight and return to the game . in professional hockey , a player can engage in two fights in each game without being ejected and can frequently fight without being suspended . in recent###years the n.h.l . has gradually legislated against particular circumstances around fights , and the rate of fighting has slowly dropped , from about one per game in 1991 92 to half that last season . this season , players who remove their helmets to fight will receive an additional two minute###penalty a rule meant to reduce the danger of heads hitting the ice . the league also mandated visors for all incoming players , which could also help deter fights . rule changes that impact and reduce the role of fighting in the game have been , and i expect will continue to be , made over time , as and when they are deemed appropriate , bill daly , the n.h.l . 's deputy###commissioner , said in an e mail . the mandatory visor rule and the rule prohibiting the removal of helmets during fights were two such rules that were implemented just this past summer . i do not expect that we will change our traditional approach to how rules are changed and implemented in the game at any time in the foreseeable future . proponents of fighting argue that it acts as a safety###valve preventing more dangerous acts . they say enforcers play a policing role , helping to deter opponents from putting star players and others at risk . as contorted as the n.h.l . 's arguments always are in terms of responding to concerns about fighting , i think they 're almost at the final point of contortion , dryden told the conference . he said the mounting###evidence about the dangers of brain###trauma that had led the n.h.l . to legislate against checks to the head could soon lead the league to move more meaningfully against fighting . how does one argue against the fact that a blow from the shoulder or a blow from the elbow to the head generates one result , and a blow from the fist does n't ? dryden said . the conference was attended by researchers and hockey officials from across north###america and europe . among the speakers were mark aubry , the chief###medical###officer of the international###ice###hockey###federation and the ottawa###senators' team###doctor , and ann mckee , a boston###university neurologist whose studies of the brains of deceased football and hockey players have broadened knowledge about damage from chronic###traumatic###encephalopathy . the meeting was the mayo###clinic 's second conference dealing with hockey concussions . the first , in , proved###influential in establishing###standards for concussion evaluation and treatment , persuading usa###hockey and hockey###canada to raise the minimum###age for body###checking to 13 from , and broadening concussion education among players , coaches and parents . the 2010 conference also called for a fighting ban in professional and junior###hockey . that call went unheeded .
oxnard , calif . former new york jets offensive###lineman brandon moore backed out of a deal with the dallas###cowboys on wednesday and plans to retire . the 10 year veteran called the team with a change of heart after agreeing to a deal tuesday###night , cowboys coach jason###garrett said . dallas is looking for an experience player at guard because of injuries to both of last year 's starters , nate livings and mackenzy bernadeau . he decided when he woke up this morning that he did n't want to play football anymore , garrett said . so we respect that decision . dallas has been dealing with injuries at guard since training###camp began more than two weeks###ago . livings may not be ready for the season###opener after undergoing arthroscopic###surgery on his right knee for the second time in six months . he missed the start of camp with a cut on his foot . bernadeau strained a hamstring in the pre camp conditioning test and missed almost two weeks . the 33 year old moore played 10 seasons for the jets and started all 16 games for the last eight of those . he became infamous last thanksgiving when jets quarterback mark###sanchez fell down and lost a fumble after running into moore 's backside in a 49 19 loss to new england . moore , who did n't immediately return a message from the ap , told###espn he did n't want to leave his family for the cross###country trip to california . he had ties to dallas through cowboys offensive###coordinator bill callahan , who was the jets' line coach for four years before joining dallas last season . what a tremendous player , jets coach rex###ryan said . he was a great person , a great teammate , a guy that was important to me . being a first time nfl coach , i leaned on him some and he was absolutely tremendous . i guess you ca n't###play this game forever , but i certainly appreciated the time he spent with us , for sure . cowboys owner jerry###jones said the team was looking for a veteran at guard because they plan to start rookie travis frederick at center and possibly another young###player in second year guard ron leary . dallas is still looking after moore 's decision , a sign the team is losing faith in livings and bernadeau just a year after signing both as free###agents . i think the fact that they 're limited , they 've had injury , they 've been out of camp , they were out of the preseason , jones said . i think that you could say yes that had something to do with it . that and the fact we 're relatively young in there . ap sports writer dennis waszak jr . in cortland , n.y. , contributed to this report .
of all those penalized in baseball 's biggest doping###scandal , at least nelson###cruz had a good story to tell . no , his drink was n't spiked with testosterone in a bar one night by a texas###rangers fan desperate for a world###series win . that would be a bit hard to believe now , would n't it ? what really happened was he had this mysterious###illness called helicobacter###pylori , or something like that . hard enough to spell , even harder to prove , but apparently the only known cure for it is to take performance###enhancing###drugs . jhonny###peralta 's story is a bit simpler . he made a mistake , he said , before heading out of detroit to take the rest of the summer off . what 's not to believe ? after all , did n't we believe peralta when he told us back in february i have never used performance###enhancing###drugs . period . anybody who says otherwise is lying . no one , of course , believes anything alex###rodriguez says . not even when he went before the media monday in chicago in a performance that should be required viewing for any young###actors looking to make their mark in hollywood dramas . i 'm a human being , rodriguez said , in what may have been the only truthful thing to come out of his appearance . i 've had two hip surgeries . i 've had two knee###surgeries . i 'm fighting for my life . here 's something you can believe . barring further injury , a rod will be playing third base and batting in the middle of the lineup for the rest of the season , trying his best to help the yankees make a run into the postseason . you have n't seen the last of cruz and peralta , either . their teams are likely to make the playoffs and , if they do , both players are likely to join them when their 50 game suspensions conveniently end . regrets , yes , they have a few . they 'll miss out on some money while gone , and there 's only so much time a guy can spend hanging around the food###court at the local###mall . but if you 're going to miss some games , the dog days of summer have to be the best time to take an enforced break . so go ahead and cheer bud###selig for finally coming to his senses and realizing what drugs have done to the game he 's paid millions to protect . applaud the players who have finally come to their senses and are speaking out against the cheaters who threaten both their jobs and their health . but do n't call what went down monday as one of the great days in the game . do n't believe for a minute that this was a defining###moment in the fight against drug cheats . not when the penalty for juicing is 50 games , or less than a third of a season . not when the player major###league###baseball believes is the worst cheater of them all will still be playing third base for the yankees in the heat of the pennant###race . and certainly not when cruz and peralta become free###agents at the end of the season and half the teams in the big###leagues chase after them with more money than they 've ever made in their careers . baseball likes to tout its drug program as one of the best in sports and , to be fair , it has come a long way from a decade###ago when players could load up on whatever they felt like and not worry about any penalties . but it remains a deeply###flawed system that allows cheaters to remain ahead of the curve for the most part and rewards them even after they 've been caught . blame the players and their union for a lot of it . they fought testing for years and were so powerful that owners did n't###dare challenge them . but blame the owners , too . they made their money and got new stadiums while looking the other way as all those mammoth home###runs soared out of the park . they keep throwing millions at players like bartolo colon and melky###cabrera even after they 've been busted for juicing . nothing will totally to stop doping because the rewards are so great and there will always be those who try . that 's true in many sports but especially baseball , where the money is so big . but here 's a place to start if both owners and players want to show they 're really serious about cracking down make the penalty hurt . fifty###games is a joke , and clearly not a real deterrent . make it a year 's suspension for the first offense , and a lifetime ban if you 're dumb enough to be caught twice . test more . the biggest hole in the baseball drug program is during the offseason , when players face just a one in six chance of being tested . with those odds , why not take the chance of bulking up during the offseason ? void contracts . ryan###braun is losing 3 million for sitting out 65 games this season . think he would be doping if he thought the remainder of the 117 million on his contract could be voided for cheating ? do n't reward juicers . limit new deals for players caught cheating to one year contracts for the mlb minimum . if they play clean for that year , allow them to become free###agents once again . it 's all relatively easy stuff that could be settled over dinner between owners and players if the rhetoric you hear now about everyone wanting a clean game is really true . it wo n't be , because sometimes reality does n't###match the rhetoric . in the meantime , i know a story about helicobacter###pylori that you 'll really find interesting .
she was referring to her falstaffian husband , tom###dempsey , the former n.f.l . kicker born without toes on his right foot who in november 1970 after a long night of drinking and debauchery in the french###quarter of new orleans set the league###record for the longest###field###goal in a regular###season###game . the 63 yard kick lifted the new orleans saints to a 19 17 victory over the detroit###lions , and in the process helped###transform dempsey into a folk###hero in the city hosting the super###bowl on sunday , the rare saints player to hold a prominent n.f.l . record before the sean###payton era . now , dempsey sat recently with his wife at the dining###room###table in the modest , 500 square###foot home they share with their daughter , ashley , and their grandson , dylan , in this new orleans suburb . it quickly became apparent that when reflecting upon his football career , dempsey seemed to take more delight discussing the hits he had delivered than the kicks he had made . he wistfully recalled how , in high###school and college , if his coaches wanted someone on the opposing###team knocked out , they usually called on him to deliver a teeth rattling hit . and his eyes twinkled with glee when he talked about how the coaches he played for over the course of his 10 year n.f.l . career with the saints , the eagles , the rams , the oilers and the bills would sometimes call on him to be the wedge buster football 's version of a kamikaze pilot on kickoffs . i would hit anybody , dempsey boasted , echoing the sentiment of carlene , his wife of more than 40 years . i did n't care . the cruel irony in this is that dempsey 's love of hitting people on the football field may very well be responsible for the syndrome that is slowly depriving him of the hard hitting memories he so delights in sharing . he is suffering from dementia . in a recent interview , carlene was by dempsey 's side to dutifully and lovingly act as fact###checker and blank filler . a couple of times , she prompted him to share a story she knew he would be keen to share . she also did not hesitate to step in and correct him when it appeared his memory was failing him . i went to encinitas high###school , he said at one point . that prompted carlene to say , no , honey , you went to san dieguito high###school in encinitas , remember ? he replied , oh yeah , that 's right . dr . daniel amen , a brain disorder specialist who has done extensive###studies on football players , made the initial###diagnosis of dempsey . he said he was astonished by the amount of damage he noticed in his brain after getting back the results of some scans . i wondered , why does this kicker 's brain look not so good ? amen said in a phone###interview . because i was thinking that kickers should have the best looking brains . but he did n't . what amen later learned is that bygone###era kickers like dempsey , who was listed at 6 feet 2 inches and 255 pounds , did things on the field that are pretty much unheard of today they played other positions on offense and or defense , as dempsey did in high###school and college , not to mention being vital components on special teams units unlike modern kickers , who usually get near a return man only if he manages to get past the 10 other guys on the coverage team , and that is only if the kickoff does not sail out of the end###zone for a touchback . after being kicked off the football###team at palomar###college for punching one of his coaches , dempsey was brought into the n.f.l . by vince###lombardi and the green###bay###packers in the hopes of turning him into a kicker offensive###lineman in the mold of lou###groza . but for the first time in his football life , dempsey was heavily outmatched physically by the famed monsters on the packers' defensive###line . i got beat up pretty###bad every day in practice , said dempsey , who never played a game in a packers uniform . it was then , he says , that he decided , after a stint###playing for a semipro team in massachusetts , that he wanted to focus exclusively on being a kicker . but again , that did not stop him from hitting people on the football field . over the course of his career , the dempseys say , tom had three concussions that were diagnosed , but that several others likely went undiagnosed . they recalled one game in which dempsey , after laying a jarring hit on someone after kicking off , was so disoriented that he ran to the wrong sideline and grabbed a seat on the opposing###team 's bench . he had to be shown back to his place across the field by an equipment manager , and he later returned to the game .
black###nativity , an unapologetically feel good musical about a family 's christmas miracle , is a stark stylistic###departure from kasi lemmons 's signature film as a director , the brooding 1997 indie hit eve 's bayou . but ms . lemmons said that in a weird way the two films are not dissimilar both examine complicated families and belief in things unseen through a child 's perspective . and black###nativity , which opens wednesday , was the movie she needed to make now , as it helped her manage her despair over the loss of a beloved###sister , a blow that had ms . lemmons wondering if she could ever complete the script . within a month of her death , i started###writing , ms . lemmons , 52 , said in a recent interview . because it was 'black###nativity' and had to do with a kid kind of questioning faith , it was the right thing for me to write at that moment . and it saved me . she added i let it uplift me . that question of 'how do you keep having faith ? ' became very real to me . warm and introspective , with a sprightly mass of blond curls that reflect her theatricality , she talked over breakfast at a funky little restaurant at the edge of harlem , the film 's setting . the movie is loosely based on langston###hughes 's 1961 play of the same name , a seasonal tradition that recasts the classic nativity tale with black performers who sing spirituals and hymns like go tell it on the mountain . the movie adds original###songs , like ms . jennifer###hudson 's big number , test of faith . after 17 years on the west###coast , ms . lemmons one of the few black female directors working in hollywood has lived in harlem for the past three and a half years with her husband , the actor vondie###curtis###hall , their teenage###son and daughter , and ms . lemmons 's teenage niece , sky . she took in sky after her older###sister , cheryl lemmons , a doctor , died###of###breast###cancer in . the sisters had been as close as two people could be , she said . ms . lemmons describes herself as more spiritual than religious , but fondly recalls seeing theatrical###performances of black###nativity during her childhood in boston , where she moved from st . louis with her mother after her parents###divorced . i do n't###remember the production but i remember the colors , she said . it was very rousing . it made me happy and emotional . interpretations of the hughes play have varied###widely . her own black###nativity is set in the modern day and stars forest###whitaker as the rev . cornell cobbs angela###bassett as his wife , aretha ms . hudson as their daughter , naima and tyrese###gibson as loot , a streetwise hustler . look for nasir jones , better known as the rapper nas , as the street prophet isaiah and mary j . blige as a ghetto fabulous angel . the story###unfolds from the perspective of langston , played by 17 year old jacob###latimore in his first big film role . langston is the wary son of naima , an embittered single mother , long estranged from her prominent parents . faced with eviction , she puts him on a bus from baltimore to harlem to spend time with the grandparents he has never met , setting into motion accidental meetings , revelations of old secrets and a fantastical dream###sequence of a blessed birth uptown . it is a fast###paced ride , complete with a jubilant church choir and a performance of black###nativity itself in cobbs 's church . all this is a long way away from the louisiana set eve 's bayou and ms . lemmons 's subsequent###films , including the caveman 's valentine and talk to me , which have showcased sometimes tortured characters and featured a lot more sex and ambiguity . she insists that her latest###effort does not signify a change in direction . i look at it and say , 'it 's very me , ' she said . on the other hand , it 's the first movie i 've made that my kids can go see . i 've never made a general audience movie , or a movie with a g rating . some , 000 people a year see a black###nativity production , ms . lemmons pointed out , which affected her approach to the film . i did n't want to make it small and art house , she said . i wanted to make it artful , but i wanted to make it a big experience as it is as a theatrical###production so that you could come to it as a holiday movie and keep coming to it year after year . in an unusually prolific and diverse year for films from black directors , black###nativity ( one of three major holiday films with black casts ) highlights ms . lemmon 's versatility , said mr . whitaker , himself a director and oscar winning actor . she is a filmmaker who has a broad breadth of understanding , he said by telephone . he added kasi 's passionate , she 's very open , she inspires you by creating a family atmosphere on set , and you always feel supported by her . i think she had a great###vision . to do a contemporary###musical with some attachment to the past is unique . ms . bassett , who grew up singing in a church choir , said she immediately agreed when ms . lemmons approached her about the role . i 'm so proud of the work she 's been doing as a writer , as a director , she said during a break in filming this year at st . luke 's episcopal###church in harlem . it 's full of ideas . yet while ms . lemmons is widely###respected , she has made comparatively few films . she chalks that up to being partial to her own scripts ( she said she has written 25 so far ) and concentrating on work she is passionate about . she began as an actress ( and still takes roles , but too many unfulfilling black best friend and black girl###next###door offers led her to try her hand at screenwriting . she unplugged the telephone and wrote eve 's bayou . that got her noticed by major###hollywood###studios , leading to the caveman 's valentine in , a thriller starring samuel l . jackson as a homeless schizophrenic looking to avenge a death . but it was six more years until talk to me , starring don###cheadle as the real###life petey greene , an outspoken black shock###jock . the chance to bring black###nativity to the screen came in , after a pitch from celine rattray , one of the producers . like all of her films , ms . lemmons said , it was shot on a tight###budget ( about 14 million ) in less than 40 days . she envisioned ms . hudson in her role as she wrote the script and joked that she stalked raphael###saadiq until he signed on as the executive music producer . the principal actors sing , and ms . lemmons even shares some songwriting credits on the soundtrack . i 'd like not to take so much time , she said of the gap between her projects . one hundred percent of the time between films i 'm trying to make another film . i might have a script i 'm writing . but the rhythm kind of works for me . she is not disappointed , she said , that she does not have a longer list of credits . i am privileged to have a life in the arts , she said . and i have a family . i feel fortunate i can pull it all off .
washington supporters of the rev . emil j . kapaun , an army###chaplain who died a prisoner in the korean###war , are still working to have him declared a catholic saint for his lifesaving ministrations to them . but for now , they have the satisfaction of seeing him posthumously###awarded the medal###of###honor at the white###house . in an east###room ceremony on thursday , president###obama presented the blue sash and five###pointed###star to an emotional ray kapaun , a nephew . at , the nephew has been alive for less time than his uncle 's comrades have labored to get recognition for their chaplain , who died nearly 62 years###ago , at the age of , in a prisoner###of###war###camp . this is an amazing story , mr . obama said . father kapaun has been called a shepherd in combat###boots . his fellow soldiers who felt his grace and his mercy called him a saint , a blessing from god . today , we bestow another title on him recipient of our nation 's highest###military###decoration . he added , i know one of father kapaun 's comrades spoke for a lot of folks here when he said , 'it 's about time . ' father kapaun was honored for his heroism during combat at unsan , in november 1950 when his unit the third battalion , eighth cavalry regiment , first cavalry division was attacked by chinese###communist forces , according to the citation read###aloud as mr . obama and mr . kapaun stood at attention . the chaplain calmly walked through withering enemy fire and hand###to###hand###combat to provide medical###aid , comforting words or the last rites of the roman###catholic###church to the wounded , the citation said . when he saw a chinese soldier about to execute a wounded###comrade , sgt . first class herbert a . miller , he rushed to push the gun away . mr . miller , now , was at the white###house for the ceremony with other veterans , former prisoners of war and members of the kapaun family . this is the valor we honor today , mr . obama said . an american soldier who did n't fire a gun , but who wielded the mightiest weapon of all , a love for his brothers so pure that he was willing to die so that they might live . at such ceremonies , the president , who wrote a best selling memoir , seems to relish the narrative of a compelling tale . for this one , he went beyond the citation , saying the incredible###story of father kapaun does not end there . since the priest was from a small###town near wichita , kan . , like mr . obama 's grandparents who helped###raise him , i have a sense of the man he was , mr . obama said . he told of how father kapaun carried mr . miller and helped soldiers who faltered on a forced###march to a prisoner###of###war###camp , where the chinese sent them after the attack . through the winter , as the american prisoners froze###to###death , he offered his clothes , sneaked out to bring back grain and cleaned the soldiers' wounds . guards tortured him for his shows of faith , but on easter , father kapaun offered mass in church ruins at the camp as guards looked on . one of the veterans told him , the president said , that the chaplain kept a lot of us alive . the priest had a blood###clot , dysentery and then pneumonia , and in may , guards sent him into isolation , without food or water , to die . as mr . obama recounted , based on testimony from father kapaun 's comrades , the priest looked at the guards and said , forgive them , for they know not what they do . his remains were never recovered . at war 's end , the surviving p.o.w . 's walked out of the camp with a four foot###wooden crucifix they had made in his honor .
manchester , england wayne###rooney scored twice against bayer###leverkusen on tuesday to reach 200 manchester united goals as he enjoys a new lease of life under david###moyes who thinks he can become one of the club 's greatest predators . the striker 's commitment to old trafford had been questioned and he was left out of key games last season under alex###ferguson , who also took to playing him in more of a midfield role as robin###van###persie took the goalscoring glory . rooney is fourth on united 's all time leading###scorers' list , behind bobby###charlton , denis###law ( 237 ) and jack###rowley ( 211 ) and his manager can see him going further . i remember coming in and saying you 've got a real chance to be one of the all time leading###goalscorers at this club and i tell you what if he keeps playing like he did tonight he will get there , moyes told a news conference . along with the rousing reception rooney has been getting from the old trafford crowd , despite a turbulent few months , moyes' faith in him seems to have lifted the england striker 's mood and his game . ferguson had said in may that rooney wanted to leave the club , triggering a close season of speculation over his future and an ultimately###unsuccessful but very public pursuit by chelsea and jose mourinho for his signature . as the rumours swirled , rooney himself never spoke###publicly on the matter and on tuesday when asked about it he was still keen to avoid the issue of whether he wanted to stay or go . listen , i will concentrate on my football as i have done all summer , he told itv after a###4 2 victory over leverkusen in their champions###league opener . i got my head down in the summer , worked###hard and i 'm concentrating on my football . the fans here have been fantastic with me and the reception i get here is great . hopefully i can reward them with goals and performances like tonight . moyes had long said rooney was training well and was in a good frame of mind and slowly###but###surely he has been proven right as the striker deployed in his more traditional role has enjoyed a good start to the season . having been united 's best player in last month 's 0 0 draw with chelsea in the premier###league and having scored from a free###kick in saturday 's 2 0 win###over###crystal###palace , rooney took his performance to a new level against leverkusen . he volleyed in a 22nd minute opener , netted the third with a right footed shot to bring up 200 for united and then passed superbly to assist the fourth scored by antonio###valencia . his goals have come since he started###wearing a headband to protect his forehead after suffering a deep gash and , whether that is a lucky###charm or a mere coincidence , rooney is delighted to have reached another milestone . it 's something i 'm very proud of , i 'm pleased to score 200 goals for a club like manchester united and hopefully there is more to come , he said . i 'm delighted to be back playing and scoring and this was a good result . the first game in the champions###league is always important and thankfully we got the victory . it has taken rooney 406 appearances to notch his double century , meaning he averages nearly a goal a game , and being still only 27 years old , he has time to overtake charlton . it ( the record ) was something we made him aware of , moyes said . more importantly , i wanted to get him back in a good condition and mentally correct when he was ready to play , i think you see ( that , he is moving as well as he has done , he 's in a good place himself at the moment , any centre forward who is scoring###goals feels good about himself . rooney 's latest goals took him to second in united 's champions###league scorers chart , past ryan###giggs . he now has 30 goals , eight shy of ruud###van###nistelrooy 's record tally . leverkusen manager sami hyypia could only watch in awe as rooney tore his side apart . he showed he can score a lot of goals , the former liverpool defender , who knows from his playing###days how hard it is to come up against rooney , told a news conference . he still has a few years left , to score 200 goals is a good achievement ... it looks so easy how he is playing , he showed today he is a quality player .
detroit the ford###motor###company said on wednesday that its net###income improved 15 percent in the first quarter to . 6 billion , as record results in north###america compensated for losses in europe and south###america . two other big automakers , daimler and psa###peugeot###citro###n , said that they expected weak###sales in europe to drag down their profits throughout this year . ford , the nation 's second largest automaker after general###motors , said its overall revenue grew 10 percent in the quarter to . 8 billion , and its market###share continued to increase in the united###states . and despite unsettled economic###conditions in international###markets , the company reiterated forecasts that its full year profit would at least match its performance in . our strong first quarter results provide further proof that our one ford plan continues to deliver , said alan r . mulally , ford 's chief###executive . ford said that strong###sales in its core north###american market propelled the company to its 15th consecutive profitable quarter . the company 's sales in the united###states rose 11 percent in the first three months of this year , compared with a 6 percent increase for the overall industry . in north###america , ford posted a pretax profit of . 4 billion , a 14 percent improvement over the same period a year ago . the company said it was the best quarterly performance since it began###reporting the region as a separate business unit in . the company has steadily rebuilt its product###lineup in recent###years , bringing out new versions of mainstay vehicles like the explorer sport###utility###vehicle and expanding production of smaller , more fuel efficient cars like the focus . but ford , like most other major automakers , continued to struggle overseas in the first quarter . the company reported a pretax loss of 462 million in europe about triple the 149 million it lost in the region in the first quarter of . ford has said it expects to lose up to 2 billion this year in europe , where weak economic###conditions have driven new vehicle###sales to their lowest###level in decades . the company is closing a major assembly plant in belgium and accelerating other cost###cutting in the region . other automakers indicated that troubles in the european economy might depress sales there for some time . daimler , the german maker of mercedes###benz luxury###cars , said wednesday that it was backing off its profit forecast for this year because of conditions in europe . the french carmaker psa###peugeot###citro###n reported that its first quarter sales dropped 10 percent because of weak demand in europe . the company said it hoped to start talks with labor###unions on wages and working###hours in an effort to cut###costs and improve competitiveness . ford 's chief###financial###officer , robert shanks , said in an interview wednesday that despite the sustained slide in european sales , there were some bright###spots in the continent 's economy . we are starting to see some signs that the overall economy may be starting to stabilize , mr . shanks said . auto###sales in the most troubled markets in europe in particular greece , italy , portugal , ireland and spain appear to have hit bottom . some of these markets have flat lined , which is a good thing , he said . before , they were just dropping . while europe continues to drag down ford 's results , the company is pressing ahead with plans to introduce several new vehicles in the region . ford is also coping with a setback in south###america , where it reported a pretax loss of 218 million , after earning a profit of 54 million in the first quarter of last year . the company said currency issues in venezuela and argentina depressed its results , but that it still expected to break even in the region for the entire year . results in asia , where ford is investing###heavily in new factories and products , improved###slightly . the company said it earned a pretax profit of 6 million in the region compared with a 95 million loss a year ago . one analyst said that ford 's overall performance showed that its turnaround was sustainable despite steep losses in europe . as a global company , ford is buffeted by winds affecting each of the world 's major###markets , said jack nerad , an analyst with the auto research site kelley###blue###book . most recently the north###american market has been on the mend and ford has been buoyed by this trend . unlike its domestic rivals general###motors and chrysler , ford was able to survive the recession without a government bailout and a bankruptcy###filing . in recent###years the company has increased the number of models built on global vehicle platforms , which saves money on development###costs . ford is also streamlining production plans to reduce inventories . mr . shanks said that ford expected the united###states car market to continue its recovery this year , with industrywide sales of 15 million to 16 million vehicles . he added that sales of full size pickups appeared to be gaining###momentum because of improved housing starts

new york canadian forward anthony bennett of the university of nevada , las###vegas , was taken with the number one overall pick by the cleveland###cavaliers , setting the tone for a surprising nba draft on thursday . bennett , a versatile 6 foot 8 forward who averaged . 1 points and . 1 rebounds as a freshman last season , jumped over touted centers nerlens###noel of kentucky and ukrainian alex len of maryland to land as top pick by the cavs . injuries to noel ( knee ) and len ( foot ) and others clouded the picture in a draft that was without a consensus number one choice , and bennett himself landed with the 24 58 cavaliers despite undergoing shoulder###surgery at the end of his season . i 'm just as surprised as everybody else , bennett told###reporters at barclays###center , home of the brooklyn###nets . athletic guard victor###oladipo of indiana was taken with the second pick of the first round by the orland magic , and the washington###wizards followed by claiming forward otto porter , who played for nearby georgetown###university , third overall . surreal feeling , man , ' said oladipo . i 've been watching this draft pretty much all my life , and to actually be a part of it and to actually be the no . 2 pick in this draft is truly a blessing . the charlotte###hornets tabbed indiana center cody###zeller with the fourth pick before len was scooped up by the phoenix###suns and noel went to the new orleans pelicans with the next two picks . trade rumors , however , swirled over the proceedings and several players were expected to land with teams other than the ones that selected them . trades had not as yet been made official during the early part of the draft at barclays###center , home of the brooklyn###nets , adding to the suspense . after the top 10 choices were distributed there was a rush toward international players in the draft . new zealander steven###adams out of the university of pittsburgh was taken with the 12th pick by the oklahoma###city###thunder , nba finalists in . poised to become just the third kiwi to play in the nba , the 7 foot adams from rotorua was a freshman at pittsburgh and ranked first on the team in rebounds with . 3 a game and blocks . 0 average ) while averaging . 2 points . three picks later the milwaukee###bucks claimed forward giannis adetokunbo out of filathlitikos ao of greece , a 6 9 forward who at 18 was the youngest###player available in the draft . the boston###celtics used the 16th pick to take brazilian lucas nogueira , a center from estudiantes ( spain , and the atlanta###hawks followed by selecting guard dennis schroeder of phantoms braunschweig of germany . with the 19th pick , the cavaliers chose russian guard sergey karasev of bc triumph lyubertsy , and two choices later the utah###jazz grabbed senegalese center gorgui###dieng of louisville . as for the top pick , the powerfully built bennett was considered one of the best rounded prospects from this year 's draft###class , equally###adept at scoring from down low as he was shooting from the outside . i can contribute at the four , at the three , said the 20 year old bennett . there 's things i still need to work on , but i feel like i 'm a great team###mate , unselfish . i think i can fit in right away .
lead the decision by school officials in the boston suburb of chelsea , mass . , to allow boston###university to manage their troubled schools has left some education experts concerned that the move could erode public supervision of schools . at the same time , educators were intrigued by the idea of a university managing a school system but skeptical that it could be done . the decision by school officials in the boston suburb of chelsea , mass . , to allow boston###university to manage their troubled schools has left some education experts concerned that the move could erode public supervision of schools . at the same time , educators were intrigued by the idea of a university managing a school system but skeptical that it could be done . the criticism and doubts have provoked a sharp response by boston###university . ' 'some of the old guard in the educational###establishment are desperately concerned that we 'll succeed , '' said john###silber , president of boston###university . ''i think those representatives of the educational###establishment who 've sat on the sidelines and watched the destruction of the public###schools ought to wait and see what we can do . '' the chelsea school committee 's decision late last month to enter into a 10 year arrangement with the university awaits the approval of the massachusetts###legislature , which is expected . it would be the first time that an american###university had managed an entire public###school system . roles to be worked out important###parts of the agreement remain to be worked out , including the precise roles of chelsea school###administrators , principals and teachers and whether changes will be needed in union contracts and tenure regulations . albert###shanker , president of the american###federation###of###teachers , whose local represents chelsea teachers , expressed###concern about ''the lack of specificity regarding teacher involvement'' in the proposed effort . but he added that he was not opposed to the agreement in principle . moreover , boston###university and chelsea officials have yet to seek commitments from private and public sources for the additional 2 million a year they say the chelsea schools need to improve the teaching###staff and add programs to the curriculum . 'a noble aspiration' these are among the reasons that several educational experts question the plan . they emphasized that their questions and criticism were not aimed solely at boston###university but applied to the management of a school###district by a university . ''the idea is a noble aspiration but fraught with legal and operational complications , '' said thurston a . atkins , director of the division of education institutions and programs at columbia teachers###college in new york . ''i admire their willingness to try , but i 'm not very confident they can pull it off . '' charles v . willie , professor of education and social###studies at harvard###university , asserted that the undertaking ''has serious implications for the concepts of self###determination and accountability which go to the heart of the development of public education in this country . '' ''boston###university as a private institution with a self perpuating board of trustees is simply not accountable to the citizens of chelsea as a school###board would be , '' mr . willie said . mr . silber asked , ''what is so bizarre about a school of education taking on this challenge ? '' he said his school 's move was no different from medical###schools' providing clinical###services in hospitals or law###schools' running neighborhood legal###service programs , or schools of social work operating neighborhood outreach efforts . peter r . greer , dean of boston###university 's school of education , said the university 's involvement with the chelsea schools would not diminish the school###district 's public###accountability . he said the university was committed to coming up with solutions that could be useful to other school systems . mr . greer , a former superintendent of schools in portland , me . , came to the university in july from his post as a deputy under secretary of the department of education . ''it 's one thing to talk about what universities may not be able to do , '' he said . ''but no one has been rushing to chelsea 's aid up to this point . '' dropout###rate of 52 in fact , dr . bruce g . robinson , chairman of the seven member chelsea school committee , said the committee approached boston###university two years###ago seeking help for the 3 , 300 pupil system , which is beset by severe financial and educational problems . the largely working###class community of 26 , 000 people occupies a 1 . 8 square###mile area on the northern###edge of boston###harbor . the chelsea schools had a dropout###rate of 52 percent last year , the highest in the state . ''we need more money and new cutting###edge methods of attacking the educational problems we face , '' he said . ''we 're still working on many of the details , but the whole community 's excited about this . '' dr . robinson , a 1970 graduate of chelsea high###school , said the school committee and boston###university would work ''in partnership'' in running the schools . he said the school###board would remain involved in setting policy and be accountable to the public . boston###university is one of many colleges and universities in boston and other cities that have long been involved with some public###schools , usually those nearby . a few colleges , like hunter in new york###city , operate their own elementary or secondary###schools open to the public . boston###university and several other boston###area colleges have been working with specific city public###schools for more than a decade , a consequence of the 1974 federal court school desegregation ruling for the city . a 'very mixed record' gary orfield , a political###science professor at the university of chicago , said the boston###area universities involvement with the public###schools presented a ' 'very mixed record . '' ' 'sometimes the connection did n't work because of misunderstandings on both sides , '' he said . ''or school officials were resistant to advice . or it turns out the university###faculty had little practical###advice to give . they may be great theoreticians , but were unable to help teachers with the lesson###plan for the next school week . '' the chelsea agreement is boston###university 's second attempt to gain authority to manage a public###school system . university officials approached the boston school committee twice this decade about managing the city 's 56 , 000 pupil system . boston rejected###offers john nucci , president of the boston school committee , said the committee rejected the offers . mr . nucci , praised the university 's aid to the boston schools but added ''john###silber does n't###understand some fundamental###differences between public education and private education . he does n't###understand you ca n't###pick students for public education . '' mr . nucci said he found it ''ironic that mr . silber , who has continually criticized the boston schools for spending too much money , should now say that among the first thing the chelsea schools need is more money . '' thomas shannon , executive###director of the national###association of school###boards , said he was not very concerned that the governing and accountability of the chelsea district would suffer in the agreement . ''the chelsea school committee is n't handing over the keys to the system and walking away , '' he said . mr . shannon called mr . greer ''an outstanding administrator , '' adding , ''he had an excellent record in portland and has lots of practical ideas . '' 'rub is getting job done' besides , mr . shannon added , the university 's undertaking ''is n't a one man show . '' ''the rub is getting the job done , and getting the job done is clearly going to be very difficult , '' mr . shannon said . ''people are going to be sitting and watching and waiting to see if it works out and why . '' mr . silber agreed , saying , ''it is a moment of truth . '' ''we 're well aware that we might fail , '' he added , ''but we 're not going to just sit on the sidelines and kibbitz . '' he also acknowledged the project 's success would surely enhance the university 's reputation , saying , ''if our school of education ca n't contribute to the success of the chelsea schools , it ought to shut its doors .

detroit last year , ford###motor broke###ranks with other auto companies when it announced major cuts in its troubled european operations , including the closing of three factories , to address a sharp downturn in sales on the continent and an oversupply of vehicles . on tuesday , ford , the second biggest american automaker , behind general###motors , startled the industry again by predicting that europe , a critical market , would get worse before it begins improving later this year . ford said european auto###sales , including commercial###vehicles , could fall as low as 13 million this year , and its own annual###losses in the region could reach 2 billion . europe is ford 's second largest###market , after north###america . the industry did 14 million last year , and that was the worst in 20 years , bob shanks , ford 's chief###financial###officer , said in an interview . but the industry is continuing to decline , and we think 13 million is the trough . the dire predictions for europe overshadowed what were otherwise positive fourth###quarter results , which ford reported on tuesday . the company reported a 54 percent gain in adjusted fourth###quarter profit as strong earnings in north###america compensated for heavy###losses in europe . ford said it earned . 6 billion in the fourth###quarter of 2012 compared with . 03 billion a year earlier , excluding the impact of tax valuation allowances in . those allowances inflated last year 's fourth###quarter net###income to . 6 billion . for the full year , ford said it earned . 67 billion , a 5 percent###drop from . 97 billion in , not including the tax valuation changes , which increased the 2011 earnings to . 2 billion . the auto###market in western###europe remains abysmal , but some analysts agree with ford 's assessment that sales may be close to their low###point and could start to recover late this year as the euro###zone crisis subsides . analysts at goldman###sachs forecast that european auto###sales would fall an additional . 2 percent in , to . 9 million vehicles . but they will rise . 9 percent in , goldman predicted , as car###buyers start to feel more secure about their economic###prospects . in the meantime , though , companies like general###motors' opel unit and psa peugeot citr en are trying to make broad reductions in jobs and production###capacity . the recovery , if it comes , could be too late for many workers and even some of the manufacturers . the companies that have suffered the most are those that depend on the mass###market and on southern###europe , including fiat , peugeot and renault . steady declines in sales since 2007 have left two thirds of european auto plants operating at a loss , goldman###sachs analysts estimated . north###american sales have been a bright###spot for the world 's automakers , and ford is no exception . ford 's overall revenue in the fourth###quarter was . 5 billion , a 5 percent increase from . 6 billion in the same period a year earlier . for all of , revenue was . 3 billion , 1 percent less than . 3 billion in . healthy sales of new vehicles in north###america resulted in good profit###margins , particularly in the united###states , where the overall industry grew 13 percent last year . ford said it had . 87 billion in pretax earnings in north###america during the quarter , a 110 percent increase from 889 million in the fourth###quarter of . for all of , ford had pretax profit of . 34 billion in north###america , compared with . 19 billion in . but the company 's european operations continued to struggle as overall demand plunged , particularly in southern###europe . ford reported a 732 million pretax loss in europe for the fourth###quarter , compared with a 190 million loss in the same period in . for all of , ford said it had a pretax loss of . 75 billion in the region . by comparison , the company reported a loss of 27 million in europe for all of . investors , apparently shaken by the scale of the losses and ford 's dismal forecast for , sent the automaker 's shares down nearly 5 percent to . 14 in tuesday 's trading .
lake###forest , ill . as he exited the scoring area at conway farms golf###club , jason kokrak came upon a group of autograph seekers . he had no illusions about whose signature they coveted . waiting for rory ? he said , referring to the former world no . 1 rory###mcilroy , who played in the group behind kokrak in the first round of the bmw championship . that 's o.k. , kokrak said . i 'll sign . the spectators were thrilled to get his autograph , even if a few had to look at it afterward to see who he was . kokrak may not have the same name recognition as mcilroy , but on thursday he produced the better score , carding a one under 70 to mcilroy 's . like mcilroy , kokrak got off to a sluggish start this season , with one top 70 finish and four missed cuts in his first eight starts . kokrak managed to turn it around this summer while mcilroy , the defending###champion , continues to search in the tall###grass and the sand for his game . in march , kokrak said , he was consumed with worry over making the cut ( and keeping his pga###tour card . how he finds himself six months later contending for a spot in the 30 player tour championship next week is one of the vagaries of golf , in which a player 's fortunes can change with a single highly calibrated swing or stroke . the fortunes of the first round leader , brandt###snedeker , turned on the 13th hole , his third of the day , when he sank a 14 foot###putt for birdie . snedeker , a two time winner on the tour this year , has been uncharacteristically inconsistent on the greens , but suddenly he could not miss . he made six more birdies in succession by draining putts from inside 6 feet and from outside 37 feet on his way to a . after months of attempts by snedeker to iron out his stroke on the greens , something clicked . as described by the players , it is a mystical process , somewhat similar to searching for hours for a missing piece to a puzzle and then discovering it right under your nose . putting has finally got where i want it to , snedeker said . now i 've got to get the ball striking back where it was at the beginning of the year . it 's always a constant###struggle . phil###mickelson knows what snedeker means . he won the british###open with a closing 66 and came up 40 places short at the deutsche###bank###championship after opening with a . a personal###matter that he did not wish to discuss forced him out of the pro am here , which meant he did not see the course for the first time until thursday . he was two over after , then made three consecutive birdies to shoot a 70 and stay in range of snedeker , who is one stroke ahead of zach###johnson and three in front of a group that includes tiger###woods . on one of his swings on the back nine , mickelson said , he hit it exactly the way he wanted to and it clicked . first comes the click , then comes the confidence , said kokrak , whose season turned around on the final day of march , after a five event stretch that saw him miss four cuts and place 79th , when he finished###ninth at the houston###open . just putting yourself in a position where you 're making a run at a tournament , like i did in houston , you 're going to get more confidence , kokrak said . kokrak 's golf spurt came like his growth###spurt without warning and over a few heady months . kokrak , who was born in canada but reared in ohio , was 5 feet 4 inches at the start of his junior year of high###school and 6 feet by the end . his eight extra inches added significant length to his drives . no longer was he a player who had to rely on his short game to shoot a low###score . kokrak did not lose his touch around the greens and this year he is sixth in driving###distance . after playing his way this year out of a wilderness of missed cuts , he is confident that if he stays the course he will score is first victory on tour . in the meantime , his friends who are accountants have informed him that according to their math he needs to finish in the top four this week to qualify for the playoff finale in atlanta . i believe in my game and i believe in what i 'm doing , kokrak said . if he was not so resolute about his midwestern upbringing , kokrak probably could be representing the international team at next month 's president 's cup . he started out with a canadian passport after his canadian###born mother gave###birth to him while visiting her family in ontario . kokrak was a teenager when he obtained his united###states###passport . after that , something just clicked . everything i know is from northeastern###ohio , he said , adding , i do n't think i could ever renounce my u.s . citizenship .
gullane , scotland matthew###fitzpatrick started the british###open being mistaken for tiger###woods' ball carrier on the range . he ended it taking###home a silver###medal for the top amateur and being hailed as the latest prodigy in british golf . fitzpatrick 's birth###certificate says he is 18 but the fresh faced youth did not look out of place as he confidently covered muirfield this week . playing###alongside fred###couples a man nearly three times his age fitzpatrick shot a 1 over 72 on sunday for an overall score of 10 over , beating###fellow amateur and compatriot jimmy mullen by five shots . fitzpatrick says i ca n't###imagine any other amateur event ever being as hard as the course we 've###played this week . he now heads to chicago to play for northwestern .
lake###forest , illinois with his ailing back much improved after a one week###break from the pga###tour , an upbeat tiger###woods will tee off in thursday 's opening round of the bmw championship in pursuit of his sixth win this season . though the american world number one will be competing for the first time on the par 71 layout at conway farms golf###club , he boasts an impressive record in the chicago###area . not only has woods twice clinched the pga###championship at nearby medinah , but he has also visited the winner 's circle on five occasions at cog hill , twice in the bmw championship and three times in its predecessor , the western###open . obviously it 's very different compared to cog hill and medinah , but it is a nice track , woods said of conway farms after playing there in the pro am competition on a muggy wednesday . it 's a little confined in the sense that it 's going to be interesting to see how they 're going to get the gallery around here , especially on the front nine , the bottlenecks over on ( holes ) five and six . all the times i 've been in chicago , it 's a great sporting town . they come out and support their events . this will be a fun crowd . asked by a reporter what he considered as his single greatest###moment in the chicago###area , woods replied probably medinah , winning there twice . when twice pressed to narrow that 'moment' down to just one , woods grinned while replying each time winning there twice . woods heads into the third of the pga###tour 's four lucrative fedexcup playoff events ranked second in the points###standings , behind swede henrik###stenson who took over at the top by winning the deutsche###bank###championship nine days###ago . while woods finished a lowly 65th at the deutsche###bank after closing with a two over 73 in low scoring conditions , he was especially pleased to have the next week off to work on his problem back . that was nice , the 14 times major champion smiled . it was nice to have that week of treatment and strengthening , so that was all good . and i was practicing towards the end of the week . woods had collapsed to his knees in pain with a back spasm on the 13th hole during the final round of the barclays in new jersey , the opening playoff event , forcing him to limit his practice time at the deutsche###bank###championship . with his caddie , joe lacava , having scouted out the conway farms layout earlier this week , woods likes the look of a relatively short course where birdies should be plentiful . we know we 've got some easier holes out there , and if you drive the ball well here , you 're going to have a lot of eight irons on down , and those are some scoring clubs , woods said . there 's a lot of funneling where you can get to some of these pins . you do n't have to fire right at the flag , you can funnel it in there . you can get the ball pretty stiff . the scores are going to be low . woods , who has triumphed a season high five times on the 2013 pga###tour , has been grouped with stenson and masters champion adam scott for the first two rounds at conway farms .

you know this is the wrong one to use . it 's this small thing , but it sets up the fact that walt is this guy who , in every part of his life , is just being kicked around . and that 's not skyler 's intention she 's just trying to keep them afloat . but she 's not a happy person either . so there 's a low###level of deep disappointment and unhappiness between the two of them , and in both of them . not only did walt have all these dreams of becoming this great , successful man , but i think skyler had lots of ideas of becoming a formidable or important person in her own right . i did n't care much for skyler that season . there was this reaction to her in the first couple seasons of why does n't she just leave walt alone ? does n't she understand he 's trying to do this for the family ? because the way the show was set up , walt 's the protagonist , and you know the reasons he 's doing what he 's doing . you continue to root for him . and she is the most consistent block to him . there 's gus###fring and other characters who pose some sort of danger to him , but she 's the one who every day says what are you doing ? you ca n't do those things . she became , in a way , the show 's antagonist through that . was that frustrating for you ? sometimes i would wonder why the audience did n't get a little more of a personal###view into skyler . but i think that was by design . and in the end , it was really smart not to do that , because had people started to think , oh this poor woman , then you would have lost your sympathy for walt . the balance of the show would 've been thrown off . sure , because a key experience for viewers of the show is realizing you 've been rooting for a monster . but skyler 's not exactly innocent , either . bryan and i decided that what made skyler and walt really fall in love , and what was the cement that bonded them , was she 's as smart as he is . so her downfall is really the same thing as his her hubris . she thinks she can fix###things and control an uncontrollable situation though her intellect . she decides , if we 're going to launder money , let 's launder money the right way . they 've both been titillated by power and by the thought that perhaps they can somehow figure this thing out . of course , it 's ridiculous to think that . there are flashbacks in which you see walt as a hotshot researcher . you start to suspect that it was actually the ineffectual nebbish persona that was the phony one . right . this set of circumstances merely revealed what he was all along . and it 's the same for skyler , really . that 's what 's so interesting about the show , in terms of what 's lurking behind people 's personalities . what might be behind the milquetoasty guy you see on the street ? the idea of breaking###bad and what that means in terms of the actions and decisions people make , and why they make them it makes people question themselves in the what would i do ? kind of way . i think that 's the thing that really makes people addicted to the show . five years from now when somebody asks you about breaking###bad , what do you think will be the first thing that pops into your mind ? just that it was one of the luckiest things that ever happened to me .

milwaukee mercifully , the n.b.a . schedule makers banished the nets from new york two nights after the embarrassment of thursday 's shellacking at the hands of the knicks on national###television . the nets traveled to the relative###obscurity of milwaukee on saturday away from the pressing local###news media , heckling fans and the intensifying criticism of coach jason###kidd less than a third of the way into his first season on the job . inside a nearly half empty bmo###harris###bradley###center , the bucks provided###plenty of midwestern hospitality , as the nets ( 6 14 ) grabbed a sorely###needed win , 90 82 , in a battle of the two teams with the worst###records in the eastern###conference . the lowly nets won behind 32 points from a dominant brook###lopez and pulled away from the lowly bucks with a second half spurt . a win is a win at this point for us , johnson said . any win is a good win . it was a sluggish game from the start , every bit an underwhelming affair befitting beleaguered combatants . neither team was sharp , nor did they execute particularly well . but the nets found a rhythm late in the third quarter a quarter that has given them fits this season . leading by 62 59 late in the third , the nets went on a 10 1 run that effectively put the game out of reach . lopez drained a long###jump shot , the defense forced a turnover and johnson hit a free###throw to close the scoring for the quarter . mirza teletovic hit a 3 pointer to open the fourth , reggie###evans made a layup and andray###blatche hit two free throws . suddenly , the nets were ahead , 72 60 . the 7 foot lopez was a force from the opening tip . he made his first six shots and had 20 points at halftime , nailing an array of jump shots and layups . playing without caron###butler and zaza###pachulia , milwaukee was powerless to stop lopez as he backed his way to the basket at will . he shot 11 for 13 from the field and 10 for 11 from the free###throw line . i got good looks from my guards and i just tried to take my time in the post and really read what they were doing , lopez said . kidd said the deliberate offense was a key to the game plan . we 're going to slow it down , we 're going to try and get the ball inside , he said . we 're not a team that 's going to zoom up and down the court and score 110 points every night . the nets entered the game last in the league in defensive efficiency , allowing . 8 points per 100 possessions , but they proved sturdy against the bucks . on thursday , the knicks shot 16 for 27 from 3 point range and scored 113 points the bucks shot only 7 for 20 from long###distance . we talked on defense , anderson said . whether it was the right talk or the wrong talk , we talked . he added sometimes i think we get out of sync and we start depending on joe or brook . today , we moved the ball . we played together on defense and offense . again , the nets were without several key###contributors deron###williams , jason###terry , paul###pierce and andrei###kirilenko . but against this opponent , it did not matter . kidd shook up his lineup , starting shaun###livingston at point###guard instead of tyshawn###taylor . neither , though , provided much of a spark , a sign of how badly the nets miss williams , who plans to return tuesday###night when the nets host the boston###celtics . still , the bucks ( 4 16 ) turned out to be the perfect tonic for the nets' flagging confidence during a nightmarish and injury plagued first six weeks of the season . the bucks entered the game as the only team looking up at the nets in the eastern###conference standings , and won a grueling overtime###game friday###night in washington . on saturday , the bucks built a 40 39 lead at halftime , but they faded in the second half . before the game , kidd struck an optimistic tone about what has been a trying stretch for him . this is a veteran club , he said . we understand that we have n't played our best basketball . when you look at our division , we 're two games out . so there are some positive###things to look at . now the nets return###home , where disgruntled fans await . but with the win and the return of their star point###guard , perhaps better days lie ahead . we got to get a much needed win at home , kidd said . we have n't won there in a very long time . jason###terry , out since nov . 20 with left knee soreness , will be re evaluated monday . ... paul###pierce , recovering from a non displaced fracture in his right hand , traveled with the team and worked out saturday###afternoon .
london depending on where one stands in the debate on the rising cost of housing in britain , paul thomas and abigail walker , first time home###buyers , are either part of the solution or part of the problem . to buy a , 000 , or , 000 , two bedroom house in oxfordshire , west of london , mr . thomas , a 38 year old electrician , and his 25 year old partner , ms . walker , who works in an accounting office , are making use of a government program called help to buy . through it , they are able to make a down payment of only 5 percent from their own funds , with the government giving them an interest free loan to cover the other 20 percent of the deposit . the government of prime###minister david###cameron has cast the program as a way to stimulate the country 's sluggish economy by helping consumers skeptics might refer to them as voters buy###homes they could not otherwise afford . but critics say it could lead to a housing###bubble and a spate of problem loans on which the government could be left to make good . under help to buy , rolled out in march , the government either offers interest free credit or guarantees part of the property loan . the resulting higher###demand for homes is supposed to fuel construction and aid the economic###recovery . help to buy is a dramatic intervention to get our housing###market moving , george###osborne , the chancellor of the exchequer , told parliament in presenting the plan . that is a good use of this government 's fiscal credibility . but over the last month , the program has drawn a growing outcry from some lawmakers and economists , demanding an early end for help to buy . they note that the housing###market has already been picking up and warn that the plan could create a housing###bubble that would be likely to burst when the program expires in , while driving price increases that will make homes even less affordable for many in the meantime . as evidence , they cite a report this month by the government statistical###office that indicated that house price inflation had risen in june at annual###rate of . 1 percent , up from . 9 percent in may , bringing prices to the highest###level in five years . albert edwards , an outspoken strategist at soci###t###g###n###rale in london , called the british plan madness and truly moronic , saying that buyers need cheaper homes , not greater###availability of debt to inflate house###prices even further . critics also question the wisdom of enabling people to get a mortgage with a down payment of as little as 5 percent of the home value at a time when lenders are under pressure from regulators to reduce the riskiness of loans . it also means that britain is increasing support to the housing###sector just as the united###states is seeking###ways to reduce the government 's role and risk in the mortgage market . this month , president###barack###obama proposed winding down fannie###mae and freddie###mac , the two giant government backed mortgage finance companies . we do not want what the u.s . has , which is a government guaranteed mortgage market , and they are desperately trying to find a way out of that position , mervyn a . king told sky###news in an interview a month before he retired in july as the bank of england governor . the international###monetary###fund warned in may that help to buy would push###up house###prices if the government does not ensure that more houses are built . fitch , the debt ratings agency , has raised similar###concerns . the plan as announced in march by mr . osborne came in two parts . the first piece , in place since april , is limited to the purchase of newly###built homes . the government offers a five year interest free loan worth 20 percent of the home value to help pay the deposit . mr . thomas and ms . walker are getting help through that portion of the program . the second and more controversial part of the plan , which is due to start in january , allows the buyers of any house to pay only 5 percent of the value of the home as a deposit . the government would then guarantee an additional 20 percent of the bank loan for any property worth as much as , 000 , effectively passing the risk from the lender to the government . using the government 's balance###sheet to back these higher loan to value mortgages will dramatically increase their availability , mr . osborne said when he presented the plan to parliament in march . mr . thomas and ms . walker had recently###moved in with ms . walker 's mother in oxfordshire to save###money for a deposit , which they said would have taken them 10 years to come up with on their own .
over the course of his prominent career , the german composer karlheinz###stockhausen took on myriad guises . to the european postwar establishment , he was an enfant###terrible , embracing the objective rigor of total serialism and the uncharted vistas of electronic###music and happenings . for adventurous jazz and rock musicians like miles###davis , the beatles and frank###zappa , he was a promethean figure who delivered unto the world techniques for fashioning mind altering sounds . from the '80s onward , as stockhausen obsessively devoted his time and labor to the seven day opera cycle licht ( light ) and the 24 part series klang ( sound , he was a mystic and a narcissist , making eccentric , unrealistic demands a string###quartet for players aloft in four separate helicopters , for example . that he might have lost his grip on reality altogether seemed possible when , in , he referred to the sept . 11 attacks as the greatest work of art that is possible in the whole cosmos a statement taken out of context , he strenuously insisted . now , just over five years after his death and with an acclaimed staging of michaels reise um###die erde ( michael 's journey around the world , the second act of the opera donnerstag aus###licht ( thursday from light , opening at the lincoln###center festival on thursday stockhausen appears to have assumed his least likely status of all surefire box###office hit . he was always the one composer who was the icon of contemporary###music , said thomas oesterdiekhoff , the chief###executive director of ensemble musikfabrik , the german new music group that is mounting michaels reise um###die erde in its north###american###premiere . contemporary###music has become a standard part of normal concert life , he asserted , so audiences naturally are drawn to stockhausen . if they want to know something new , they can get it now through stockhausen , he said . certainly , nothing fundamental has changed about compositions like gruppen , the complex work for three orchestras mounted by the new york philharmonic and the park###avenue###armory in , or the electronic piece oktophonie , a segment of dienstag aus###licht ( tuesday from light , presented by the armory in march . but the philharmonic concerts sold out , and the armory had to add###extra performances of oktophonie to satisfy the demand for tickets . even before those large###scale , attention###grabbing productions , a stockhausen boomlet was under way in new york . stimmung , a 1968 vocal work , mesmerized an audience at 30 a.m . during the 2008 bang on a can marathon , held just yards away from ground zero . and the grass roots concert organizers of darmstadt classics of the avant###garde attracted capacity audiences to the issue project room in brooklyn with seminal older###works like gesang der j nglinge and kontakte in , and with the new york premiere of cosmic pulses ( from klang ) in . the phenomenon is not limited to new york . a 2012 birmingham opera###company production of the opera mittwoch aus###licht ( wednesday from light , including the notorious helicopter string###quartet , earned a prestigious###award from the royal###philharmonic###society . at the same time , musikfabrik has successfully mounted michaels reise in vienna , cologne , dresden , warsaw , venice and paris . speaking by telephone from cologne , where musikfabrik was presenting stockhausen 's samstag aus###licht ( saturday from light ) with the bavarian###radio###symphony###orchestra , mr . oesterdiekhoff said that the composer 's death emboldened some institutions previously reluctant to take on his works . when he was alive , to be honest , he was quite demanding , he said . there were a lot of presenters who were really afraid of stockhausen , because , they said , when we want to do something by stockhausen , it will cost a fortune , and that will be our ruin . ensembles and institutions are willing to offer interpretations that might deviate from the composer 's explicit intentions , mr . oesterdiekhoff said , adding , now , people are more free to do it in the way they think it should be done . after musikfabrik introduced an elaborate , appealing staging of michaels reise produced by the vienna taschenoper and directed by carlus padrissa of the innovative catalan street theater company la###fura###dels###baus , in 2008 the group went on to mount the first complete traversal of klang in , then joined opera cologne in the world###premiere of sonntag aus###licht ( sunday from light ) in . after that , everything is now workable , everything is possible and accessible , mr . oesterdiekhoff said . he added that while the two musicians who manage stockhausen 's legacy , kathinka pasveer and suzanne stephens , do n't###agree with every interpretive departure , they have eagerly cooperated in the promulgation of his works and even performed with musikfabrik in some instances . of course , accessible is a relative term when it comes to stockhausen , in whose operas sacred , mundane , autobiographical and absurd elements collide . the wholly instrumental michaels reise concerns a voyage of discovery undertaken by the angel michael , one of three characters featured throughout licht . the others are the rebel angel lucifer and the earth mother eve . all come from the urantia book , a volume of quasi christian###mysticism that stockhausen said he bought from a mysterious###stranger after the composer conducted the new york philharmonic at avery###fisher###hall in . effectively a staged concerto in which the trumpeter marco blaauw portrays michael while suspended from a crane onstage , michaels reise is saturated with mystery , whimsy , eros and spirituality elements echoed in mr . padrissa 's imaginative stage conception . the lincoln###center festival director nigel redden , who was inspired to bring the work to new york after seeing musikfabrik 's collaboration with mr . padrissa in sonntag aus###licht in cologne , said that a mix of spirituality and absurdity is a key aspect of stockhausen 's work . there 's almost a ridiculous aspect to some of the requirements , and somehow that is also part of what makes these performances extremely###strong , mr . redden said . they could become pretentious if they did n't have this element of the absurd . inviting audience members to embrace stockhausen 's conceits , he said , lincoln###center is encouraging those attending michaels reise to wear###bright blue , designated by the composer as the exoteric color of donnerstag aus###licht .
( reuters ) the cleveland###indians recorded their fifth straight###victory with a 6 5 triumph over the kansas###city###royals on tuesday to maintain a slim advantaged at the top of the american###league###central division . cleveland blew a###4 0 lead when the royals put up four runs in the fifth inning to tie the contest but the visitors recovered their composure to emerge with the win . catcher carlos###santana hit a go ahead sacrifice###fly in the seventh , in which jason giambi also had an rbi , and the indians held on down the stretch . the victory kept them half a game ahead of detroit in the division race after the tigers won 7 6 in toronto . miguel###cabrera smashed a three run home###run for detroit , his 26th of the season , while toronto 's colby###rasmus had a homer and four rbis . in pittsburgh , philadelphia prevailed 3 1 over the major###league leading pirates to snap their nine###game###winning###streak . st###louis remained two games behind the pirates in the nl central , however , after they lost 5 1 to the angels in los###angeles . albert###pujols faced the cardinals for the first time since leaving to sign with the angels after the 2011 season and went 0 for , though los###angeles still won their seventh###straight game . in oakland , the athletics defeated the chicago###cubs 8 7 to take over first place in the al west . with his team trailing 7 5 in the eighth , derek###norris slugged a three run homer to provide the difference for the a 's and texas lost 9 2 to seattle to fall half a game behind . it was a busy day for the chicago###cubs , who made a pair of trades that sent pitchers to team 's trying to push for the playoffs . the baltimore###orioles acquired starter scott###feldman along with backup###catcher steve clevenger from the cubs in exchange for reliever pedro###strop , starter jake###arrieta and financial###considerations . meanwhile , the dodgers acquired struggling reliever carlos marmol from the cubs in a deal that saw los###angeles send over reliever matt###guerrier . marmol had fallen out of favor with chicago and was designated###for###assignment last month . los###angeles also receive financial###considerations in the deal .
washington with the government reopened and a debt default averted for now , congressional negotiators on thursday plunged into difficult budget talks to avoid a repeat crisis within months , and quickly agreed to lower their sights from the sort of grand bargain that has eluded the two parties for three years . after approval late wednesday of the agreement ending the standoff , the deal making mantle shifted overnight from the leaders of the senate to the budget###committee leaders , senator patty###murray , democrat of washington , and representative paul d . ryan , republican of wisconsin , two less senior lawmakers who nonetheless could make very effective salespeople since they command loyal followings in their parties . the political pressure lifted as well , for now . but the need for a bipartisan breakthrough , even a modest one , was amplified by the economic###costs wrought by the 16 day shutdown and near default on government obligations . the key now is a budget that cuts out the things that we do n't need , closes corporate###tax loopholes that do n't help create###jobs , and frees up resources for the things that do help us grow like education and infrastructure and research , president###obama said thursday from the white###house , setting ambitious goals for congress even as his own role in the bargaining was unclear . the question of what a new house senate budget conference can deliver by its dec . 13 deadline in time for congress to act by jan . 15 on funding to keep the government open remained the subject of deep skepticism , well earned by past failures at reaching so called grand bargains for deficit###reduction and spending investments in the past three years . with the scope of the talks narrowed for now , on the table are ideas left over from past , failed bargaining possible reductions in other programs like farm subsidies , federal pensions , the postal###service and unemployment###insurance and relatively minimal tax loophole closings , possibly as little as 55 billion . while there is nonetheless hope on both sides for a defining budget deal , the three week budget###crisis scrambled washington 's power structure . democrats , united throughout , believe they enter this next round far stronger , backed by a president who proved his own resolve . republicans , having played their trump card by shutting down the government , are weakened and more divided than ever . reflecting his party 's chastened state heading into the next phase , senator mitch###mcconnell of kentucky , the republican leader , told the conservative national###review on thursday , a government###shutdown is off the table . even so , republicans enter these new talks with one advantage if the negotiations fail , the next round of across the board spending###cuts known as sequestration will hit automatically , even deeper than the first . democrats want to avoid that far more than republicans do . our goal is to do good for the american people , to get our debt under control , to do smart deficit###reduction , and to do things we think can grow the economy and get people back to work , mr . ryan said . ms . murray said , we believe there is common###ground . by definition , common###ground suggests no grand bargain , which would require a much more difficult trade off where they fundamentally differ higher###tax revenues that republicans oppose , in exchange for reductions in medicare , medicaid and social###security that democrats vow they will not entertain without curbs on tax###breaks for wealthy###individuals and corporations . with the last minute settlement , washington found itself battered , exhausted and about where it was back in march in terms of budget progress . that month , congressional republicans and the white###house failed to prevent the sequestration cuts from taking###effect across military and domestic programs . the republican led house and democratic controlled###senate passed vastly different budgets , but republicans blocked democrats' repeated###efforts to convene a conference###committee to reconcile the differences until this week . congress not only reopened the government through jan . 15 and raised the nation 's borrowing limit effective to feb . 7 on wednesday . it also mandated the formal budget negotiations in a separate parliamentary motion . nobody can guarantee success , but what we can say is that if we do n't make the effort and get together and talk , that would guarantee failure , said representative chris###van###hollen of maryland , house democrats' chief###negotiator . to improve the prospects for some success , the negotiators largely agreed at a closed###door breakfast on thursday that a deal###involving significant new tax###revenues and large###scale changes to medicare , medicaid and social###security , whose growth in an aging###population is driving long###term projections of growing debt , is not going to happen . instead , they agreed , the talks will aim at a more modest , confidence###building measure to replace the sequestration cuts in . negotiators could aim higher , for a deal saving at least 1 trillion over the next nine years to substitute completely for the arbitrary sequestration cuts . but neither side was hopeful of that . even with lower sights , negotiators face the same hurdle over taxes that has ended a series of bipartisan talks in 2011 between mr . obama and speaker john a . boehner between vice###president joseph r . biden jr . and representative eric###cantor , the house###majority###leader and between lawmakers on a so called supercommittee . the old bugaboo that has made other conferences fail is revenues , said senator charles e . schumer of new york , the no . 3 democrat . tea###party infused lawmakers seemed unbowed and still uncompromising despite their loss over the debt limit and government funding for the fiscal year that began oct . 1 . so did the conservative groups like club for growth and heritage action that goaded them on . like the congressional actors , the white###house is not expecting a grand bargain , as much as mr . obama and mr . boehner , for that matter would like to have that as a legacy . but it is determined to see an end to sequestration , and is counting on the cooperation of republican leaders since the military is in line for greater automatic reductions than domestic programs in january . rank and file republican###lawmakers and the party base , however , have come to see sequestration as a victory . by his televised remarks at the white###house , mr . obama sought to project a tone of compromise , aides said , though some republicans heard some partisan gloating . he also described a budget goal more expansive than the congressional negotiators are setting , but one that neither party 's leaders rule out . this should n't be as difficult as it 's been in past years because we already spend less than we did a few years###ago , mr . obama said . our deficits are half of what they were a few years###ago . the debt problems we have now are long###term , and we can address them without shortchanging our kids , or shortchanging our grandkids , or weakening the security that current generations have earned from their hard work .
memphis , tenn . phil###mickelson has spent so much time honing his swing for the u.s . open that he 's finding he needs to tweak his short game too . mickelson wound up two putting 10 holes thursday on his way to a 71 that left put him five strokes back of the lead at the st . jude classic . i probably spent so much time on swing and getting sharp tee to green because of the u.s . open and the difficulty there that i 'm hitting it as well as i have in quite a long time , mickelson said . short game ... it has n't been bad but today it was not good . davis###love###iii shot a###4 under 66 for his best round of the year thursday for a share of the lead with five other players after the first round of the final###event before the open next week at merion in ardmore , pa . stuart###appleby , harris###english , nathan green , martin flores and glen day also shared the lead on a day where at least three others had a piece of the top spot lead at some point . this is the first lead after any round on tour for flores and english . defending champ dustin###johnson was 5 under through six holes , taking advantage of near perfect conditions at the tpc southwind with a temperature in the low 80s and only a slight breeze early . he johnson finished with a 67 and was tied with 10 others including david###toms , a two time winner here , and shawn stefani , who was tied for the lead before he hit into a fairway bunker and bogeyed no . 18 . nobody could go lower than 5 under with the firm bermuda grass greens keeping players from stopping the ball where they want , especially when chipping . greens were perfect , but it seems like it 's just tough to get the ball close to the hole , toms said . so you really have to take advantage of those shots that are shorter where you can attack . some long shots where the ball releases and it 's just tough to get it close . this was mickelson 's first competitive round missing the cut at the players###championship a month ago . but he was at merion on monday and tuesday , and he said he feels he has a good round coming . and he also plans to use his putter rather than trying to chip from off the green . i hit some pathetic chips out there , then i kind of learned that you just have to putt it , mickelson said . i putted it from off the green and got those up and down no problem . brandt###snedeker , currently no . 6 in the world , opened with a . boo###weekley , who won at colonial , shot a 68 and was tied with seven others . love took off in february for surgery to relieve numbness and weakness

excited to be back , and i 'm anxious and i want to play better than i 'm playing . i 'm a little bit tired from the two 36 hole qualifiers as well . you got to be a little bit more patient and polished . that 's going to take some rounds of golf to get back . appleby also had his best round this year . the australian with nine victories has n't won since the greenbrier###classic in , and

if you believe in awards , you believe in importance , in hierarchies , in arcs of triumph that take you from the bottom to the top . an award says you matter . an awards show is not only a celebration of excellence , but also of people who believe in the system . for the most part , that is . the first youtube###music###awards , which took place sunday###evening at pier 36 in manhattan and was streamed###live on youtube . com , was something different . this was a show of essentially no importance , but also one that effectively embraced the values of the post hierarchical creative ecosystem of the internet a theoretically equal playing###field , risk taking , resilience in the face of failure , evanescence . that made for an often inexplicable but surprisingly easy to watch jumble of live performances called live music###videos here award presentations and barely there comedy###sketches . hosted by the comedian musicians jason###schwartzman and reggie###watts , the show , which ran just under an hour and a half , had a distinctly no fi aesthetic , with visible stagehands and with disruptions to the typical orderliness of awards shows woven into its structure . the obvious touchstones were the early , less predictable iterations of mtv 's###video music###awards , but that always wanted to be a prestige event it wanted to sit next to , then unseat , the grammys , validating the music###video along the way . this show had no such agenda music###videos thrive on youtube , and the internet is ubiquitous . and so it drew influences less linearly from the public###access experimentation of tv party , from special###effects heavy cinema , from the circus and from elementary###school talent shows . anywhere , in other words , where people are inventing new experiences as they go along . but youtube is owned by google , and google has a market###capitalization of about 340 billion , which means that this was a counter professional production put on by complete pros . in charge was spike###jonze , who served as the event 's creative###director and directed some of the segments . the preshow emphasized the spit and glue ness of it all . the whole spirit of this thing is to be in over your head , said mr . schwartzman , who a few minutes into the live broadcast reassured viewers , i 've never hosted anything in my life . what a relief that turned out to be . flat , scripted banter was replaced by flat , unscripted banter . he and mr . watts were frisky and mumbling , not plastic . their bafflement and meandering were genuine , and often appealing . somewhere in this miasma , there were awards ( voted on by fans . getting little red###bricks with a play arrow on them were eminem for artist of the year the k###pop phalanx girls' generation for video of the year for i got a boy macklemore###ryan###lewis for youtube breakthrough taylor###swift 's i knew you were trouble for youtube phenomenon , whose award was accepted by cimorelli , a group of sisters whose youtube covers have been extremely###popular . their speech was interrupted by win###butler of arcade fire , kanye###west style , to insist that the real winner should have been baauer 's harlem###shake , which was true , so much as anything hewed to logic . the easiest to consume performances were from the most established and least experimental artists , lady###gaga and eminem , both of whom were taut and focused . there was an implied tension between the need for bankable names like these all of whom conveniently have new albums to promote , and who likely hitched their wagon to whichever awards show was available and youtube 's implicit mission of supporting bootstrapping self made creator curios like the new age meets dubstep violinist lindsey###stirling ( who won the award for response of the year for a collaboration with pentatonix . both types excel in the form , but they have next to nothing in common . directors fafi , chris###milk , mr . jonze and more were given almost equal billing to the stars they were working with . the medley part of the show say , akin to what billy###crystal does at the oscars , or neil###patrick###harris does on awards shows and possibly on street###corners was left to a youtube friendly comedy band , cdza , with cameos from tay###zonday , of chocolate rain fame , punching up and looking great , and t###pain , of regular fame , punching down and looking lost . in keeping with the show 's ragged spontaneity , it was at times troubled by technical glitches . about midway through , the live stream froze repeatedly , making parts of the presentation unviewable ( including , frustratingly , the performance in a cramped pink room by tyler , the creator with earl###sweatshirt , which looked like a riot , at least in the two second snippets that eked through . what 's more , every time the stream had to be restarted , it was preceded by a 30 second kia ad starring those damned driving hamsters . i watched it about eight times . unlike###regular videos on youtube , neither the stream of the awards show nor the preshow would play on my smart###tv , even though it comes equipped with a youtube app . ( according to a google spokeswoman , youtube live###streaming is only compatible with google###tv or chromecast . ) but mr . jonze did n't###control the wires and pipes , only what was shot through them . he used the event as an excuse to line the coffers of the indie mafia lena###dunham wrote a goofy choose your own adventure script synced to an avicii song , greta###gerwig herked and jerked her way through her frances###ha dances as arcade fire performed , and rashida###jones dropped babies off with the hosts , then disappeared . whether it was worth everyone 's time well , that 's still to be determined . there is at least one measurement that 's native to this show the ruthless people counter at the bottom of the screen throughout the night . 204 , 512 watching now , it read during the moment when ms . stirling and pentatonix won their award . by the time eminem closed the show with a blistering performance of rap###god , the number , which shot up and down all night , was , 903 . he could have announced a ustream session on his twitter 15 minutes###earlier and attracted more people . from one angle , at least , the lack of structure was an asset . this was perhaps the only awards show in history to run short , ending before the advertised time even with several minutes of filler stuffed in like so much styrofoam before eminem 's closing performance . and so someone at the google mother###ship will likely be poring over charts and spreadsheets that assess dollars spent per viewer minutes of engagement . it clearly cost a lot of money to look this disheveled . but like any number of artists with a webcam , a dream and a bit of hubris , youtube was entitled to screw up in full view of everyone . and after this bizarre but comforting experiment , it 's earned the right to try again next year .
indianapolis the nets have had a playoff###spot secured for several weeks now , and their seeding third , fourth or fifth has been the only thing at stake since . they might have begun resting players , or relaxed a bit , or even conceded a game or two , and few would have questioned it . but their foot has stayed firmly on the pedal to the postseason , ignoring the yield signs like the ice bags piling up in the locker###room that might give another team some pause . they have stated a tangible goal home###court###advantage for the first round . they have stayed quieter about another proving to themselves that they are ready to make a playoff###run . at bankers###life###fieldhouse on friday , a sold out crowd provided a postseason type atmosphere and the bumps and bruises validated it . the nets seemed to go through the ebbs and flows of an entire series in one hard fought night and ended it optimistically with an impressive 117 109 win over indiana . this was what a playoff###game looks like , guard jerry###stackhouse said . after building a 24 point lead , the nets lost it in the third quarter and lost their composure over the referees and the pacers' physical###play . but they managed to steady themselves in the fourth , closing the game on an 18 8 run . with the win , and chicago 's loss to toronto , the nets clinched the fourth###seed in the eastern###conference , guaranteeing the home###court###advantage they were seeking , and giving them a new feeling of self assurance after a tough victory in a hostile###environment . hopefully , practices thursday and friday will be productive , coach p . j . carlesimo said . but they 're not going to be as productive as this was . deron###williams scored 33 points , including 18 in the second quarter , but sustained###injuries to his knee and neck that left him hobbling as the game ended . it was everything , williams said jokingly . i blacked###out , i think . the nets were already without gerald###wallace , who missed his second game with a left heel bruise , and they lost forward reggie###evans in the third quarter after he picked up a second technical###foul and was ejected from the game . without evans , the momentum abruptly reversed toward indiana . the nets led , 81 64 , when evans was tossed , but three minutes later , with 2 minutes 10 seconds###left in the period , their lead was down to . this came after the nets put together one of their most impressive halves of the season , scoring 69 points a season high for a half on 65 percent shooting to go into the locker###room ahead by . but the pacers picked up their defensive pressure , and the nets began to lose their cool . things began to slip away when keith###bogans and lance###stephenson needed to be separated after bogans fouled him hard while stephenson was going for a layup . then evans was ejected after tossing his headband in disgust over a foul call . indiana seized on the nets' loss of composure . george hill scored 11 points in the third quarter , and the pacers held the nets to just . 8 percent###shooting . with five minutes left in the game , a 3 pointer by stephenson gave indiana its first lead . the crowd was in a frenzy , and the nets appeared lost . a 24 point lead had been blown . the playoffs felt a long way away . we lost our composure there for a minute , joe###johnson said . it was johnson , who finished with 24 points his most since feb . 19 who hit a 3 pointer to tie the score again . the pacers would never regain the lead . stackhouse added another 3 pointer , and baskets by brook###lopez and andray###blatche provided the nets enough cushion to close out the win . afterward , groaning as he sat down in the locker###room , bags of ice at his feet , williams said what the nets needed to hear . i feel like i just played a playoff###game , williams said .
highlights from hillary###clinton 's speech hillary###rodham###clinton speaks about advancing the role of women around the world at the clinton###global###initiative . after a temporary tour as a lieutenant in president###obama 's army , hillary###rodham###clinton rejoined the clinton family business on thursday and went right to work on one of its main###objectives advancing the clinton brand . mrs . clinton appeared###alongside her husband , bill clinton , in a crowded ballroom here and left little doubt that she planned to reclaim the political stage she exited more than four years###ago to become the nation 's top diplomat . at the annual###gathering of the foundation established by her husband , mrs . clinton delivered a speech that plunged her back into the heart of the conversation about the country 's future , highlighting the need for creating###jobs for young people and expanding early###childhood###development programs . in too many places in our own country , community institutions are crumbling , she said , expressing###concern about disconnected young###men in our society . mrs . clinton also pledged to continue her work of expanding opportunities for women and girls as she moves into her new role at what has been renamed the bill , hillary and chelsea clinton###foundation . this is truly a labor of love for our entire###family , she said . the convention here in downtown chicago had been billed as the foundation 's effort to bring together leaders from the business , nonprofit and government sectors to discuss###ways to revive the nation 's economy . but there was little doubt about the main###attraction on thursday , as speculation in and out of the convention site focused on whether mrs . clinton 's appearance was a sign of her interest in running for president in . mrs . clinton finds herself adjusting to an unfamiliar reality she holds no government title now for the first time in more than two decades . and she and her aides seem to be grappling with how best to keep her in the news , without the state###department apparatus that provided an elevated stage for her during the past four years . while she has said she just wants to sleep and exercise and travel for fun after leaving the state###department , her appearance on thursday was clearly intended to ensure that she does not drift too far from public attention . her aides alerted journalists days before that her appearance would be a significant###event . the convention which is scheduled to run through friday showed the passions the clintons continue to generate . the ballroom was packed with hundreds of admirers , and the guest list included some big###names in finance , politics , government and entertainment jacob j . lew , the treasury###secretary gary cohn , the president of goldman###sachs randi###weingarten , the president of the american###federation###of###teachers gov . chris###christie of new jersey and eva###longoria , the actress and political activist . and yet mrs . clinton 's speech underscored the gap that still exists between the fervent enthusiasm of her admirers , who rose from their chairs and clapped madly when she walked onstage and her deliberate and cautious manner . at times during her speech , she came across as dryly academic , citing studies and statistics . the speech was notable , too , in what she did not dwell on there was barely any mention of mr . obama as mrs . clinton seemed to turn the page on that chapter , and bask once again in her husband 's embrace . the warm###reception from the crowd was a far cry from the public battering that mrs . clinton has received in recent###months . indeed , the popularity she has enjoyed in the polls during much of her term dropped in recent weeks , as republicans in washington have intensified an investigation into possible lapses at the state###department that may have left an american diplomatic station in benghazi , libya , vulnerable to a deadly attack last year . there has been other potentially###damaging news , including the recent disclosure of a report by a state###department investigator asserting that high###ranking officials under mrs . clinton tried to cover up allegations that american###diplomats and security agents solicited prostitutes . mrs . clinton , who has been working on a memoir , has undertaken a gradual effort to re engage politically and otherwise after years of remaining above the partisan fray and focusing on diplomacy . in march , she released a video announcing that she was reversing her earlier position and endorsing same###sex###marriage . and this week , she opened a twitter###account with a profile that described her as wife , mom , lawyer , women kids advocate , floar , flotus , us senator , secstate , author , dog owner , hair icon , pantsuit aficionado , glass###ceiling cracker , tbd ...
republican###lawmakers on sunday criticized president###obama 's vision for winding down the war on terrorism , using talk show appearances to accuse him of misunderstanding the threat in a way that will embolden unfriendly nations . we show this lack of resolve , talking about the war being over , senator lindsey###graham , republican of south###carolina , said on fox###news###sunday . what do you think the iranians are thinking ? at the end of the day , this is the most tone###deaf president i ever could imagine . in his first major foreign###policy address of his second term , mr . obama said last week that it was time for the united###states to narrow the scope of its long battle against terrorists and begin a transition away from a war###footing . in addition to renewing his call to close the detention facility at guant###namo###bay , cuba , he said he would seek to limit his own war powers . he also issued new policy###guidelines that would shift the responsibility for drone###strikes to the military from the central###intelligence###agency , and said there would be stricter standards for such attacks . mr . graham , a strong supporter of the drone program , said he objected to changing the standards . separately , he called for a special###counsel to investigate both the justice###department , which has come under scrutiny for seizing journalists' phone###records , and the internal###revenue###service , which has acknowledged that it unfairly targeted conservative groups seeking tax###exempt###status . democrats , including representative debbie###wasserman###schultz of florida and senator richard j . durbin of illinois , praised mr . obama for what they said was a necessary rebalancing of civil###liberties and national###security interests . we have to balance our values , ms . wasserman###schultz said sunday on the abc###news program this week . but at least two lawmakers the current and former chairmen of the house homeland###security###committee , representative michael###mccaul of texas and peter t . king of new york complained specifically about the president 's remarks about guant###namo###bay . mr . mccaul warned against closing the detention###center , especially if it meant moving prisoners to the united###states . name me one american city that would like to host these guys , he said on the cnn program state of the union . more than half the remaining 166 detainees at guant###namo###bay are yemeni of these , 56 have been cleared to go home . mr . obama has proposed repatriating detainees when he can , but will still face the thorny question of what to do several dozen men who cannot be prosecuted and who have been deemed to be too dangerous to release . mr . king , appearing with ms . wasserman###schultz on this week , said the detention facility had been a success . many experts believe it did work , he said , adding that he was very concerned about sending detainees back to yemen . noting that mr . obama had campaigned on a promise to close the prison , he said the president could have done a lot more than he has done if he was serious about it rather than just moralizing . in calling for a special###counsel , mr . graham said the justice###department had begun to criminalize journalism and had engaged in an overreach in investigating leaks of classified national###security information . he also complained of an organized###effort within the i.r.s . to target political###opponents of the president . i think it comes from the top , he said , although current and former i.r.s . officials have said mr . obama did not know of the targeting .
durham , n.c . the n.b.a . on friday imposed a two game suspension on nets coach jason###kidd , who pleaded###guilty in july to a drunken driving charge . the punishment was expected , and it matched the league 's penalties for similar###incidents . the suspension will delay the coaching###debut of kidd , who had a 19 year playing###career . the nets open the season oct . 30 on the road against the cleveland###cavaliers and host the miami###heat on nov . 1 . kidd will make his debut nov . 3 , when the nets visit the orlando###magic . we all knew that it was going to come at some point , kidd said . you have to be responsible . the league came down with the suspension , and i accept that . kidd , 40 , rammed his sport###utility###vehicle into a telephone pole in the hamptons around 2 a.m . on july , 2012 . the accident occurred just days after he signed to play for the knicks . kidd , who retired after last season , negotiated a plea deal this summer that included community###service around new york . there 's no distraction , kidd said . it 's just a part of business , being accountable and being able to move on . kidd said he had not yet decided who would be his replacement for the two games , but the assistant###coach lawrence###frank seemed the obvious###choice . frank has already established himself as perhaps the most vocal presence on the coaching###staff . billy king , the nets' general###manager , said in a statement , the decision is consistent with what the league has done in the past , and we look forward to jason leading our team versus orlando and the rest of the year . the nets will finish their six day training###camp on saturday . after friday 's practice , several players played down the effect of kidd 's suspension . we pretty much knew this was coming , point###guard deron###williams said . it 's pretty mandatory for the n.b.a . to issue a two game suspension for this type of incident . williams said the nets would be comfortable with frank as coach .
gainesville , fla . pat young scored 15 points , becoming the 50th player###in###school###history to reach , 000 in his career , and no . 13 florida handled savannah###state 76 34 on sunday . young received a standing###ovation as he left the game with 41 remaining , waving to the crowd as his achievement was announced . young topped the , 000 point plateau on a putback with 15 to play . it came shortly after he stepped to the free###throw line with a chance to join the club . young clanged it off the front rim , drawing groans from the crowd . he made amends , though , a few minutes later . young was one of four florida players in double###figures . michael frazier ii had 11 points for the gators . casey prather and scottie wilbekin chipped in 10 points each . jyles smith led savannah###state ( 2 11 ) with eight points and eight rebounds . the tigers have lost nine straight . it was florida 's 22nd consecutive###home win , leaving coach billy###donovan 's team two shy of the school record set in . the gators dominated from the opening tip , getting any shot they wanted against the undersized tigers . florida used two double###digit runs to make the game a rout , outscoring savannah###state 12 0 early and then 14 0 a few minutes later . the tigers went 47 without a basket before enduring an 12 scoreless stretch . florida led 34 11 at halftime and coasted from there . it had to be a somewhat different feeling for the gators , who had eight days off after a brutal stretch that included games against florida###state , then no . 12 connecticut , then no . 13 kansas , then no . 15 memphis and fresno state . it marked the first time in donovan 's 18 seasons in gainesville that florida played consecutive non conference###teams ranked in the top . the only thing worth###watching in the second half was young 's countdown to , 000 . he had eight points in the first half and needed only four more to reach the milestone . young got a layup on florida 's second possession after the break and then went nearly 10 minutes without another shot . as he stepped to the free###throw line , the crowd knew what was at stake . he smiled after making the first one , which put him at 999 points , but grimaced as the second free###throw came up short . no worries , though . he crashed the boards for his sixth rebound a short time later and topped , 000 points with a tip in . donovan took him out at the next timeout .
( reuters ) vasco###da###gama and corinthians have both been ordered to play their next four home###matches without their own supporters following crowd###trouble at their brazilian###championship match last month . brazil 's sporting tribunal said that both teams must play their next two home###games behind closed###doors . for the subsequent two home###games , they will only be allowed to sell###tickets to supporters of the visiting###team . trouble broke out at the match on aug 25 when corinthians supporters invaded an area reserved for vasco fans and then fought with riot###police at brasilia 's mane garrincha stadium . vasco , who are based in rio de janeiro and were officially the home###team , had decided to stage the game in brasilia under an agreement with sponsors and were punished for failing to ensure that adequate security was provided . the corinthians supporters' group known as the gavioes da fiel ( hawks of the faithful ) blamed the incidents on a small minority of supporters and said it had suspended three of its members .
st . louis if it seems as if don###mattingly is writing out a new batting order for the los###angeles###dodgers every night , it 's because he just about is . with the season approaching the halfway###point , mattingly used a major###league high 74 batting orders in the first 78 games for his injury stricken team . seattle ( 72 ) and miami ( 71 ) were just behind entering friday , while baltimore ( 39 ) and st . louis ( 40 ) were the standards of stability , according to stats l.l.c . i do n't know if there 's a manager alive that would n't want to come to the park and have one through nine set for you , marlins manager mike###redmond said . a manager is always trying to figure out that spot where guys have the most success and it benefits the team . i think that 's the beauty of managing , trying to figure that out . injuries , statistics , slumps and matchups all play a role in trying to find that perfect order . and then there was billy###martin , who said he occasionally pulled names out of a hat to determine his batting order when his teams were struggling . you like having things set , white###sox manager robin###ventura said . that would be nice , but it 's not always that easy having teams where you 're just going to sit there and have the same nine guys play , the same guys hitting . only two white###sox players have been fixtures at their slots this season the leadoff###hitter alejandro de aza and the no . 3 hitter alex rios . texas manager ron###washington used 55 batting orders , with five players sharing the no . 3 hole and six batting no . 5 . during his career , washington appreciated relative certainty . in , his most productive###season as a player , all but 20 of his starts came batting first or second . as soon as we get back to the way i know we can go , you can see that same lineup , washington said . it ai n't going to be jumping back and forth . i think these guys love when they come to the yard knowing exactly where they are every day . washington judged that elvis###andrus failed in the leadoff spot because he stopped being aggressive , that he took too many strikes early in the count . ian###kinsler took over at the top of the order in mid###june , and he said familiarity brought comfort . washington said you definitely understand the players around you and the players that are hitting in front of you and behind you and what they like to do and their tendencies . the more you play with the guys around you , the better feeling you have . mattingly has had to work around injuries to matt###kemp , hanley ramirez and carl###crawford , in addition to andre###ethier 's season long slide . eight players have batted cleanup , and a dozen have hit fifth . cardinals manager mike###matheny took over last season from tony###la###russa , a manager he played under . in leading the cardinals to the 2011 world###series title , la russa used 126 lineups during the regular###season . and that was down from 147 the previous###season . matheny changes up the batting order to keep players fresh during the grind of 162 games in 182 days . if you 've got a healthy group of guys that are feeling good and do n't look like they need days , i love throwing them out there , he said . that 's the way the game is supposed to be played . oakland 's bob###melvin , the reigning american###league manager of the year , relies###heavily on matchups . chris###young has hit in every spot but cleanup , jed###lowrie in all but the no . 8 hole and seth###smith everywhere but leadoff , according to stats l.l.c . based on some of the resources we have , this is the way we have to do it , melvin said . i 'm all for it . it keeps everybody involved . redmond notes conditions change after the first time through the order , and is n't averse to a little experimentation . i always thought if you take a guy who 's used to hitting fourth or fifth and lead him off , sometimes it energizes guys and this could be kind of fun , he said . cincinnati 's dusty###baker , a three time national###league manager of the year , complains that his team has been behind the eight###ball since ryan###ludwick tore cartilage in his right shoulder while sliding on opening day . well , you 've got to do what you 've got to do , baker said . sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't . still , no alibis , no excuses when it does n't . twins manager ron###gardenhire maintains that creativity is an absolute must . he recalled an era when filling out the lineup card was as easy as pushing the print button . i do n't###mind moving people around and trying different things and reading all these stats that you guys love so awful dearly much , which are fun it 's fun###stuff to read , gardenhire said . it 's kind of fun at times to try different things and see how it goes , but it 's so much easier when you can at least set six or seven guys in one spot and kind of play with the other guys and make sure everybody gets at bats . and going into a game , a manager never knows which slot will come up in the moment . i 've always thought that 's a topic that 's pretty selfish , where you hit in the lineup , matheny said . i address this with youth coaches and parents a lot , too . it should n't be a conversation because that seventh###spot could be the most important spot in the lineup that night .
chapel###hill , n.c . andrew parker hit a three run homer in the sixth while starter mike volpe allowed one unearned###run in seven innings to help towson beat florida###atlantic 7 2 on friday , the tigers' first ncaa###tournament appearance in 22 years , in the chapel###hill regional . parker 's blast capped a five run inning for the third seeded tigers , who had n't played in the regionals since . volpe ( 10 3 ) allowed four hits and threw 120 pitches before leaving with a 7 0 lead after walking the leadoff batter in the eighth . peter###bowles and dominic fratantuono also drove in runs in the sixth for towson , while brendan butler added a solo homer in the eighth . the win for towson added to what is arguably the best feel good story in the tournament . the program was supposed to be cut because of financial###problems in the athletic###department and gender###equity imbalance , but the team was saved last month when the state of maryland approved , 000 to fund the team for two years . i 'm thrilled our kids have a future , coach mike gottlieb said . i 'm thrilled i 'm not looking for a job . i 'm thrilled after 22 years personally , we 're able to be back here in this environment . it was a long time without getting here . just to be able to do that again after such a drought and at my age , that 's very rewarding . despite the possibility that the team faced an uncertain future , gottlieb said his players continued to play hard through it all . maybe they discussed the future or a lack of one , i never heard of it , he said . i never heard it . and they never played like they did n't care . they played hard . to their credit , we 're here and we were able to get a victory today . jeremy strawn ( 5 3 ) allowed seven hits and five runs in five innings for the second seeded owls , who had won 11 straight including a run to the sun###belt###conference tournament title . tyler rocklein and brendon sanger drove in the owls' two eighth###inning runs after volpe 's exit .
( reuters ) shanshan###feng won###accolades when she returned###home after becoming china 's first winner on the lpga###tour , and now she returns to locust hill to defend her lpga###championship , the second major of the season . the 23 year old feng , coming off a runner up finish in last week 's shoprite###lpga###classic in new jersey , will be trying to extend a streak of eight consecutive lpga majors won by asian players in the tournament beginning on thursday . her lpga###championship triumph in pittsford , new york , thrust feng into the spotlight . she held a news conference at the airport upon her return to china , another one in beijing and another in her hometown of guangzhou and topping her list of coolest things about being a major champion came at a special awards###ceremony in january . i was named best non olympic athlete in china , feng told###reporters ahead of thursday 's opening round . i was sitting with so many of the olympic players in china and i was the first golfer to be nominated . i think the government is paying more attention to golf . feng had seven other top 10 finishes in . this year , she has posted four top 10s from eight events and feels a switch to different clubs helped her to the runner up finish last weekend and boosted her confidence . my iron shots were really accurate and my short game was pretty good . so i would say the clubs helped a lot , the world number seven said . competition in the 144 player field will be keen , including a trio of south###korean winners of the last three major titles . world number one inbee###park , winner of this season 's opening grand###slam , the kraft###nabisco###championship , reigning u.s . women 's open###champion choi na###yeon , and british women 's open winner jiyai###shin are eager to add more hardware on the testing locust hill layout . i do n't know whether i 'm getting old , ( but ) the course is tougher , said 24 year old park . it 's a very tough golf course , very good , challenging . the rough is really up and the greens are really firmer than the years i 've###played before . american stacy###lewis , winner of the 2011 kraft nabisco and the last non asian to win a major , is confident she can return to the winner 's circle . i feel like i 've had chances , and i 've been in contention , so it does n't weigh on me that much , said world number two lewis , who has won six times on tour since winning the kraft . i feel like my game is made for majors and it 's only a matter of time . australian karrie###webb , who held off feng to win last week 's lpga event , showed she was still a threat to add to her major championships haul of seven . i guess i do n't look at the age thing , said webb . i know what i 'm capable of and i know that 's good enough to win out here . feng showed she could win by charging back from three shots out to win in her last visit locust hill , firing a final round 67 for a two stroke victory . despite the newfound attention , feng said she has a way to go to match the popularity of yani###tseng and ai miyazato in their home###countries . yani 's like a rock star in taiwan . it 's like ai miyazato in japan , said feng . me , in china , well , i still can have a hamburger in my hand and a coke in my hand and eat on the street and nobody would recognize me . but of course , after we play better and better , of course more and more people will recognize us .
as the defense continued on monday to roll out witnesses in the george###zimmerman trial , now entering its third week , that question continued to be pivotal . the answer , however , may remain elusive , because the screams were distant and the audio , from a 911 call , was too limited to allow for a scientific###opinion in court . the prosecution and the defense have wrangled repeatedly over the issue , which could help determine who the aggressor was in the confrontation that led to the death of trayvon###martin , the unarmed teenager whom mr . zimmerman shot and killed on feb . 26 , 2012 . mr . zimmerman , 29 , who is charged with second degree murder , is claiming self###defense . but defense lawyers tried to bolster arguments that the man crying help was mr . zimmerman , and not mr . martin . their key###witness tracy martin , mr . martin 's father . two days after the shooting , mr . martin went to the sanford police for an update on the investigation . he listened to the 911 call , where cries for help could be heard in the background . asked by an officer whether he heard his son 's voice , a distraught mr . martin responded , no , officer chris serino , the investigator , told the jury . a second officer within earshot of mr . martin that day also testified that mr . martin responded no to the question . i heard it and saw the movement of his mouth , said officer serino , who was the lead###investigator in the case . but about two weeks later , mr . martin changed his mind , the defense said . the martin family lawyer , benjamin crump , told###reporters at the time that mr . martin had listened to a cleaned up version of the audio and recognized his son 's voice . in a heart###wrenching turn on the stand monday , mr . martin was asked to explain the discrepancy between his initial###reaction and the one that followed . he told the jury that the police were wrong . i never said that was n't my son 's voice , mr . martin said . mr . martin said he could not tell whether it was his son 's voice the first time he heard the tape , on feb . 28 , a tumultuous , distressing day for him . as mr . martin listened to the recording at the station that day , he had no idea he would hear the gunshot that killed his son , he said . it 's very difficult to believe that trayvon is not living , mr . martin said , describing his devastation . as i said over and over , that was my best friend in life . to have him gone is a tragedy . on march , the martin family was invited to the sanford mayor 's office to hear the neighbors' 911 calls , including the one with the shout for help . after the family left the office , he said he stayed behind to listen to the tape repeatedly , alone . at that point , he concluded it was his son , mr . martin said . after listening to the tape , for maybe 20 times , i said that i knew it was trayvon 's voice , he said . other friends and relatives of trayvon###martin , including his mother , sybrina fulton , also have testified that it was the 17 year old mr . martin screaming . tracy martin 's turn on the witness stand proved tricky for the defense because of the poignancy of his testimony . i was choked up myself , doris singleton , a sanford police###officer , testified , describing her reaction that day at the station . she said she overheard mr . martin 's conversation with officer serino . i felt horrible for him . in a new twist , the judge , debra s . nelson of seminole###county court , ruled monday that she would allow the jury to hear about mr . martin 's toxicology report , which showed small###amounts of marijuana in his system . last week , in proceedings without the jury present , a medical###examiner who performed the autopsy on mr . martin testified that the marijuana could have affected the teenager 's behavior the night he encountered mr . zimmerman . earlier on monday , the defense called other witnesses to try to persuade the jury that it was mr . zimmerman crying for help . there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that is george###zimmerman , john###donnelly , a friend of mr . zimmerman 's who served as a combat###medic in vietnam and is now a physician###assistant , testified . mr . donnelly 's wife , leanne benjamin , also testified that it was mr . zimmerman shouting on the recording . mr . donnelly , who described mr . zimmerman as a very dear###friend , said he and his wife had donated , 000 to efforts on his behalf and had spent , 700 on a court wardrobe for him . mr . zimmerman , the neighborhood###watch coordinator for the housing###complex where the shooting occurred , claimed that he shot mr . martin in self###defense after mr . martin punched him and repeatedly slammed his head into the pavement . mr . martin was on the way to his father 's girlfriend 's house , where he was staying as a guest . prosecutors maintain that mr . zimmerman purposefully followed mr . martin and instigated the confrontation . the cries for help on the 911 call are distinct . but an f.b.i . audio expert has said the quality of the recording and the short###duration of the screams , among other things , made it too difficult to isolate who it was . he suggested that a person familiar with either mr . zimmerman 's or mr . martin 's voice under similar###circumstances might be able to identify the person screaming in the call . during cross###examination , the prosecution used the witnesses' testimony about the screams to repeatedly play another recording the one of mr . zimmerman referring to the person he found suspicious as punks and saying they always get away , while talking to a police dispatcher . he used expletives in both remarks . bernie de la rionda , the chief###prosecutor in the case , suggested to witnesses that mr . zimmerman was angry or agitated . mr . zimmerman 's friends disputed that characterization . mark o'mara , one of mr . zimmerman 's lawyers , flipped the argument to ask the witnesses whether mr . zimmerman sounded full of hatred , ill will or spite . the answer was no . those three words are important because a second degree murder###conviction requires the demonstration of a depraved mind , one that harbored hatred , ill will or spite . other testimony noted that mr . zimmerman could shoot a weapon with both his left and right hands . while he writes with his left###hand , he does most everything else with his right hand .
washington senate democratic leaders reached agreement thursday on a 110 billion mix of tax increases and spending###cuts to head off automatic spending###cuts through the end of the year . but with even some democrats tepid on the proposal , the chances of a deal before the march 1 deadline have receded . the democratic proposal would establish a 30 percent minimum tax###rate on incomes over 1 million to raise about 54 billion over 10 years . it would raise 1 billion more by subjecting tar###sands oil to a tax to pay for oil###spill cleanups and by ending a business tax###deduction for the cost of moving###equipment overseas . the remaining 55 billion would come from . 5 billion in defense cuts from 2015 to 2021 and . 5 billion in farm subsidy cuts . the legislation is more a bargaining###position than a solution . republicans have said they will not accept any new taxes in a deal to head off the so called sequester across the board cuts to defense and domestic programs of 5 percent to 8 percent and totaling about 1 trillion over 10 years . but senate democratic leaders said thursday that their party must rally support around an alternative to try to move negotiations forward . this bill is an important chess###piece , said senator charles e . schumer of new york , the no . 3 democrat in the senate . speaker john a . boehner of ohio on thursday repeated his demand that the senate take the first steps to replace the spending###cuts before the house considers its move , but no one predicted that the senate democrats' proposal would rally the bipartisan###support needed to overcome a near certain republican filibuster and reach the house . i would hope that we can get to 51 votes , and that majority would rule , said senator barbara###mikulski , democrat of maryland , the chairwoman of the senate###appropriations###committee . i 'm confident we will have the majority if not the totality of the democratic caucus . senate democrats emerged from a protracted lunch meeting over the plan voicing only grudging support . senator max###baucus of montana , the chairman of the tax writing finance committee , said he worried that wringing savings from farm subsidies now instead of in a broad farm bill would make it harder to pass an overhaul of agricultural programs that has been stalled for nearly a year . senators tom###harkin , democrat of iowa , and bernie###sanders , independent of vermont , denounced the 50 50 mix of cuts and taxes , after democrats have swallowed far more spending###cuts than tax increases over two years of deficit###reduction efforts . this is not a solution even they know it ca n't pass that 's the idea , said senator mitch###mcconnell of kentucky , the republican leader . it 's a political stunt . the white###house praised the package . jay###carney , the press###secretary , called it a balanced plan to avoid across the board budget###cuts that will hurt kids , seniors , and our men and women in uniform . republicans in congress face a simple choice , he added . do they protect investments in education , health###care and national###defense , or do they continue to prioritize and protect tax###loopholes that benefit the very few at the expense of middle and working###class americans ? as the cuts approach , warnings of disaster are growing###increasingly dire . the senate###appropriations###committee released a barrage of letters from agencies spelling out how the cuts would be meted out 600 , 000 low income women and children dropped from federal nutrition programs meat and poultry plants forced to close because of furloughed federal inspectors deep###cuts to the poor school systems that rely most heavily on federal###assistance delayed permits for oil and gas production and shorter seasons , reduced operating###hours and possible park closings in the national###park system . job###losses could reach , 000 this year , said representative chris###van###hollen , democrat of maryland . while republicans and democrats agree the cuts would be destructive , neither side seems ready to negotiate a solution . senator harry###reid of nevada , the majority###leader , reached out to mr . boehner on thursday . mr . boehner said he told mr . reid what he has been saying publicly the house will look at what the senate can produce . this sequester was the president 's idea , mr . boehner said . his party needs to follow through on their plans to replace it .
q . do plants feel pain ? when a tree is pruned , for example , does it suffer ? a . the answer depends on what one considers the phrase 'feel pain' to mean , said dr . amy litt , director of the plant genomic program at the new york botanical###garden in the bronx . animal pain depends on having brains , nerves and so forth . plants do n't have these , she said . therefore we can say they do n't###feel pain . but plants do respond to being damaged or attacked , dr . litt added . if you define feeling pain as showing a response to a part of you being chopped off , then you could say they do feel pain . when a plant is wounded , perhaps by a gnawing insect , the short###term response is the release of an airborne chemical signal that is detected by the rest of the plant as well as by neighboring###plants . the signal essentially warns of danger and the need to activate cellular defense###mechanisms , dr . litt said . over the long###term , a plant that has been pruned may compensate and adapt by producing new shoots or buds . moving from plants to lower animals , dr . litt suggested that you could also ask whether things like jellyfish feel pain . jellyfish have an extremely###simple nervous system and no brain . yet they respond to stimuli that might be interpreted by animals as painful , she noted , often by pulling back in the way a human being would . so you can interpret that as feeling pain , she said . or are they only aware of being poked ?
washington if there were a chutzpah caucus in the united###states###senate , kirsten###gillibrand of new york would be its natural leader . on a fund raising swing through chicago this fall , she told donors to pressure their hometown senator richard j . durbin , a democrat who is one of the most powerful###men in the senate because he had yet to sign on to her bill to address sexual###assault in the military . mr . durbin fumed when he heard about the move , an unusual breach in the protocol conscious senate . she defies her party in smaller ways after a bipartisan farm bill was cobbled together with great###effort by her colleague debbie###stabenow of michigan , ms . gillibrand tried to block cuts to food###stamps that other democrats said were needed to retain republican support and brought in high###profile foodies from new york , including the celebrity###chef tom###colicchio , to fight it . her other tactics include cornering colleagues on the senate floor and refusing to stop###talking , and popping out a news release picking apart a senator 's competing legislation as it is being announced . if her colleagues grumble about her ambition in a body where freshman members are applauded for keeping their heads down , so be it . i 'm trying to fight for men and women who should n't be raped in the military , she said of her work on the sexual###assault legislation . if her approach makes a colleague uncomfortable , she said , that 's a price worth###paying . but ms . gillibrand 's savvy has quickly###brought her national###prominence in a chamber in which she has served less than five years and has elevated the issues she has championed , like the sexual###assault bill and gays in the military . her relentlessness is combined with a personal warmth and charm she steps an inch toward anyone who approaches her , not away , locking eyes as they speak and she deftly uses outside advocacy###groups and the news###media to push her agenda . she just approaches colleagues differently than other republicans and democrats from new york , said senator charles e . grassley , republican of iowa . what distinguishes her , he said , is her determination and knowledge and willingness to sit down one on one with senators and explain what she is up to . an outside player in her caucus , the new york democrat is nonetheless admired for her ample fund raising , especially by women she has raised nearly 30 million since being appointed in , a tally that has scared away potential challengers from both parties and turned her into a mentor for female###candidates around the country . ms . gillibrand , who is , was the youngest senator when she was sworn in , and she seems a distinctly modern figure in a sometimes cobwebbed institution . she can swear like the litigator she once was , and runs one of the most informal offices in the senate her staff members are welcome in jeans and even in something resembling pajamas , and they call her kirsten , rather than senator , largely unheard of on capitol###hill . she appeared in an elegant dress in vogue###magazine , and is co captain of the congressional softball team . seemingly always working she has a book out next september ms . gillibrand nonetheless leaves the office promptly at 5 every night to pick up her children from school . if there is a vote at that hour , she has developed a system to signal her aye or nay from a doorway off the senate floor where children are not permitted so she can hold onto her 5 year old 's hand . she is ubiquitous , said senator susan###collins , republican of maine , and i mean that as a compliment . i do n't know how she does it . some of ms . gillibrand 's democratic colleagues are less enamored , likening her zeal to that of the tea###party republicans who hew to a belief and wo n't let it go , ignoring some of the structural protocols of seniority . she is unwilling to knuckle under to demands for deference , said eugene r . fidell , who teaches military justice at yale###law###school . it is very rare that you see a relatively junior member of the senate staking out a position and sticking by it . ms . gillibrand 's taste for a fight was presaged in her decision to run for the house in , when she took on representative###john e . sweeney in a republican rich district in upstate new york . when she approached howard wolfson , a democratic strategist , for help , he told her she could not win . she told me she was going to run , was going to win , and i would either be the winning consultant or someone else would be , he said . i took the race .
stoked by rising inventories , the american economy grew at a significantly###faster pace in the third quarter than first estimated , but probably at the expense of economic###activity during the current quarter as businesses work off some of the excess stock on their shelves and in warehouses . as investors digested the better than expected data on thursday from the commerce###department for july , august and september , many economists immediately cut their estimates for fourth###quarter growth . barclays , for example , now expects the nation 's gross###domestic###product to advance at only a.5 percent annual###rate , down from 2 percent and far below the government 's latest estimate of a.6 percent pace for the third quarter . a final###revision is scheduled dec . 20 . still , the latest###data comes at a time when other signs are pointing to improved economic###performance next year , both in the united###states and abroad , including more robust manufacturing activity and hiring . in london on thursday , british officials raised their projections for growth in 2013 and , a sharp reversal from a year ago , when britain was flirting with a double dip recession . on the continent , however , the outlook is bleaker . on thursday , the european###central###bank raised its estimate for growth next year by just . 1 percentage###point to a still anemic . 1 percent the central###bank expects the euro###zone the 17 european###nations that use the euro to show a contraction of . 4 percentage###point once all the data for 2013 is in . all in all , we 're seeing positive developments , mario draghi , the president of the central###bank , said at a news conference , after the bank left its main interest rate unchanged at . 25 percent . the situation in europe makes the united###states look good by comparison , even if things are not as rosy as the latest###figures from washington might suggest . you can never be unhappy with a.6 percent number for gross###domestic###product , said ian shepherdson , chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics . but the details are more sobering than the headlines . apart from the inventory numbers , the revisions are pretty trivial . either companies thought demand would accelerate and built inventories in anticipation of sales that did n't###happen , mr . shepherdson added , or they 're building in anticipation of stronger demand in the fourth###quarter . with demand uncertain in the final three months of the year , mr . shepherdson expects fourth###quarter growth will probably run at a pace of 1 to 2 percent . the economy 's performance in the final months of 2013 will also determine the denouement of one of the longest###running dramas on wall###street the timing of when the federal###reserve begins easing its stimulus efforts . investors and traders had expected policy###makers to begin tapering its monthly 85 billion bond purchases in september , but the central###bank held off because of mixed economic###data . although the latest###data on growth in gross###domestic###product comes after a series of better than expected figures in the united###states , american central###bankers do n't appear to be in a rush to pull back on the stimulus . while they could act as soon as the next fed meeting later this month , many analysts do not expect a move until early . on thursday , the president of one regional fed bank indicated that he remained cautious . the strong third quarter does n't make a trend , said dennis p . lockhart , president of the atlanta fed . i am not prepared to interpret the revised third quarter number as an indication that the economy is on a much stronger track i think we 're still on that relatively moderate growth track . the spotlight on the fed will grow more intense after friday , when the labor department reports the latest###figures for job###creation and the unemployment###rate in november . although many economists say that the job###market will remain cloudy because of the aftereffect of october 's government###shutdown , the report will be closely###watched because it will provide the last major clue to the economy before fed policy###makers gather on dec . 17 and . it 's a big number , said diane swonk , chief economist at mesirow financial . i think they wo n't taper in december , but it is close . with a gain of , 000 positions , the jobs data for october was surprisingly robust , catching most economists off guard . on friday , the consensus calls for payrolls to have increased by , 000 last month with the unemployment###rate falling to . 2 percent , according to bloomberg###news . on thursday , the labor department said initial weekly jobless claims unexpectedly dropped to , 000 , the lowest in more than two months . experts warn the numbers could be volatile , especially the unemployment###rate , which is based on a survey separate from the one that tracks hiring and was affected heavily by furloughed government workers in october . the subsequent return of those workers could push the unemployment###rate back down more sharply for november , economists said . if it drops to . 1 percent , it would reach the lowest###level in five years . the unemployment###rate is a complete guess , said ellen zentner , senior united###states economist at morgan###stanley . even if the more reliable payroll number is stronger than predicted , she said there was little chance of a fed move this month because fourth###quarter growth looks so weak . morgan###stanley expects the united###states economy to expand by just 1 percent in the final three months of the year .
not the head coaching fraternity , with only 32 jobs in the n.f.l. , it is one of the most exclusive groups in sports . instead , try getting a slot on a coaching###staff . by opening###kickoff in september , there will be more than 600 coordinators and assistants , as well as assistants to the coordinators and to the assistants , judging by current rosters . including the head###coach , jacksonville and tampa###bay are at one end of the spectrum with 23 positions , with pittsburgh and new england are at the other end . the steelers have 15 positions over all , and , perhaps not surprisingly , considering bill belichick 's involvement in nearly everything , the patriots have . you look at the game and the way the game has evolved , it has become specialized , said andy###reid , who moved to the chiefs after a 14 season run in philadelphia , which , like kansas###city , has 22 assistants . you break it down and you have red###zone , short###yardage , nickel , and then you have all these different personnel groups , and so you try to hire teachers to teach all these things you want to do . with no salary###cap for coaching###staffs , reid can do just that . he has the former vikings head###coach brad###childress as a spread game analyst . reid 's successor in philadelphia , chip###kelly , moved up from coaching the oregon###ducks . his staff includes a sports###science coordinator . you really have one , possibly two coaches at a position , reid said . special teams is big , so you have two coaches there . secondary , you have two coaches there one coach works with the cornerbacks , one coach works with the safeties . they 're offering the same voice but doing two different positions . offensive###line you break into halves , guard center and tackles , however it works . you 're o.k . there . and on down the line . each team has control of the number of assistants on staff , unlike , say , baseball , where m.l.b . rules allow for a manager and seven coaches to be dressed for games . the n.b.a . permits the head###coach and three assistants on the bench essentially a front row of chairs and more in a second row . the n.h.l . has no limits . in major college###football , n.c.a.a . rules allow nine assistants who can give on field instruction and recruit . there is no limit on the number of noncoaching staff members football programs can have , but when it comes to on field activity , they can only chart statistics . one reason for the expansion of n.f.l . staffs has been the willingness of teams to get recently###retired players involved . they might not have teaching###skills yet , but they understand the ins and outs of playing a specific position . so they step in as , say , an assistant###offensive###line###coach , todd washington in baltimore , or an aide to the tight###ends coach , justin peelle in philadelphia . another job is keeping up with the technology available for game preparation , scouting and strategy . you have a lot of behind the scenes guys who do more in the breakdown and the analyzing of data and so forth , so that 's an area of expansion , the so called quality###control positions , bengals coach marvin###lewis said . they 've expanded throughout the league . and there 's shaun huls with the eagles , given the title of sports###science coordinator . a mr . wizard of the gridiron ? there are a lot of other sports that have evolved faster than football has evolved from a science standpoint , kelly said , and we want to be on the cutting###edge of that . so huls will assist the strength###and###conditioning###coach , josh hingst , in the weight###room implementing individual plans for eagles players . he will also be trying to stay on the cutting###edge of what the new technology is out there not only to monitor our players working out , but recovery , kelly said . denver has four weight coaches , which makes its staff look even larger . but i believe in that because it 's more personalized , coach###john###fox said .
port st . lucie , fla . think of the stories jay horwitz could tell if he ever decided to write a memoir . horwitz , 67 , has been the mets' public###relations man since . for more than three decades , he has been a loyal protector for generations of mets players and staff , a cooperative object of their playful ridicule , and a witness to their behind the scenes madness , good and bad . horwitz may never release a tell all , but just over a month ago he produced the next best thing jay horwtizpr , a twitter###account that is emerging as a pure distillation of his character . he 's been around so long and seen so many different players , coaches , managers , and he 's got so much information , said justin###turner , who posts from redturn . he would n't be able to fit all his stories into one book . instead , he has been trying to squeeze them into 140 character messages sent daily to thousands of followers . horwitz began###posting in january at the urging of jeff wilpon , the team 's chief###operating###officer . wilpon gave him no strict###instructions , other than to be himself . and horwitz was offered a deal if he could accrue , 000 followers before midnight the first day , wilpon would donate , 000 to charity . horwitz , getting help from the mets' players online , reached the number , and wilpon wrote a check to hope shines for shannon , which benefits shannon forde , a mets public###relations staffer who is battling breast###cancer . i 'm old school , but jeff has been on me for a long time now to get with the program , horwitz said . i was n't quite resisting , but i 'm not really mechanical . i did n't think i could do it . i 'm not adept at this type of stuff . he added , but when your boss says something to you enough times , you do it . despite his early hesitation , horwitz has taken wilpon 's directive and run with it . the quintessential horwitz post takes a behind the scenes mets story from long###ago , wraps it inside a tone of self###deprecation , and blemishes it with at least one glaring typo . consider this item , from feb . 28 met davey###johnson for first time in 1981 when he was managing our team in jackson , ms . took him to diviner . lost wallet . he paid . not good . minutes later , horwitz posted that would be dinner . sorry just got done riding bike for an hour . at its best , the account has become a self referential stream of consciousness , a mixture of untold###stories and recurring jokes about early###morning bicycle workouts to counter calorific dinners , about the large###size of his head , about that time he drove his car into a ditch . among his early dispatches was a multipost account of the time john###franco and bret###saberhagen tied him up , covered him with bread###crumbs and left him outside on the pitchers' mound . a dozen sea gulls feasted upon him . franco used to torment me , horwitz said friday , sounding proud . john###franco 's one of my closest###friends in the business . other times , the account descends into literal nonsense . he has posted gibberish like tfgc , i , r , oii and cdxxxxxx . once , he directed a blank message to his own handle . the unintelligible posts are an extension of his history of annoying friends and colleagues with phone calls dialed inadvertently from his pockets . as he posted feb . 21 , here are my top five butt calls this week tim###teufel , ramon ramirez , livan hernandez , ike###davis and jack curry . will keep up . nice list . after starting his career composing notes using a typewriter and correction###fluid , horwitz admits he has not entirely kept up in the digital age . he often asks players for advice on the medium . among other things , they have reminded him that on twitter , people do not necessarily get when you are joking . pitcher collin mchugh , who posts from collin mchugh , found horwitz 's efforts to modernize both commendable and comical . he 's on his blackberry , typing with one finger , mchugh said , pulling his palm up close to his face to demonstrate , and you know it must take him like 45 minutes to compose a tweet . mchugh was asked if he could offer horwitz any advice . proofread it , he said , laughing . just read it over . and if it does n't sound right , delete it . but the typos , missteps and mild mockery feel like part of horwitz 's nature . i 've never been afraid to poke###fun at myself , and in my business , you ca n't be , he said . for people who know me , that 's just me . and through this foray online , more and more people are getting to know him , digital mustard stains and all . jon###niese threw three scoreless###innings in the mets' 6 2 victory over the detroit###tigers . david###wright had a run###scoring single in his final###game before leaving camp to join the united###states team for the world###baseball###classic .
florham###park , n.j . the wall outside the jets ' locker###room at their headquarters here is lined with the team 's historical numerical roster , and that was where calvin pace was pointing , discussing his football mortality , on a recent afternoon . you see those names over there , pace said . like , i remember him and him . they 're here , and now they 're gone . the first time quinton coples called him old man calvin , in training###camp , pace just laughed . so what if he was once teammates with emmitt###smith , or if his first career###sack came against jeff###garcia ? he was not old , just 33 as of last monday . but it did get pace thinking . he recalled when he was 23 like coples , wondering whether he would last as long in the n.f.l . as some of his arizona teammates and if so , how . he recognized how many names on that wall he had outlasted since signing with the jets before the 2008 season . jerricho###cotchery , dustin###keller , darrelle###revis , bart###scott , all gone . he realized that he was the senior member of a defense in transition . it all goes by so fast , pace said . pace , in his 11th season , has tried to delay the inevitable , and so he continues to adjust . he adapts to diminished playing time at outside linebacker while remaining a stabilizing###force , a player###coach rex###ryan likened to glue . pace sublimates his ego for the good of the defense , forgoing pass rushing opportunities to drop into coverage or stop the run , and he accepted reduced wages to re sign two months after being released , as a salary###cap casualty in february . he is also the jets' unvarnished conscience , an unofficial spokesman who delivers state of the team critiques after games , even though he would much prefer to pull his hoodie tight over his head and slink out of the locker###room . all of his experiences playing in new york the brett###favre brouhaha and the rise and fall of mark###sanchez , the two a.f.c . championship losses and the two lean seasons that followed have shaped his perspective as well as sharpened it . he has a keen ability to synthesize 60 frenzied minutes and place the outcome within the proper###context of both the day and the season , saying what teammates might be thinking but would never say publicly . rather than express frustration after last sunday 's 49 9 defeat in cincinnati as he did after a###4 point victory against buffalo in 2011 pace dismissed it as an isolated###incident , absorbed once but not again . before games is when pace unleashes all of the words his teammates never hear him speak during the week . his message , lasting a minute or two , is delivered to the defense just after they pray part football , part faith and all fury . man , he most definitely gives us the word , defensive###lineman sheldon richardson said . on oct . 7 in atlanta , pace challenged the linemen , telling them everybody 's got a game plan until they get punched in the mouth . you always want to be the first person to throw that punch . that night , the jets had two sacks and hurried falcons quarterback matt###ryan 14 times , boosting them to a 30 28 victory . before the game in cincinnati , pace spoke of the importance of thwarting the bengals' passing###offense , which , he noted with a chuckle , did not work so well . that pace did not register a sack last sunday was an anomaly . he had recorded one in five of his previous seven games , despite often being asked to perform less glamorous duties in a system that maximizes his versatility and athleticism . at 6 feet 4 inches and 265 pounds , pace is imposing enough to foil the run no fullback or tight###end wants to block him , linebacker nick bellore said and quick enough to play coverage on the perimeter . the thing about what i do for them is , not many people are going to do it , pace said . go cover the tight###end , go do this , go do that . most guys do n't do that . everybody wants to get a sack . i want to get a sack . but the defense that we play in , i have to do a lot of different jobs that most outside linebackers either do n't want to do or ca n't do . sometimes , pace said , he has thought about being a renegade , about going rogue and surpassing his responsibility on a given call . but i ca n't , man , pace said . yeah , i might make a play a couple of times , but i 'd be hanging somebody else out to dry . it might sound corny , but i generally care too much about these guys to leave them out there exposed . i guess you can call me old school . you tell me to do something , i 'll do it . i might not want to do it , but i do it . he considers two moments pivotal to his longevity . the first involved a shift in attitude , and it came during arizona 's training###camp in , barely a year after he was drafted 18th over all , when he reached what he called the point of no return . buried on the cardinals' depth###chart , his roster###spot in jeopardy until a strong###performance in the preseason finale , pace vowed never to waste his talent again . he practiced harder . he watched film on his own . he turned to hot yoga , acupuncture , martial###arts . he began to view football as a year round job , not a six month hobby . without that rededication , he never would have moved to linebacker from defensive###end before the 2006 season . he shed 15 pounds and morphed into the brand of hybrid defender that is a valuable###commodity in a###league that , like pace , is evolving . his teammates and coaches marvel at his physical###condition , with ricky sapp , an outside linebacker , telling pace the other day that he could play , should play , another five years . pace does not know how much longer he will play probably as long as he is wanted , he said . the jets want him now , need him now , and that is why the no . 97 tile outside the locker###room remains###incomplete .
for the second time in a week , a high###profile baseball###player has been cited in documents linked to a shuttered anti###aging clinic that is under investigation for the distribution of performance###enhancing###drugs . yahoo###sports reported on tuesday###night that the name of the milwaukee###brewers slugger ryan###braun is on three records from the clinic , including one that appears to show braun owed the miami area facility , 000 to , 000 . in another document , the web###site said , there are multiple mentions of a lawyer who helped braun avoid being suspended for 50 games last year after he had tested###positive for having an elevated level of testosterone . the report also noted that there were no drug notations next to braun 's name , as there were in documents that emerged last week in miami new times . those documents linked a half###dozen major###leaguers to the clinic , biogenesis , and its owner , anthony bosch , and to the use of performance enhancers . the most prominent of those players was alex###rodriguez , who was listed 16 times in what were described as clinic ledgers , with various drugs mentioned in some of those entries . rodriguez has since denied having a relationship with bosch or being treated by him . braun issued his own denial on tuesday###night , saying in a written###statement that during the course of preparing for the appeal of his positive test last year , my attorneys , who were previously familiar with tony bosch , used him as a consultant . he said bosch answered###questions for his lawyers about testosterone levels and the possibilities of tampering with urine samples . there was a dispute over compensation for bosch 's work , which is why my lawyer and i are listed under 'moneys owed' and not on any other list , braun said . i have nothing to hide and have never had any other relationship with bosch . i will fully cooperate with any inquiry into this matter . bosch is not a licensed physician in florida , where he has lived for much of his life , and it 's unclear where he went to college or what medical###expertise he has . according to a person with knowledge of the matter , bosch 's name was never cited by braun 's side during the appeal process . last february , a baseball arbitrator ruled that braun could not be suspended because there were chain of custody questions surrounding his urine samples . as a result , braun became the first player in the sport to successfully appeal a positive test . still , he played the 2012 season with something of a stigma , although that did not prevent him from again producing strong numbers 41 home###runs , 112 runs batted in , a . 319 batting###average . now the question is what problems this new disclosure may create for him . the yahoo report added that the yankees catcher francisco###cervelli and baltimore###orioles third baseman danny###valencia were also mentioned in the documents they examined , but that like braun 's listing , theirs did not have notations about drug use . a career backup with the yankees , cervelli figures to compete for more playing time this year with the departure of russell###martin to the pittsburgh###pirates . cervelli denied any wrongdoing in a twitter message he posted tuesday###night . following my foot###injury in march 2011 i consulted with a number of experts , including the biogenesis clinic , for legal ways to aid my rehab and recovery , the message said . i purchased supplements i am certain were not prohibited by mlb . as more names of players emerged in connection with the clinic , investigators for baseball continued###efforts to get their hands on the documents and attempt to confirm the information contained in them . a miami new times editor said in a telephone message on tuesday that the newspaper had met with major###league###baseball officials and was considering whether to share the documents it has . a spokesman for baseball declined to comment on the matter . however , it is known that baseball officials believe that obtaining the records could significantly help them as they try to build potential cases against the major###leaguers so far linked to the clinic rodriguez , gio###gonzalez , bartolo colon , melky###cabrera , nelson###cruz , yasmani###grandal and now braun , cervelli and valencia . colon , cabrera and grandal all were suspended last year for positive drug tests . braun may draw particular scrutiny from baseball officials because they were angered that he evaded punishment last year on what they viewed as a technicality . their suspicions of braun have been heightened because the substance that he tested###positive for in the fall of 2011 an elevated level of testosterone is the same one that subsequently led to the suspensions for colon , grandal and cabrera . now all four have been linked to the bosch clinic by various documents as have two others , a teammate of braun 's at the university of miami and a trainer for the university who has worked with braun . baseball is also mindful that when braun appealed his positive drug###test , he was required to provide detailed###information , including the names of doctors and others he consulted for medical reasons . if baseball 's investigators were to uncover evidence that braun was treated by bosch at some point and did not disclose it during his appeal , he could be suspended for lying . however , no player has ever been suspended on those grounds since baseball , in , instituted penalties for the use of performance enhancers .
joseph levy was preparing for a season of scientific###research in antarctica last week when he got the call stand down . dr . levy , a research###associate at the university of texas at austin 's institute for geophysics , is studying the climate history of the dry###valleys of antarctica by analyzing buried ice###sheets that have been frozen since the last ice###age and are beginning to thaw . the research season in antarctica typically###starts around now , when things warm up enough to be merely frigid and scientists from around the world flock far south to conduct studies that affect our understanding of climate###change , volcanoes , the family life of weddell seals and much more . but with the united###states###government partly shut down , federally financed research has come to a halt for dr . levy and hundreds of other americans . even if a budget deal is struck , these scientists will have less time on the ice , and some will lose a full year 's worth of work as the narrow window of productive time closes . it 's like a biography of the earth with a couple of pages in the middle torn out , dr . levy said . nature will have taken its course , and we will have not been there to see it . the shutdown in washington is being felt acutely at the ends of the earth . some , 000 americans work through the antarctic summer , including scientists and support###staff from the private###sector and from federal###agencies like the defense and energy departments , nasa and the united###states###geological###survey . amid the battle over the country 's spending and debt limit , the national###science###foundation , which coordinates the antarctic program , has ordered it into caretaker status , which means skeleton staffing . all field and research activities not essential to human safety and preservation of property will be suspended , the agency said in a statement last week . while the agency said it would do what it could to restore the program once an appropriation materializes , it noted coolly that some activities cannot be restarted once seasonally dependent windows for research and operations have passed , the seasonal work force is released , science activities are curtailed and operations are reduced . that troubles dr . levy and many other scientists deeply . dr . levy 's instruments have to be in place and taking their ice measurements before the permafrost begins its seasonal thaw in mid###november . this is the third year of the project , he said , and it is sort of a crescendo year , in which past measurements of the ice under the mcmurdo###dry###valleys could be pulled together to make some predictions . we know where it 's going we want to know how long it 's going to be around , and we ca n't make that measurement , he said . this year we were going to put all the pieces together . now , he is hoping that a resolution of the budget fight might allow him to salvage half of the year 's planned research . while the shutdown directly###affects only american researchers , scientists from other nations have come to depend on the robust transportation and logistics system developed by the united###states , said alexander kumar , a british scientist . what is more , he noted , the effects will be felt beyond the inconvenience of a single summer . a lot of the science depends on year after year collection , dr . kumar said , so gaps in the record may damage data###sets built on decades of work . it 's tragic . robin elizabeth bell , a scientist at columbia###university 's lamont###doherty###earth###observatory , said it was impossible to gauge what would be lost because of the shutdown . though scientists build in time for delays caused by weather and equipment trouble , she said , field programs in a challenging place like antarctica do not have the luxury of building in contingencies for closed governments . samantha hansen , an assistant###professor of geological###sciences at the university of alabama , was set to leave for antarctica on nov . 4 . the government###agencies she would normally turn to for information are shut down , and she has graduate###students whose theses depend on what emerges from the dirt and snow of antarctica . we 're kind of in a holding###pattern , dr . hansen said . equipment that she put in place on previous trips needs to be serviced and repaired this year , and the stored###data retrieved by next year , the sensors could be so deeply covered in snow that the data , and hundreds###of###thousands of dollars in equipment , would be lost###forever . from a financial standpoint , it 's a big loss from a scientific standpoint , it 's a big loss , she said . frankly , the timing could not have been worse . still , some scientists remain hopeful that something can be salvaged . anne e . todgham , an assistant###professor of biology at san###francisco###state###university , traveled 30 hours to christchurch , new zealand , with two graduate###students and two postdoctoral scientists , and then waited through three days of weather delays to get to mcmurdo###station . they finally###arrived last wednesday , eager to get out on the sea###ice and begin their research on how some of the results of climate###change , like ocean###acidification , are affecting young###fish . five days later , however , they were back in christchurch , waiting for word that politics in washington had thawed . if mcmurdo reopens for business , dr . todgham said via skype , we 're hoping that we 'll be some of the first boots on the ground . in the meantime , she is staying positive i patted the ice when i left last night and said , 'we 'll be back . wait for us . '
los###angeles with last week 's pga###championship at oak hill now consigned to the record###books , organizers are preparing for the prospect of a july date when the 2016 edition of the year 's final major is staged . the pga###championship usually takes###place in early###august but , with golf reappearing as an olympic sport at the 2016 games after an absence of more than a century , the schedule for the four majors that year is almost certain to be revamped . although the competition schedule has yet to announced for the august 5 21 games in rio de janeiro , the golfing component is expected to make up two weeks , leaving the pga###championship with very little room to manouevre during a hectic late###summer . i do n't see how we can do anything other than move it ( the pga###championship ) up earlier , pga of america president ted bishop told###reuters . 2016 is also a ryder###cup year and i know the pga of america wants the pga###championship to figure in on who makes the united###states ryder###cup team . so for us to go after the olympics with the scheduling of the ( pga###tour 's ) fedexcup ( playoffs , i do n't see how that could happen . the british###open , the third major championship of the season , is generally###held in mid###july but bishop was not at all concerned that the pga###championship might lose some of its luster if it was held so soon afterwards in . i have no doubt about the tradition of all four majors , they are going to keep their place in golf in , the silver###haired bishop said . the bigger question is going to be , when 2016 is over with , is the impact of the olympics really worth the strain that it puts on the scheduling for the four majors in golf ? with the four major titles long established as the 'holy###grail' for professional###golfers , many have questioned whether the return of the sport to the olympics should perhaps have featured amateur players only . i have been kind of a traditionalist with the olympics from day one , said bishop . i always enjoyed basketball in the olympics , from a united###states standpoint , when it was our best college players who were amateurs not professionals . the interesting###question would be to ask one of the top pga###tour players or european###tour players , 'would you rather win a major championship or would you rather win a gold###medal in the olympics ? ' but until the format is a lot clearer to people on exactly what it is going to be in the 2016 olympics , it 's very hard to say what the impact of the games is going to be on professional golf . a playing format of 72 holes of individual strokeplay has been proposed by golf to maximize the number of countries capable of competing and winning a medal at the games , with one week designated for the men and another for the women . however , the international###olympic###committee does not plan on finalizing the competition schedule for the 2016 games in rio de janeiro until next year . first held in , the pga###championship adopted a matchplay format until it switched to strokeplay for the 1958 edition won by american don finsterwald . though there have been a few suggestions in recent###years for the pga###championship to revert back to matchplay to give it more of a unique###identity , bishop does see any need for change . year in and year out , the pga###championship is the strongest field in major championship golf , he said . it 's the only all professional field among the four major championships . we have produced a lot of drama in the last decade . our championship totally stands on its merits . i think everybody enjoys seeing players have some risk reward opportunities with the way we set the golf###courses up .
green###bay , wis . the injury hits just keep on coming for the green###bay###packers . wide###receiver jordy###nelson will miss the rest of training###camp after undergoing a procedure on one of his knees . he joins a laundry list of packers on the sideline , including left###tackle bryan bulaga , who is expected to miss the season despite his hope to the contrary with a###torn###anterior###cruciate###ligament in one of his knees . these type of injuries , they 're part of the game . the game of football , especially pro###football , stops for nobody , mccarthy said . you keep playing and if you ever stop and blink , you 're two steps behind your opponent . mccarthy said bulaga , who played roughly 30 plays in saturday###night 's scrimmage , was injured on the seventh play , but no one seemed certain of just how he hurt himself . he does n't even look like he 's injured , mccarthy said . general###manager ted###thompson said he saw bulaga come out of the pile after a play kicking his leg as if it was bothering him . then ( he ) goes back to the huddle and plays great the rest of the night , which is the reason i still have hope , thompson said . so does bulaga , who has reportedly sought a second opinion from renowned orthopedist dr . james###andrews in hopes of somehow playing through the injury . rookie fourth###round###pick david bakhtiari worked at bulaga 's left###tackle spot in practice tuesday and would start there in friday###night 's preseason###opener against arizona . we 're still waiting on a medical opinion that has n't come in yet . bryan is still hopeful to potentially give it a go , mccarthy said . nothing 's been finalized . asked if he really thinks bulaga could play through a torn###acl , mccarthy replied in part , everybody 's talking through , as we always do , what 's in the best interest of the player . bryan fully understands what it would take for him to play this year . he 's looking at all his options . pro###bowl guard josh sitton , who played next to bulaga on the right side from 2010 through 2012 before the team switched up their offensive###line and moved both men to the left side this offseason , said he thinks it would be a mistake for bulaga to try to play with the injury . if he does try to go ? i would think he 's stupid , sitton said . he 's got a career to worry about . it 's not just about this year when you have something like that , so it would be dumb . having suffered a hip###injury on nov . 4 that ended his third nfl season , bulaga had been ultra committed during the offseason as he shifted from right tackle to left###tackle . i feel terrible what happened to bryan and no one knows how hard he 's prepared coming off of last year 's injury , mccarthy said . i can ( count ) on maybe one hand how many days he has left lambeau###field . he worked out exclusively here in the offseason throughout the summer . so , to see him pour that much into it and able to see it , you feel###bad for the person . as for nelson , doctors expect the receiver to be ready in 4 6 weeks . the packers open the season sept . 8 at san###francisco . fortunately with jordy , his particular thing that we had ( to ) fix is something that we have some experience with with some other guys here , thompson said . so , we think we can predict about the way it 'll go . but you never know . in addition to nelson and bulaga , wide###receiver returner randall cobb , the team 's leading###receiver last year , dropped out of practice tuesday with a biceps injury . no . 1 cornerback tramon###williams has been sidelined for more than a week with a bone###bruise in his knee , and cornerback casey hayward has yet to practice because of a hamstring injury . dujuan harris , the team 's starting running back at the end of last season , has yet to practice because of a knee###injury . in all , 16 players missed practice tuesday , including wide###receiver sederrick cunningham , who was placed on injured###reserve to make room on the roster for quarterback vince###young . injuries are not explainable , thompson said . they just happen .
it was a few years back that richard###curtis the writer behind such artfully accented guilty###pleasures as four weddings and a funeral and notting###hill began to mull the meaning of it all . the occasion was a meeting with an old friend in london , where a casual chat suddenly took a turn toward the profound . we were having a conversation about whether we were happy , and as he asked the question , i was surprised to find that i said , 'not particularly , ' said mr . curtis , a still boyish . and while what was wrong was n't immediately###apparent malaise is often a moving###target it got mr . curtis to thinking what would be a perfect day . ten years###ago , we would have said , 'let 's fly to las###vegas , go out on a date with a movie star , get a phone call saying you 've been nominated for an oscar , win a million###pounds , ' mr . curtis recalled . and we both thought we 'd hate that day now . so it was that mr . curtis began to write the script for about time , a twisty , time bending tale featuring another friend of his , bill nighy , alongside domhnall###gleeson as a father and son with the magical ability to revisit and repair all the days of their lives . ( rachel###mcadams also stars as mr . gleeson 's love interest . ) mr . nighy 's character , a slightly loopy early retiree with a fondness for dickens and table###tennis , has the potential for being unbearably cute but somehow is n't . about time finds mr . nighy a master of arch and slightly off center understatement who is a frequent###collaborator of mr . curtis once again acting as a kind of palette cleanser to mr . curtis 's distinct brand of almost too sweet cinema smart comedies that border , but never cross into , the saccharine . mr . nighy is the bitters to mr . curtis 's vermouth , the slice of sharp cheddar on a warm apple###pie . and in about time , mr . nighy does so by consciously trying to do nothing at all . i wanted to make even fewer concessions than ever before to the fact that there was a camera there , mr . nighy , who is , said during a recent joint interview with mr . curtis at the mandarin###oriental###hotel in columbus###circle . that was the idea . i just wanted to do it as naturally and normally as possible and not get caught acting in inverted commas or making a name for myself . mr . nighy , of course , already made a name for himself , and largely has mr . curtis and a character named billy mack to thank for that . the film was love actually , from , the multipronged rom com whose most touching and funniest story###line was not romantic but platonic the relationship between mr . mack , a faded rock star and ex heroin###addict , and his lumpy and long suffering roadie ( played by gregor###fisher . it 's a role that mr . nighy seemed born for he is , in fact , obsessed with rock###music , particularly bob###dylan but was never intended to play . initially , mr . curtis , then starting to direct , had no intention of casting mr . nighy , who had built a respectable career but had not broken through to stardom . but all that changed , mr . curtis said , after a read###through of the script in which mr . nighy as a favor to a casting###director played billy . as mr . curtis remembers it , at that read###through , the only laughs were every line that bill said . in some ways , mr . nighy is an unlikely comic actor quiet , measured , self effacing and even more unlikely movie star . ( see previous adjectives . ) lanky and angular with fingers on both hands permanently folded by a condition known as dupuytren 's contracture mr . nighy treads softly when he walks , and talks , usually peering from behind blocky black glasses . his answers###to###questions about his acting can be painfully unpretentious . i just studied the part , he said , for instance , when asked about love actually . but that simplicity belies a deeper work ethic , friends and colleagues said . it 's literally the aim and goal of everyone in this country to work with bill , said ol parker , the screenwriter of the best exotic marigold###hotel , in which mr . nighy played a money strapped retiree . mr . parker said that mr . nighy has this extraordinary ability that everything he does is incredibly idiosyncratic , something echoed by christopher###walken , who recently worked###alongside mr . nighy on the coming turks###caicos , part of david###hare 's page eight spy###series seen on the bbc . mr . walken , no stranger to quirky characters himself , said he could see a power to the mind of mr . nighy . bill is one of those actors that i wish that every time i got to work it were with him , mr . walken said . his performance in love actually won mr . nighy several awards and led to a cascade of parts large and small . over the last decade , mr . nighy has been quite busy , including in big###budget franchises like the underworld series ( playing an elder , and altogether evil , vampire ) and pirates of the caribbean ( playing a snarling , slimy davy###jones .
you might not instinctively choose as drinking buddies two women who found fame with the mcnuggetini vanilla vodka shaken with a chocolate milkshake , poured into a martini glass rimmed in barbecue###sauce and adorned with a chicken mcnugget . or , dinner , dessert and booze in one chalice of multitasking , proclaims alie ward in the video that earned her and georgia hardstark a gig as the cooking###channel 's classy ladies . how classy ? the 1950s housewife channeling los angelenos met cute outside a dive###bar , where ms . hardstark was using her twirl skirt to disguise that she was urinating in a bush in the most feminine manner , she said . chances are that scene wo n't be re enacted in tripping out with alie georgia , their latest foray into cocktail wizardry , making its premiere friday###night at 30 , with stops at points of debauchery like las###vegas , marfa , tex . , and homer , alaska , where the man to woman ratio seemed stacked in their favor . turned out the odds are good but the goods are odd , ' ms . ward said . as are they , maybe just a little . we 're kind of like dudes in dresses , she admitted . we wear vintage because you can get away with a lot more when you look like grandma .
virtuosos often impress with their ability to produce unlikely sounds from their instruments . it 's such a pleasure when a pianist coaxes beautiful , singing lines from a percussive object and a singer produces trills and effects that seem impossible to have come from a human###voice . when a musician 's technical control is blended with almost intangible expressive gestures , a pause that perhaps a millisecond shorter would have lacked the same impact , or an unexpected and hair raising change in dynamics , truly memorable performances occur . chris###thile is a master of the soft spoken mandolin , rendering it a fitting vehicle for music from bach to bluegrass . at a solo###recital in october at zankel hall , he demonstrated an alluring range of colors and shadings in his interpretations of excerpts from bach 's sonatas###and###partitas for solo###violin . at the 92nd street y in february , the composer pianist marc andr hamelin again proved adept at wielding a jaw dropping technique to create inspiring results , his impeccable touch and shading resulting in wonderful performances of works by rachmaninoff , mozart and debussy . the best pianists are able to produce an alluring sound from any instrument . richard###goode , during a magisterial performance of late beethoven sonatas in may at carnegie###hall , produced a glowing , warm sound that encompassed a wide dynamic spectrum from muted intimacy to full throttle power without ever sounding harsh . as anthony###tommasini noted in his january review in the new york times of donizetti 's maria###stuarda at the metropolitan###opera , the mezzo###soprano joyce didonato 's performance in the title role will be pointed to as a model of singing in which all components of the art form technique , sound , color , nuance , diction come together in service to expression and eloquence . the soprano diana###damrau , in her debut###performance as violetta in verdi 's la###traviata at the met in march , also wielded her instrument to fine effect , singing with clean coloratura throughout and deeply expressive pathos in arias like addio del passato . musicians , like athletes , can face myriad physical###challenges . the tenor rolando###villaz###n certainly deserves###credit for rebuilding his instrument after surgery in 2009 to remove a congenital internal cyst on his left vocal###cord . mr . villaz###n , whose burgeoning career was curtailed because of the impediment , offered an impassioned and convincing portrayal in his comeback at the met , singing lenski in a new production of tchaikovsky 's eugene###onegin .
the action in the stadiums of brazil became compelling by midweek , but the protests in the streets kept on swelling . neymar , the home###nation 's hero , turned in another of his quixotic performances wednesday in a 2 0 victory over mexico in the steamy heat of fortaleza in the confederations###cup . he scored with a masterful volley but he disappeared for long spells . toward the end , he dashed between two mexican defenders , fooled them with his footwork and laid down the second goal to be scored by jo . outside , the police were using pepper###spray and force to keep protesters at bay . later that evening , italy came from two goals down to wring out a###4 3 victory over japan in the northeastern city of recife . once more the heat , humidity and tropical rain took players to the limits of their physical and mental stamina . italy 's willpower prevailed . but japan with memorable skills from keisuke###honda , shinji###kagawa , shinji###okazaki and yuto###nagatomo will be back a year from now , and nobody should regard them as pushovers at the world###cup . that is what all this is about . this confederations###cup is a small###scale rehearsal the 2014 world###cup is key . it is no coincidence that brazil , just like turkey , which starts the fifa under 20 world###cup this weekend , was struggling to subdue huge public###protests . they are developing###nations , spending billions to use sports as a showcase for their changing###political and economic###status . but there is a disturbing ignorance , at both fifa and the international###olympic###committee , about what people are saying on the streets . the protests are against governments , but the game is up for the stakeholders of the world###cup and the olympics . the people are protesting that these two giants of global sports keep on making their events bigger , keep on making the host###countries pay and keep on taking their circuses to places willing to pay for them . neither fifa nor the i.o.c . finances the multibillion###dollar stadiums , nor pays for the infrastructure , the policing or the military protection needed to secure their events , which stretch on for weeks . but it is fifa and the i.o.c . who bank the billions from the television revenues . the games have gotten too big , the price too high . yet as this week unfolded , fifa 's leaders , president sepp###blatter and general secretary j r me valcke , displayed bare faced audacity . i can understand that people are unhappy , blatter said in rio de janeiro . but football is here to unite people . football is here to build###bridges , to generate excitement , to bring hope . no country hopes for more from soccer than brazil . it has won more world###cups , and given the game more style , than any other nation . it has expressed its love of the game its obsession during both military###dictatorship and democracy . but these protests some not violent until the marchers are fired upon are specific in what they want . teachers are worth more than neymar read one placard . we want schools and hospitals , not stadiums read another . the protesters booed blatter and their own president , dilma###rousseff , inside the costliest stadium , in the capital of brasilia , at the opening###ceremony . yes , soccer unites . yes , it is a wonderful###thing that south###africa could stage the world###cup , and that brazil , after 64 years , will get to be host to a second world###cup next year . and it is marvelous that brazil , which exports more soccer talent than any other nation yet seldom gets to see these players in person in their prime , has this opportunity to see them on their own soil . the home###team players hulk and david###luiz and fred and neymar have started to use their social###media###accounts to express support for the protestors so long as they are peaceful . but their job is to do what they are doing , to win matches and to try to equal the standards that spain has set as the world 's best at the moment . spain has reiterated that this week , and not just with its passing against uruguay in the confederations###cup it also won the european under 21 tournament in israel . isco and thiago alc###ntara ( the latter born of brazilian parents ) showed that they are good and ready to step into the shoes of andr###s###iniesta and xavi hern###ndez the moment those great###players lose their touch . so , yes , bring it on . take it to brazil and see if the land of nearly 200 million soccer lovers can rise to the challenge . but , mr . blatter , do not dare to tell brazilians , as he did this week , that the protests should stop because fifa is giving the country improved airports hotels , highways , telecommunications , sustainability programs . blatter knows and the people know that his former boss at fifa , jo###o###havelange , was responsible for the corruption that should have shamed the world governing soccer body . havelange is brazilian , and havelange and his cronies were finally exposed last year as helping themselves to profits from a fifa marketing partner that went bankrupt . blatter , the head of a discredited organization , chose to lecture brazilians this week . football , he said , will always be a simple and beautiful game . fifa did not impose the world###cup on brazil , he continued , and the protestors should stop disrupting the spirit , the essence and the integrity that fifa brings them .

florence , s.c . brenda b . culick has two stents in her heart and a severe wound in her right leg , injured while she was doing home repairs six months###ago . but she cannot afford to see a cardiologist or go to a wound###care center . her household###income is , 200 a month , but she does not qualify for medicaid because she has no dependent###children and is not disabled . ms . culick , 52 , is one of several hundred thousand people left behind by south###carolina 's refusal to expand medicaid under president###obama 's health###care law a choice made by about half the states . if i could get medicaid , i 'd be the happiest person on earth , ms . culick said . in her state of the state speech in january , gov . nikki r . haley , a republican , said , south###carolina will not implement the public###policy disaster that is obamacare 's medicaid expansion . and she boasted of her stance at a recent rally announcing her bid for re election . when it came to obamacare , she said , we did n't just say 'no , ' we said 'never . ' the reality , however , is more complex . south###carolina officials say they welcome the prospect that more than a half###million state residents out of a population of . 7 million could soon gain###access to affordable coverage , even without the expansion of medicaid eligibility . and they are working to remake medicaid so that it does not just pay claims but produces measurable improvements in the health of poor people . even without a change in eligibility###rules , enrollment is expected to grow as a result of the new health###care law . the law requires most americans to have coverage , and state officials predict that the mandate will prompt more of those who are currently eligible , but not enrolled , to sign up for medicaid . consumers will see many advertisements from the obama administration and insurers urging them to obtain coverage , and that is also expected to drive medicaid enrollment . if they are eligible for medicaid , they should get it , said dr . william r . jennings jr . , a medical director at the south###carolina department of health###and###human###services . if people are eligible for coverage in the exchange , they should get it . mr . obama 's health###care law was intended to provide coverage in two major ways by expanding medicaid eligibility and by setting up an insurance marketplace , or exchange , where people can shop for private insurance . ms . haley and the republican###controlled###legislature here did neither . but state officials say they recognize that low###and###moderate###income residents will get insurance subsidized by the federal###government , in a marketplace run by federal officials . enrollment in the exchange begins oct . 1 , for coverage starting jan . 1 , but many who apply are likely to be found eligible for medicaid . state officials are bracing for the impact of the changes , the biggest in decades . the call center of the state medicaid program is doubling its staff to answer a flood of calls and questions about the federal law , the affordable###care###act . it is running a medicaid boot###camp to train new employees . and officials are rewiring computers to connect the state medicaid program to the federal exchange . state officials say that people who are uninsured more than one sixth of south###carolina residents should get any coverage to which they are entitled . as a condition of receiving their full allotment of medicaid money , hospitals in south###carolina will be required to check uninsured patients to see if they might qualify for the existing medicaid program , for subsidized insurance on the federal exchange or for other coverage . anthony e . keck , who as director of the south###carolina department of health###and###human###services is also the state 's medicaid director , said our goal is not to insure as many people as obamacare . our mission is to purchase the most health for our citizens in need , at the least possible cost to the taxpayer . state officials predict that , 000 people could get insurance through the federal exchange in south###carolina . and they say that , 000 people who are already eligible , but not enrolled , may sign up for medicaid . we will actively go after that population , mr . keck said .
a california judge has opened the door for the american###international###group to pursue a fraud claim of more than 7 billion against bank of america for losses it suffered on mortgage securities sold under duress after the federal###government rescued a.i.g . in . the ruling , issued late monday , is a setback for bank of america , which has been trying to rid itself of numerous legal claims from investors who bought mortgage securities issued by the bank 's countrywide financial and merrill###lynch units . in the california case , in which a.i.g. , the giant insurance###company , sued bank of america over fraudulent mortgage securities , the bank had argued that a.i.g . had no standing to sue because it had transferred that right when it sold the instruments to the federal###reserve###bank of new york in the fall of . mariana r . pfaelzer , a federal###judge in the central###district###of###california , disagreed . she sided with a.i.g . in a ruling that also raised###questions about the role of the federal###reserve###bank of new york in the wake of its efforts to contain the huge damage from the financial###crisis that erupted when lehman###brothers was forced into bankruptcy in september . a.i.g . said in a statement , as a result of the court 's decision , a.i.g . is able to pursue its full damages claim against bank of america . asked to comment on the judge 's decision , lawrence grayson , a spokesman for bank of america , said the court###ruling allowed it to pursue###additional discovery before the matter is fully decided . he added that the bank believed it has strong defenses to a.i.g . 's accusations . new york fed officials , testifying earlier on behalf of bank of america , maintained that they had intended to receive the rights to bring fraud claims related to the mortgage securities purchased by maiden###lane ii , the investment vehicle set up to complete the a.i.g . bailout . but in depositions in march , fed officials could produce no evidence that the fraud claims had been specifically transferred under the deal , as required under new york law . judge pfaelzer wrote to the extent that the federal###reserve###bank of new york intended for maiden###lane ii to acquire these claims , its intentions were not expressed to a.i.g . the fed 's view on who held the legal claims for fraudulent mortgages in maiden###lane ii has shifted over time . in october , thomas c . baxter jr . , the general###counsel at the new york fed , said in a letter to a.i.g . that he and his colleagues agree that a.i.g . has the right to seek damages under securities###laws for the instruments it sold to maiden###lane ii . but after a.i.g . sued bank of america , that opinion changed . last december , james m . mahoney , a vice###president at the new york fed who said he had principal responsibility for the maiden###lane ii transaction , testified that the new york fed intended to receive litigation claims associated with the troubled mortgage securities . bank of america filed mr . mahoney 's testimony in support of its position that a.i.g . had no standing to sue . yet in a deposition three months later , mr . mahoney was asked if he could recall discussing the assignment of fraud claims from a.i.g . to the fed . he answered no , i do not . the new york fed never filed any claims against banks relating to the a.i.g . rescue that might have benefited taxpayers . new york fed officials agreed###to###testify on behalf of bank of america as part of a confidential settlement with the bank that came to light in february . under the terms of the deal , the new york fed released bank of america from all fraud claims on mortgage securities the fed had bought . a spokesman for the new york fed declined to comment on the ruling . previously , the new york fed said it had agreed###to###testify in the case because doing so helped it obtain the best possible settlement for maiden###lane ii . while judge pfaelzer 's ruling added to the legal claims faced by bank of america , it emerged after the bank successfully disposed of several others . on monday , in the latest such effort , the bank agreed to pay . 7 billion to settle a long running dispute with mbia , a mortgage bond insurer . the bank could erase another claim on may 30 if a judge in new york state court allows an . 5 billion settlement struck between countrywide and a group of big investors in 2011 to be completed . investors objecting to the deal say the amount of the settlement is insufficient . the california judge 's finding that a.i.g . has standing to sue bank of america may also be bad###news for other banks that sold troubled mortgage securities to the insurer . a.i.g . has not yet sued other institutions related to the securities that went into maiden###lane ii at least 11 billion in losses involve other banks . we are eager to start discovery , said michael carlinsky , a partner at quinn emanuel urquhart sullivan who led the arguments for a.i.g. , and get the case before a jury .
east###rutherford , n.j . the preseason###game between the jets and the giants on saturday###night was meant to answer some questions for each team 's coaching###staff . most notably , could the jets rookie geno###smith play well enough to win the starting###quarterback job over mark###sanchez , the incumbent ? a less imperative question , but one that needs answering , is this can the giants' offense score some touchdowns ? in a tedious game that ended with a 24 21 jets victory in overtime , neither team got what it wanted . there was little competent offensive play by either team , and the ceaseless jets drama under coach rex###ryan advanced to a new level of bizarre . looking overmatched , smith threw###three###interceptions and carelessly stepped out of the back of the end###zone for a safety . and yet , by the end of the game , he may have won the starting###job by default . in the fourth###quarter , sanchez took a hard hit on his upper right arm and shoulder and left the game . his arm and shoulder were x rayed , and he left metlife###stadium without changing clothes or speaking to reporters . ryan said he did not know the severity of the injury . i 'm happy to get the win , he said . the giants' eli###manning , a 10 year veteran , was poised and mistake free but not especially productive . the giants scored a touchdown on their first play from scrimmage an 84 yard scamper by david wilson but they never crossed the goal###line again . worse , the giants' starters converted one of eight third down tries . a 32 yard###field###goal by billy###cundiff won the game for the jets with 8 minutes 4 seconds remaining in overtime . but the game will not bolster the confidence of either team , and the coaching###staffs are likely to think they still have many questions left###unanswered . giants coach tom###coughlin shook his head when asked about the errors of his offense . some of the things we did out there are ridiculous , coughlin said . whatever is going on with the offense , we 've got to solve it and solve it fast . the troubles for the giants' first string offense closely###resembled the problems they had in their last preseason###game , when they failed to score three times despite being inside the opponent 's . the giants' attempts to score from the jets' 2 late in the first half were representative of their struggles throughout the preseason . on third down , the giants first tried running back andre brown up the middle . no gain . then manning tried to connect with hakeem###nicks in the corner of the end###zone . the pass was batted out of nicks 's hands . i ca n't###explain it , coughlin said . i do n't think there 's any reason for us floundering like that . as for the jets , the quarterback who looked the best was the third stringer , matt simms . he threw a 22 yard###touchdown###pass in the fourth###quarter that helped get the game to overtime . sanchez was sacked on his first play from scrimmage and later fumbled a shotgun snap that was recovered by the giants . scrambling on another pass , sanchez threw on the run and was immediately hit by marvin austin , the giants' 312 pound defensive###end . after lying on the field for about 90 seconds , sanchez walked off the field , gingerly flexing his right arm as he made his way to the bench . smith completed 16 of 30 passes for 199 yards with one touchdown . he also threw interceptions of several varieties . in the first quarter , he threw a pass behind receiver ryan spadola that hit giants cornerback prince amukamara in the chest . amukamara held on for the interception . late in the quarter , smith was under pressure when he threw a reckless pass deep over the middle . it went right to giants free###safety stevie brown , who made an easy interception . in the second quarter , smith tried to connect with tight###end jeff cumberland on a quick slant , but smith did not see giants defensive###end justin###tuck dropping back into coverage . the ball came directly at tuck , who caught the ball for a third interception . in the third quarter , going against the giants' second team defense , smith led the jets on a seven play , 57 yard drive that ended with a 2 yard touchdown run by bilal powell . stevie brown , who had a breakout###season in 2012 for the giants , sprained his left knee returning an interception late in the first quarter saturday . tom###coughlin did not know the extent of brown 's injury , but he did not sound optimistic . i feel###bad for stevie brown , coughlin said . he planted his foot the wrong way . ... terrell thomas , who had not played since the 2011 preseason because of two serious knee injuries , was the giants' nickel cornerback in the first half .
( reuters ) once a conveyor###belt of tennis greats like bjorn borg , mats###wilander and stefan###edberg , swedish tennis now finds itself in the doldrums but two old warriors have helped lift the mood at the stockholm open this week . former world no . 4 jonas bjorkman , aged , came out of retirement to partner compatriot robert###lindstedt in the men 's doubles and joachim johansson , once regarded as the next big###thing before injury struck , made a rare singles appearance . both shook off the rust to win . bjorkman , who quit five years###ago , was approached by lindstedt after breaking up with his regular###partner before the u.s . open and jumped at the chance of a one off appearance . it 's not a comeback , just here in stockholm , bjorkman , who is also the tournament 's marketing director , said in an interview on the tournament 's website . robert is one of the best in the world and i hope he can carry me on his shoulders . the aim is to win the title . bjorkman , who won all four majors in doubles and reached two grand###slam singles semi###finals , and lindstedt beat fellow swedes isak arvidsson and andreas siljestrom in the first round and were up against ernests###gulbis and dmitry tursonov in the second round . johansson , nicknamed pim pim , rolled back the years to when he reached the 2004 u.s . open semi###final , with a 6 1 6 3 victory over colombia 's world no . 112 alejandro###falla . the former top tenner 's performance was remarkable as it was his first main tour match for four years , although he has performed davis###cup duties for sweden on occasions since . johansson burst through in , defeating andy###roddick on his way to the semis at flushing###meadows , but after reaching the top 10 the following year the shoulder problems that forced him to retire in 2008 surfaced . the 31 year old , who once served a then record 51 aces against andre###agassi at the australian###open in , will face one of the big###hitting new generation in canadian milos###raonic later on thursday . win or lose he has said his comeback is for one event only . johansson 's brief return masks the sad state of swedish tennis , especially in the singles ranks , where their top player is markus###eriksson , ranked 406th in the world .
washington ( ap ) americans spent at the fastest pace in five months in february , pushing up retail###sales by . 1 percent from january . about half the increase reflected higher gasoline prices , but even excluding fuel purchases , retail###sales rose . 6 percent . the report from the commerce###department on wednesday showed that americans kept spending last month despite higher social###security taxes that took effect this year . core retail###sales , which exclude the volatile categories of purchases of gasoline , autos and building supplies , rose . 4 percent in february compared with january . economists were encouraged by the stronger than expected gain in retail###sales . some said the increase means the economy may be growing faster in the january march quarter than they had forecast . this all suggests that the hit to spending from the payroll###tax cut and higher gasoline prices , which reduce the amount of cash available to spend on other items , has n't been too bad , said paul dales , senior united###states economist at capital economics . the recent pickup in both employment and earnings growth bodes well for consumption growth later in the year , too . auto###sales rose . 1 percent after a.4 percent january increase . the february gain was the biggest since december . sales at gas stations surged 5 percent , the biggest advance since a 6 percent rise in august . sales at general###merchandise stores , a category that includes major department###stores such as macy 's and big discount###stores such as walmart and target , rose . 5 percent in february . but the department###store category as a whole fell 1 percent . the solid increase in retail###sales showed that americans kept spending despite a payroll###tax increase that has lowered take home pay this year for most workers . a person earning , 000 has about , 000 less to spend in . a household with two high paid###workers has up to , 500 less . the economy grew at a rate of only . 1 percent in the fourth###quarter , but many analysts believe the american economy will grow a modest 2 percent this year . in a separate report , the commerce###department said businesses increased their inventories by 1 percent in january from december , an encouraging signal that they expect consumers will spend more this year . that increase is up from . 3 percent growth in december and the biggest gain since may . total business sales fell . 3 percent in january after a slight . 1 percent rise in december . retail inventories increased . 5 percent . wholesale inventories grew . 2 percent , the biggest gain in 13 months . inventories held by manufacturers rose . 5 percent . finally , the labor department reported wednesday that import prices rose . 1 percent in february after a.6 percent gain the previous###month . fuel imports jumped . 9 percent . excluding fuel , import prices were flat . low import costs have helped hold down inflation in the united###states . even with the last two months of increases in oil costs , import prices have fallen . 3 percent in the 12 months ending in february . export prices rose . 8 percent in february from january , pushed up by higher###prices for agricultural goods . in the past year , export prices have increased . 5 percent , led by a.4 percent jump in farm goods .
washington everything had to come together just perfectly to create the killer tornado in moore , okla . wind###speed , moisture in the air , temperature and timing . and when they did , the awesome energy released over that city dwarfed the power of the atomic###bomb that leveled hiroshima . on tuesday , the national###weather###service gave it the top of the scale###rating of ef5 for wind###speed and breadth , and severity of damage . wind###speeds were estimated at between 200 and 210 mph . the death count is 24 so far , including at least nine children . the united###states averages about one ef5 a year , but this was the first in nearly two years . to get such an uncommon storm to form is a bit of a goldilocks problem , said pennsylvania###state###university meteorology professor paul markowski . everything has to be just right . for example , there must be humidity for a tornado to form , but too much can cut the storm off . the same goes with the cold###air in a downdraft too much can be a storm killer . but when the ideal conditions do occur , watch out . the power of nature beats out anything man can create . everything was ready for explosive development yesterday , said colorado###state###university meteorology professor russ schumacher , who was in oklahoma launching airborne devices that measured the energy , moisture and wind###speeds on monday . it all just unleashed on that one area . several meteorologists contacted by the associated press used real time measurements , some made by schumacher , to calculate the energy released during the storm 's 40 minute life###span . their estimates ranged from 8 times to more than 600 times the power of the hiroshima bomb , with more experts at the high###end . their calculations were based on energy measured in the air and then multiplied over the size and duration of the storm . an ef5 tornado has the most violent winds on earth , more powerful than a hurricane . the strongest###winds ever measured were the 302 mph reading , measured by radar , during the ef5 tornado that struck moore on may , 1999 , according to jeff masters , meteorology director at the weather###underground . still , when it comes to weather events , scientists usually know more about and can better predict hurricanes , winter###storms , heat waves and other big###events . that 's because even though a tornado like the one that struck moore was . 3 miles###wide , with a path of 17 miles long , in meteorological terms it was small , hard to track , rare and even harder to study . so tornadoes are still more of a mystery than their hurricane cousins , even though tropical###storms form over ocean areas where no one is , while this tornado formed only miles from the very national###weather###service office that specializes in tornadoes . this phenomenon can be so deadly you would think that something that catastrophic , that severe would lend itself to understanding , said adam houston , meteorology professor at the university of nebraska , lincoln . but we 're fighting the inherent unpredictability of these small###scale phenomena . unlike hurricanes , which forecasters can fly through in planes and monitor with buoys and weather stations , usually over a period of days , tornadoes form quickly and normally last only a matter of minutes . while meteorologists and television hosts chase tornadoes and try to get readings , it 's not usually enough . this storm lasted 40 minutes long for a regular tornado but not too unusual for such a violent one , said research meteorologist harold brooks at the national###severe###storms###laboratory in norman , okla . still , the conditions needed to form such a violent and devastating tornado were there and forecasters knew it , warning five days in advance that something big could happen , brooks said . by monday###morning , forecasters at the national###weather###center , home of the storm lab and storm###prediction###center , knew that any storm that formed in that environment had the potential to be a strong to violent tornado , he said . this is a pretty classic setup , brooks said . tornadoes have two main###ingredients moist energy in the atmosphere and wind###shear . wind###shear is the difference between wind at high###altitudes and wind near the surface . the more moist energy and the greater the wind###shear , the better the chances for tornadoes . but just because the conditions are right does n't mean a violent tornado will form , and scientists still do n't know why they occur in certain spots in a storm and not others , and why at certain times and not others . on monday , the moist energy came up from the gulf of mexico , the wind###shear from the jet###stream plunging from canada . where they met is where the moore storm got started , brooks said . with the third strong storm hitting moore in 14 years and following roughly the same path as an ef5 that killed 40 people in 1999 and an ef4 that injured 45 others in 2003 some people are wondering why moore ? it 's a combination of geography , meteorology and lots of bad###luck , experts said . if you look at the climate history of tornadoes in may , you will see they cluster in a spot , maybe 100 miles###wide , in central###oklahoma , houston said . that 's where the weather conditions of warm , moist###air and strong###wind###shear needed for tornadoes combine , in just the right balance . central###oklahoma is a hot###spot and there 's a good reason for it , houston said . there 's this perfect###combination where the jet###stream is strong , the instability is large and the typical position for this juxtaposition climatologically is central###oklahoma . and the timing has to be perfect . earlier in the year , there 's not enough warm moist###air , but the jet###stream is stronger . later , the jet###stream is weaker but the air is moister and warmer . the hot###spot is more than just the city of moore . several meteorologists offer the same explanation for why that oklahoma###city suburb seemed to be hit repeatedly by violent tornadoes bad###luck . of the 60 ef5 tornadoes since , oklahoma and alabama have been struck the most , seven times each . more than half of these top of the scale twisters are in just five states oklahoma , alabama , texas , kansas , and iowa . less than 1 percent of all u.s . tornadoes are this violent only about 10 a year , brooks said . the united###states' great###plains is the best place on earth for the formation of violent tornadoes because of geography , markowski said . you need the low###pressure###systems coming down off the rocky###mountains colliding with the warm moist unstable air coming north from the gulf of mexico . scientists know the key###ingredients that go into a devastating tornado . but they are struggling to figure out why they develop in some big storms and not others . they also are still trying to determine what effects , if any , global###warming has on tornadoes . the jet###stream can shift to cause a record number of tornadoes or an unusually###low number of them . early###research , much of it by brooks , predicts that as the world warms , the moist energy or instability will increase , and the u.s . will have more thunderstorms . but at the same time , the needed wind###shear the difference between wind###speed and direction at different altitudes will likely decrease . the two factors go in different directions and it 's hard to tell which will win out . brooks and others think that eventually there may be more thunderstorms and fewer###days with tornadoes , but more tornadoes on those days when twisters do strike . tornadoes are perhaps the most difficult things to connect to climate###change of any extreme , said nasa climate scientist tony del genio . because we still do n't###understand all the factors required to get a tornado .
donating her file cabinet , full of old journals , letters and zines to new york###university 's fales###library archive was a bittersweet move for kathleen###hanna . a singer and founder of the riot###grrrl band bikini###kill and the feminist electro###pop act le###tigre , ms . hanna had been a den mother to contemporary girl culture for a generation , but she was still only a midcareer artist , too young to grapple with archiving her work . the donation helped legitimize the riot###grrrl movement . but ms . hanna , 44 , had more personal###reasons for securing her legacy she was n't sure how much longer she 'd be around . timing has played a big part in ms . hanna 's creative###life since she emerged from the diy scene in olympia , wash . , in the early 1990s . the brief but influential riot###grrrl movement seemed to arrive at just the right moment , during debates about workplace harassment and young###women 's sexuality , fresh issues that still resonate today . but over the last few years , even with a '90s revival in full swing and her view in high demand , ms . hanna had all but disappeared from public life . the reason for her absence , as she is just beginning to reveal , was illness , depression and artistic flux . i 'm still not sure , day to day , if i 'm going to wake up and be really sick , she said . late in , after six years of a mysterious and debilitating illness that often left her too weak to move or speak , she was finally diagnosed with late###stage lyme###disease . she underwent two years of intensive###therapy . now on the mend , ms . hanna is returning in a big way . she resurrected a 1997 solo###project , julie ruin , as a band , the julie ruin its debut###album , run fast , is to be released tuesday on tjr records , a label formed by ms . hanna and her band###mates . for the first time , the group is touring###nationally , beginning with a sold out show at the bowery###ballroom on tuesday . and a documentary about her , the punk singer , which has been making the festival rounds since it had its premiere to warm reviews at south by southwest this spring , is due to be in theaters in november . seeing these projects come to fruition at once is stressful but empowering , ms . hanna said . i am like somebody who maxed out their credit###cards because they thought they were going to die , she said , and i lived . walking through chelsea recently , she fretted about a girly bit of overshare . whether some overwrought teenage poetry was on view , in her bubble letter handwriting , at the fales 's riot girl collection , where ms . hanna donated her work in . that material and others were anthologized in the riot###grrrl collection , an anthology published this summer . ms . hanna further tells her story including sexual###abuse and naming nirvana 's hit smells###like###teen###spirit in the documentary , directed by sini anderson . footage of her bopping onstage in her trademark high ponytail masked her illness she announced a retirement of sorts from le###tigre in . the julie ruin was reborn during her illness , as a way for ms . hanna to connect to her artistic###identity . i was like 'is this who i am now , this sick###person ? this is n't me , ' she said in an interview in a cafe not far from her flatiron apartment , one of two homes she shares with her husband adam horovitz , a k a ad###rock of the beastie###boys . he encouraged her to sing as much as she could . when i would practice and i would feel o.k. , i saw me again , she said . she conceived the group as what she called her dream band , with players from different walks of her life on bass , her bikini###kill band###mate kathi wilcox on guitar , sara landeau , an instructor at the willie mae rock camp for girls , where ms . hanna occasionally teaches on drums , her friend carmine covelli and kenny mellman , herb of the cabaret act kiki herb , as a keyboardist and songwriter . they rehearsed casually around town and at ms . hanna 's new jersey home i ca n't call it jamming , because i hate that i do n't jam , she said without considering where it would lead . according to ms . wilcox , when she approached me to join the band , she was sort of like , 'we may never tour , we may never make a record , but we 're just doing this now for fun , because i need to . ' but ms . hanna arrived with some songs intact including one , just my kind , written for christina###aguilera and though she did n't have an overarching sound in mind , she knew what she liked . i know i love sexy surf guitars , i know i love loud snare , she said . i love really simple repeating bass lines , and i love weird mad###scientist keyboard sounds . mr . mellman , a musical savant and a voracious consumer of new bands , gave himself the task of keeping the julie ruin up to date . the last thing i wanted was for it to start sounding like a '90s revival , he said . the album , which the group created for about , 000 , is energetically punky , with new wave synths and beats . ( james###murphy of lcd###soundsystem mixed just my kind ms . hanna did the same for the single , oh come on . ) lyrically , the songs take a dark turn . the title###track is about tumultuous girlhood . party###city is defiant about death . there are several peppy numbers about euthanasia . it sounds really cute , mr . mellman said . then it 's like the kitten with the claws . ms . hanna said she has always loved juxtaposing the sweet and sad with silly . and writing without a specific political###agenda was a release bikini###kill and le###tigre covered that ground , she said , and a new generation of artists and writers , including pussy###riot , are taking up the cause . ms . hanna has found acolytes in the likes of tavi###gevinson , publisher of the youth magazine rookie . more leaps may be in her future . she is designing for an as yet unnamed fashion label with ms . wilcox . with her husband , she has created a tv comedy starring the downtown performers bridget everett , neal medlyn and murray###hill they are shopping the script . she thinks about writing country###songs and doing a one woman show at . being forced to take artistic stock because of her illness was n't###easy . i have to live with historicizing myself maybe a little bit too soon , she said . i mean , i 'm , i 'm not . then again , she said , it 's really freeing . i 'm not some young 20 year old ing nue who 's reinventing the wheel . in a way , the pressure is off . i 'm just happy to be here . her contribution has been documented . so now i can do whatever i want , and trust that i 'm a good artist .
notoriety was the key to headlining the governors ball music###festival last weekend on randalls###island . it used to be the making of a pop hero , and sometimes it still is . saturday 's main###stage closer was guns n' roses , the band led by a vociferous bad###boy of yesteryear , w . axl###rose . sunday 's finale and by far the biggest###draw , if tabulations by the festival 's scheduling app were any indication was kanye###west , the rapper and producer who has so often acted up in the spotlight and then written###songs about fame induced folly and megalomania . he had a new one on sunday , modestly titled i am a god . they both have long , tangled back stories that have become incentives for attending their shows see it live before it 's reported by the tabloids . and their music was set at full blast . they 're two generations of pop hero mr . rose stays shameless while mr . west is ( sometimes ) repentant . at governors ball they avoided the self destructive rants of past occasions . mr . rose came back onstage after his band 's big fireworks###display to announce , i love new york . and when mr . west got to the spot in his song clique where , he said , he usually starts complaining and justifying himself , he instead touted his artistic independence . we just made some real music , he said of his album yeezus , due for release next tuesday , going on to insist that he did n't care about selling a million###albums or tailoring songs for radio play . when i listen to radio , that ai n't how i want to be no more , he declared to roars of approval , though radio stations might be resentful . if mr . west was out to steamroll the acts that came before his 63 others over three days he came pretty close . his new songs relied on brutally stark synthesizer riffs and drumbeats , closer to industrial dance###music than to current hip###hop , and they were delivered on sunday through a sound system with bone rattling bass . most of his older###songs were remixed along the same lines all deep , ominous punch as mr . west shouted nearly every line . he spent most of his performance on a small stage in the audience , wearing a loose gray outfit that made him look something like a penitent for those who could see him , he was heaving back and forth , working up a sweat . but he set aside the beat for two long ballads with only piano###chords and his computer tuned voice heartless , about a breakup , and runaway , a toast to boorish behavior . bragging and materialism are at war with self###consciousness and self###criticism in mr . west 's songs a hero of ambivalence , he slammed home all the contradictions . guns n' roses , by contrast , unabashedly celebrated excess . the group , which now consists of mr . rose and sidemen rather than the band of comrades from its 1987 91 heyday , is larger , slicker and even more cartoonish than it was in its early###years . mr . rose and the band 's three guitarists struck rock star poses , songs indulged themselves in long buildups and guitar interludes , and the stage spewed fireworks and confetti . it was an older school of rock hero behavior , full of preening and bombast . yet once mr . rose got his voice up to full , abrasive yowl and screech , guns n' roses was the embodiment of nostalgia enhanced memories , a relic reanimated like a woolly###mammoth suddenly charging across the tundra . kings of leon , whose headlining set was rained out on friday , were squeezed into saturday 's lineup for their first new york###city show since . they did n't###play hero they worked their instruments and let their songs brooding southern###rock updated with hints of punk agitation or u2 's arena scale hooks speak for themselves . most of the rock###bands presented themselves with that kind of modesty . gary###clark###jr . , a blues rocker from texas , made his songs slash and scream and erupt with distortion , communing with his guitar rather than telegraphing the music 's drama . divine fits the songwriting alliance of britt###daniel , from spoon , and dan###boeckner , from wolf###parade did some clowning onstage , but never hid the rigorous neatness of songs that use every detail of an arrangement to tell their stories . deerhunter 's guitarists just stood there casually as they showed how two or three chords could swell into clouds of noise evoking specific eras garage###rock , psychedelia , postpunk . a different variety of postpunk revved up by breakneck , pointillistic guitar patterns came through in galvanizing sets by two british bands , bloc###party and foals . haim , a band led by three sisters from california , channeled guitar patterns into a sunnier style , like fleetwood###mac thinking about the feelies .
st . petersburg hopscotching from one democratic touchstone to the next education , voting rights , the environment and bipartisanship former gov . charlie###crist of florida announced monday that he would run for the job once again , this time as a democrat . on an overcast , breezy day here in his hometown , mr . crist , 57 , a former republican , billed himself as the people 's governor and exhorted a crowd of about 250 supporters in a bayfront###park to trust him with the stewardship of the state in . the voice of the people has been silenced by the financial bullies and the special###interests , mr . crist told the crowd as his wife , carole , stood behind him . so today i announce that i am running for governor of florida , and the reason is to put you back in charge . mr . crist spent much of his speech excoriating gov . rick###scott , who was elected in 2010 on a wave of tea###party support , as an extremist who cares more about big###business than the lives of ordinary floridians . governor scott has led like this embrace the ideological fringes , take care of his friends , bully his opponents , hide from the public and the press , and run from tough issues , mr . crist said . but his opponents were quick to fight back . soon after mr . crist began to speak , a plane buzzed overhead carrying a banner for the state republican###party 's new website , which featured mr . scott 's first negative ad . called he is an opportunist , the republicans' favorite description of mr . crist , the ad , which will be televised statewide , hurls the words of leading democrats against mr . crist , their onetime adversary . it is a reminder that mr . crist 's current supporters were once all too eager to point out his foibles and his shifting stances on issues . congressman kendrick###meek said , 'he ca n't be trusted , ' the ad 's narrator intones . al###gore said , 'it 's a little unusual to have someone flip###flop and then flop flip . ' who were they all talking about ? this man , charlie###crist . the race promises to be one of the most expensive and contentious in the country . mr . crist was first elected###governor as a republican in , and he governed as a moderate . in , he ran for the united###states###senate but lost to marco###rubio . in the midst of that race , mr . crist left the republican###party and became an independent , a move meant to sidestep his likely defeat in the republican primary . then last year he became a full fledged democrat . mr . crist will also be running for governor against a fellow democrat , nan rich , a former state###senate minority###leader who has a small but dedicated grass###roots following , although not much money . money will otherwise be abundant in this race mr . scott is expected to raise 100 million to try to keep his job . last time , in , mr . scott , a multimillionaire , spent 75 million of his own to win the election , a victory that surprised even republicans . republican leaders said on monday that voters appreciate mr . scott 's success in helping to jump###start the economy during the recession and his ability to bring much needed jobs to the state . he is doing exactly what he promised and that was , 'let 's get to work , ' lenny curry , the chairman of the republican###party###of###florida , said in a recent interview . but mr . crist remains generally well liked and is ahead of mr . scott in most polls . despite any misgivings over his party switching and his u turns on issues like gay###rights and offshore###oil###drilling , democrats have mostly rallied behind mr . crist . he 's our best possible hope , said gerald white , a tampa resident who works at the tampa electric###company and attended the rally . mr . crist 's republican past , mr . white said , does not worry him . many democrats have said they are deeply###disappointed in mr . scott , a fact that is reflected in his consistently negative approval###ratings . they say they disapprove of his early proposal to cut the education budget by . 3 billion , his opposition to president###obama 's health###care plan and moves they say he has made to damage florida 's environment . to that end , mr . crist said monday that he wants to restore the education cuts , advance solar and wind###energy , focus on infrastructure and push for tax###cuts on small###businesses and the middle###class . democrats at the rally said they are ready to embrace a centrist who preaches pragmatism above party loyalty . jeff lieser , a tampa lawyer who once worked for mr . crist 's senate campaign , said mr . crist 's high###profile in the state gives him a pointed###head start . the race , mr . lieser said , is charlie 's to lose at this point .
lake###buena###vista , fla . the cuffs on the sleeves of joe###torre 's dress###shirt monday were monogrammed with his signature just joe , no last name needed , a symbol of his status . but the championship ring he chose for his career valedictory suggested something deeper . on the day he was elected to the baseball###hall###of###fame , torre wore the yankees' 2003 ring , recognizing an american###league###pennant from a season that ended with a world###series loss . torre 's preferred ring , from the 1996 championship , needs to be resized . but he had other choices . he picked . torre , 73 , was unanimously elected by the expansion era committee , with his contemporaries bobby###cox , 72 , and tony###la###russa , 69 , and will be enshrined in cooperstown , n.y. , on july . the three men rank 3 4 5 on the career list for managerial victories ( la russa is third with , 728 , then cox with , 504 , then torre with , 326 ) . only connie###mack , 731 ) and john###mcgraw , 763 ) won more . the trio also won eight championships . torre won half of them , with the yankees from 1996 through , but he waited longer than the others for his first . his older###brother , frank , a former player , had advised him against working for george###steinbrenner . my brother said 'well , i know one thing he wants to win , and that 's the one thing i want , is to win . whether i last a long time or not is n't important . at least i have a chance , ' frank torre , 81 , said after a news conference at the winter###meetings . i said 'well , if you look at it that way , i guess you 're right . you should take it . ' torre saw the yankees as a chance to validate a managing career that began with the mets in , when he was still an active###player , and continued in atlanta and st . louis . he won his first championship in , realized he thirsted for more , and kept winning . he last managed with the los###angeles###dodgers in . the world###series victories made torre a celebrity . he attracted famous friends , like billy###crystal . coaches from other sports , like bill belichick , would drop by to watch the yankees practice . torre endorsed sunglasses and insurance and green###tea , and he has used his platform for a personal cause , helping###victims of domestic###abuse . but he came to realize that october glory only confirmed what was already true . he was a winner , even without playing or managing in a world###series in his first three decades in uniform . the hallowed john###wooden , the wizard of the u.c.l.a . basketball program , confirmed it for him . he admired how our yankees played , and it was n't the winning part , torre said . it was about the effort , running hard and stuff like that . i know he won the 10 championships , but he said the team he was most proud of was the less talented team that worked the hardest . it carries over into what you 're doing , whether you 're working 9 to 5 or doing something in baseball or in my case now , i 'm in charge of the umpires do the best you can . i mean , that 's what we tell our kids . do the best you can , and do n't###worry about it . if you do the best you can , you never have to look back . torre would refer to this often in his later years with the yankees , when his pitching was not quite good enough to push through october . control the effort . that was the message , and a major reason his teams won . steinbrenner 's payroll gave torre great###players a fact he readily acknowledged monday . but torre 's calm and reassuring demeanor fronted a burning competitive drive that his players shared . the yankees never missed the playoffs in torre 's 12 seasons , and almost always lived up to higher ideals . i really believe this joe taught a lot of us about how to win the right way and then lose the right way , la russa said . tip your cap when you get beat , but when you win , you do n't show anybody up . torre had a losing###record as a manager before joining the yankees , a fact that steinbrenner , who was not elected monday , often pointed out . but success was relative . less than a month into torre 's managing career , the mets traded tom###seaver . torre was only . he never made the mets winners , but he made progress . that will not be etched on his hall of fame plaque , but it helped him get one . i think that the best year he ever managed was the year he got the mets out of last place , frank torre said , referring to . they had absolutely nothing , and they got out of last place . the kind of games he won , i thought he did a superb job , but it went completely unnoticed because if you do n't###win , you do n't get credit . he was so bent on winning . la russa , who finished his career with a victory in game 7 of the 2011 world###series , spoke of the all consuming nature of the job . he would spend 12 hours a day at the ballpark , and 12 hours at home thinking about the game . torre , seated next to cox , to la russa 's left , smiled and nodded knowingly to his wife , ali , seated a few feet away . she smiled back . torre 's managing life is now over . his legacy , as of monday , is forever . torre needed the victories to get there , but he never let his rings define him .
chapel###hill , n.c . duke coach david###cutcliffe and his players talked openly all season about winning a division title and earning a spot in the atlantic###coast###conference championship game . on saturday , the no . 24 blue###devils made the once thinkable goal a reality complete with cutcliffe being carried off the field as his players celebrated with duke fans in their rival 's stadium . ross###martin kicked a 27 yard###field###goal with 22 left for a 27 25 win at north###carolina , clinching the coastal###division championship with the blue###devils' eighth###straight victory . duke faces no . 2 florida###state in next weekend 's acc title game in charlotte , where the heavy underdog blue###devils will go for their first league crown since . it 's easy to look forward to next week , left guard dave harding said , but right now i think it 's ok to kind of revel in what we 've just done . anthony boone threw for 274 yards and two touchdowns to jamison crowder for the blue###devils , 6 2 acc , who also secured the long###suffering program 's first 10 win season . devon edwards returned a kickoff for a 99 yard touchdown and had the game sealing interception with 13 seconds###left to turn away the tar###heels , 4 4 ) . that play started the celebration on the duke sideline . minutes after boone 's kneel down closed it out , defensive###linemen sydney sarmiento and justin foxx had hoisted cutcliffe on their shoulders , giving the sixth year coach a great view of his blue###devils mingling with celebrating fans in a corner of unc 's kenan stadium . it was pretty special , a great###moment , cutcliffe said . i do n't###mind these gatorade baths . our equipment people have to kind of figure out how to launder all that stuff i 'm wearing . cutcliffe inherited a program that had gone 2 33 in the three seasons before his arrival and had n't had a winning###record or reached a bowl since . he got the blue###devils back to a bowl last year . now his blue###devils eligible for a bowl in consecutive###seasons for the first time are going for more . he 's the first one to really come here when the team was in the dumps and say , 'i 'm going to change this program around , ' boone said of cutcliffe . and people were laughing at him . it all goes back to him . marquise williams ran for two scores and threw for another for unc , which had won five straight to dig out of a 1 5 start and become bowl eligible . but the tar###heels fell short on their final###drive with the chance to spoil duke 's title hopes . williams got them to midfield , breaking###free from a collapsing pocket for a 10 yard run on fourth down . but duke did n't let the tar###heels get within thomas###moore 's field###goal###range , pressuring williams as he threw a ball that sailed into edwards' waiting arms . i was trying to make a play , but i got hit as i was throwing the ball , williams said . give them credit , he added . they did what they had to do . duke beat its rival on crowder 's last second touchdown###catch in durham last season and has claimed the victory bell that goes to the winner in consecutive###seasons for the first time since . unc tight###end eric ebron had five catches for 121 yards in his final###home###game . that helped the junior who said monday he would enter the nfl draft after the season set the acc 's single###season###record for yards receiving by a tight###end with , passing maryland 's vernon###davis . duke led 17 15 at halftime after edwards' long kickoff return , which snatched back momentum after williams scored on a 1 yard bootleg 11 seconds###earlier . duke pushed that lead to 24 15 on crowder 's 7 yard td catch in the back of the end###zone , only to see williams find quinshad davis for a 23 yard score to make it a one possession game . the tar###heels certainly will be left with memories of a few late plays that let this one get away . among the biggest starting###center russell bodine picked up an unsportsmanlike###conduct###penalty for shoving a duke player after a play when the tar###heels had reached the 9 yard###line , pushing them back 15 yards and ultimately forcing them to settle for moore 's 37 yard###field###goal with 03 left . that put unc up only . and after unc 's tre boston dropped an interception from boone , martin 's kick sent the blue###devils on to charlotte . we did n't###play well enough to win a football game , coach larry###fedora said . there 's a lot of things you can look at in this game that we did n't do and we did n't accomplish .
london the british luxury group burberry said tuesday that its full year pretax profit rose 14 percent on strong retail growth in asian###markets , where the company is expanding its numbers of branded###stores . burberry , known for its camel , red and black plaid lined raincoats , posted adjusted pretax profit of 428 million , or 651 million , in the year to march . analysts polled by reuters had expected 415 million . revenue in the asia###pacific###region , the company 's largest with around 35 percent of sales , rose 13 percent , led by demand for more expensive products in china and hong###kong . burberry said profit for the first half of the current financial year , which ends next march , would be below that of last year as its focus###shifts to high growth latin###american and asian retail###sales from burberry branded###stores from wholesale markets , or sales through non burberry stores . retail###sales now account for 71 percent of burberry 's revenue . burberry affirmed earlier guidance that it expected first half wholesale underlying revenue to decrease by around 10 percent as the company reduces its activity in europe and in north###america . the company is focused instead on tapping appetite for western luxury in faster###growing , higher###end asian and latin###american retail markets . the company expects to open 10 burberry branded###stores in the new year , with three larger format stores opening in shanghai to serve local customers and chinese domestic###tourists . the forecast for strong###growth in china contrasts with more cautious recent comments on the region from fashion rivals like ppr , which owns gucci , and lvmh mo t hennessy louis###vuitton , both of which have reported slower growth in china . revenue in europe and the americas each rose by 6 percent last year , burberry said .
( reuters ) inter###milan , made to suffer the indignity of playing in the coppa###italia qualifying###rounds this season , sailed passed 10 man cittadella 4 0 as coach walter###mazzarri took charge of his first official game on sunday . jonathan headed inter ahead , rodrigo###palacio scored twice , including one penalty and andrea###ranocchia completed the rout in the third qualifying###round tie against the serie b team . italy 's big###guns usually sit out the early###stages of the competition as the top eight teams in serie a enter the fray in the round of 16 the following season . inter , however , paid the price for their dismal end to last season when they finished###ninth . jonathan headed inter in front from a fredy guarin cross in the 17th minute and argentine forward palacio converted a penalty after half an hour after he was fouled by simone pecorini , who was sent off . in front of a san###siro stadium which was barely one quarter full , the other goals came in the second half as palacio ran on to another guarin pass and ranocchia scored following a corner . mazzarri joined inter after four seasons at napoli , where he built a strong attacking side which twice qualified for the champions###league and winning the italian###cup in . andrea###stramaccioni was fired by inter after last season 's campaign , even though club president massimo###moratti had repeatedly said he was not at fault after his side were decimated by injuries .
until last season , when they faced each other across a football field for the first time , john###harbaugh had never rooted against his little brother , jim . except for the one time they were on different american###legion###baseball teams in high###school and john wants it known his team won , 1 0 the brothers were always on the same side , whether it was on their high###school###football###team or on the ice###rink they made in the backyard of their childhood home . on feb . 3 , the brothers , separated by just 15 months but alike in so many other ways , will be on different sides of the country 's biggest###sporting event when the baltimore###ravens the team john has coached for five seasons play the san###francisco 49ers the team jim has coached for two in the super###bowl . the harbaughs are the first brothers to be head###coaches in the n.f.l . there are only 32 such jobs , making the odds of brothers securing two of them at the same time slim . but for two weeks at least , the harbaughs will supplant the mannings as the first family of football , the title game serving as the next installment of a sibling###rivalry that used to include competitions to see who could throw a football over a towering tree and fights over which brother was scheduled to mow the big backyard lawn at their parents' home in ann###arbor , mich . the brothers , who had not spoken to each other by late monday###afternoon , do not seem impressed by their impending meeting . is it really going to be written about ? john###harbaugh said . it 's not exactly like churchill and roosevelt . maybe not . but when jim###harbaugh arrived###in###san###francisco to rebuild the 49 ers last season , he took with him an exhortation his father used to dispense to the entire###family . who 's got it better than us ? their father , jack , a former college coach to whom the sons still send game film , would ask . nooobody ! the family would respond in unison . certainly nobody in the n.f.l . has it better than the harbaughs do right now . in seven combined seasons , john and jim have never failed to get their teams into the postseason . indeed , the brothers act as if they expected this extraordinary confluence all along , indicating they are already tired of the sentimental story###line . jim###harbaugh said that playing his brother in the super###bowl was a blessing and a curse . we 're not that interesting , john###harbaugh said . there is nothing more to learn . it 's just like any other family . we get it , it 's really cool and it 's exciting and all that . it 's really about the players . good luck with that . last year , both teams lost in their conference###championship###games . this year , jim 's team###beat the atlanta###falcons on sunday###afternoon , leaving him to cheer on the ravens as they beat the new england patriots a few hours later . their father and their mother , jackie , watched from their home in mequon , wis . and when asked what his father might have been thinking sunday###night , john###harbaugh said he hoped he had drunk four or five beers . the elder harbaughs are expected to attend the super###bowl in new orleans , though , just as they attended the thanksgiving night game during the 2011 season , when the ravens beat the 49 ers , 16 6 , on the day before jack and jackie 's 50th wedding###anniversary . that the brothers have reached the pinnacles of their careers at exactly the same moment seems fitting , because their lives have wound around each other , fierce###competition and football since they were children . among many stops in his long coaching###career , jack###harbaugh was an assistant to bo###schembechler at michigan . the boys would go to practice , but they were also budding businessmen . they would take wristbands and write the name of the starting###quarterback at the time on them , selling them to their classmates as if they were all game worn wristbands . john was supposed to be the starting###quarterback his senior year at pioneer high###school in ann###arbor . but by then , jim had grown taller and better . he started as a sophomore and john switched to fullback and defensive back . john###harbaugh has joked that he dominated his brother for most of their lives , but jim had the far better athletic###career , going on to become an all american at michigan and then a first###round###draft###pick of the chicago###bears . john was mostly a nonstarting defensive back at miami of ohio .
raleigh , n.c . eric###staal noticed the date as soon as the n.h.l . schedule was released in january . on march , the carolina###hurricanes were set to play the rangers at madison###square###garden . it was definitely a circle on the calendar for me , staal , the carolina captain , said thursday before a game against the washington###capitals at pnc###arena . it was going to be a family###reunion unlike any other since the staal brothers from thunder###bay , ontario , began###playing organized hockey . eric###staal and his younger###brother jordan , now hurricanes teammates , were going to face their brother marc , a defenseman for the rangers . for the first time , three staal brothers would be playing at the same n.h.l . rink at the same time . it would be a lot of staals on the ice and not a whole lot of room out there , jordan###staal said . having three staals in a lineup in one game would be pretty###cool . i would classify that as a fun night . it did not work out that way . marc , 26 , has not played for the rangers since he was hit in the eye with a puck against the philadelphia###flyers on march . it could have been a devastating injury , but the rangers expect him to make a full recovery . he 's doing o.k. , eric , 28 , said . it 's just about the swelling and taking time for everything to kind of settle down . obviously , everybody saw the shot , how hard it was , but he 's continuing to meet with the doctors daily , and they 're giving him positive vibes and signs , so that 's a good thing . but he 's still a ways out with the healing###process and everything that goes with it . marc will not be playing , but the family###reunion will go on as planned in new york . the staals' parents , henry and linda , are flying in from thunder###bay , and eric and jordan will be joined by their wives for a get together sunday . linda will have another opportunity to counsel her sons on wearing visors . my mom 's on me enough , jordan said . it 's in the back of your mind . the only brother missing will be jared , who plays for carolina 's minor###league###affiliate in charlotte , n.c . the hurricanes have made a hobby of collecting staals . there 's something very special about the family , said carolina 's president and general###manager , jim###rutherford , who drafted eric in the first round in . three years later , he helped###lead the hurricanes to their only stanley###cup in . jared , 22 , was acquired in a trade with phoenix in 2010 and has played only in the minors . the most recent###acquisition is jordan , 24 , who came via a blockbuster###trade with pittsburgh in june . the hurricanes gave up the highly###acclaimed center brandon###sutter , a first round###pick and defenseman brian dumoulin , one of several bold off season moves they made after they missed the playoffs for the third straight season , and fifth of the past six . carolina also signed the free###agent wing alexander###semin and defenseman joe###corvo , who with eric###staal have been a crucial component as the team entered the weekend in first place in the southeast division and is a playoff###contender again . we were on a run that is not ideal for a sports business , rutherford said . and we felt that we had to invest more into the team , which we did , and see if we could add a couple of top players . semin has had the biggest effect on the score###sheet . entering saturday###night 's game at tampa###bay , he had 8 goals and 20 assists playing on a top line with eric###staal , who had 12 goals and 20 assists . he 's a world###class player that can play at the level of eric , coach kirk###muller said of semin . corvo had contributed 4 goals and 11 points in 19 minutes a game . and jordan###staal , who had 6 goals and 12 assists , has given the hurricanes another 6 foot 4 center to roll out on the second line . the staals had talked about playing together over the years . growing up , we wanted to play in the n.h.l. , eric said . that was our dream . then once we kind of got into the league and established ourselves and knew we were going to be here for a long time , the next best thing would be playing together and winning a championship and experiencing ups and down together . obviously , it worked out the way it did pretty phenomenally , and we 're excited now to be 1 2 centers on a team that 's first in our division , and we want to continue to push this team back to the playoffs .
in the most resounding referendum yet on the legacy of steroids in baseball , voters for the hall of fame emphatically rejected the candidacies of barry###bonds and roger###clemens in balloting results announced on wednesday . in their first year on the ballot , bonds and clemens , perhaps the most decorated hitter and pitcher in the game 's history , fell far short of receiving the necessary 75 percent of votes from baseball writers . bonds , the career###home###runs leader , received only . 2 percent , while clemens , who won a record seven cy###young awards , did slightly better , with . 6 . it was the first election since 1996 in which the writers chose no new members . it takes time for history to sort itself out , said jeff idelson , the hall of fame 's president . i 'm not surprised we had a shutout today . i wish we had an electee , but i 'm not surprised given how volatile this era has been . for a sport whose links to performance###enhancing###drugs have forced it to endure congressional###hearings , public apologies from players , tell all books and federal trials , wednesday offered a profound moment . writers decreed that two of baseball 's greatest###players would not be officially###recognized with the game 's highest###honor , at least for now and perhaps forever . the hall of fame will still have its annual induction###ceremony in cooperstown , n.y. , this summer . but the three who will be honored the umpire hank o'day , the owner jacob###ruppert and a catcher , deacon###white all died in the 1930s and were voted in by the veterans' committee in december rather than through the more prestigious route of being selected by the members of the baseball writers' association of america . ( the new york times does not permit its reporters to vote for awards . ) as a result , it will be the first time since 1960 that the induction###ceremony will include no new , living honorees , underscoring the lingering damage that the issue of drugs is inflicting on the sport . clemens , in a message posted to his twitter###account , said that after what has been written and said over the last few years i 'm not overly surprised . bonds did not immediately comment , but lamented in an interview with mlb . com in november that it 's tough when you have so many people out there who do n't want to turn the page and want to be angry at you forever . every player on the 2013 ballot was active in the years before steroid testing , which began , with penalties , in . some have escaped suspicion , like the top two finishers in this election . craig###biggio of the houston###astros , who amassed , 060 hits , made his debut on the ballot at . 2 percent , followed by the former pitcher jack###morris , who got . 7 percent in his 14th year as a candidate . others , like the former mets catcher mike###piazza and the former houston first baseman jeff###bagwell , were muscle bound sluggers in an era when many such players used steroids . they are viewed skeptically by some but have never been formally linked to performance enhancers , and both got more votes than bonds and clemens . 6 percent for bagwell and . 8 percent for piazza , who was also on the ballot for the first time . three others with more than 500 career###home###runs and strong###links to performance enhancers were essentially placed in a cooperstown coffin in the latest voting . mark###mcgwire , who has admitted his use of performance enhancers , received just . 9 percent support , the lowest figure in his seven years on the ballot . rafael###palmeiro , who tested###positive in , dropped to . 8 percent , the lowest result in his three year candidacy . and sammy###sosa , who was reported by the times to have tested###positive in , made his debut on the ballot with . 5 percent . voters can list up to 10 players on their ballot and are instructed to consider the integrity , sportsmanship and character of candidates , as well as their playing record . jack###o'connell , the secretary treasurer of the writers' association , said members did not have to follow those guidelines , but stressed their historical###importance . considering a player 's character , he said , has been there since the very first election of , and it is something that was emphasized by the hall of fame itself . nevertheless , the hall has long included any number of inductees with character issues , including , in particular , blatant acts of racism . the former pitcher curt###schilling , who made his debut on this year 's ballot with . 8 percent of the vote , wrote on twitter that he would have voted for bagwell , biggio , dale###murphy and tim###raines . he did not mention bonds or clemens . in a 2002 article in sports###illustrated , schilling told the writer tom###verducci that he had to be careful when patting fellow players on the backside because that was where they injected themselves with steroids . a decade later , verducci is part of the voting###bloc that will not support steroid users .
windsor , ontario assumption park gives residents of this city lovely views of the ambassador###bridge and the detroit skyline . lately they 've been treated to another sight a three story pile of petroleum###coke covering an entire###city###block on the other side of the detroit###river . detroit 's ever growing black mountain is the unloved , unwanted and long overlooked byproduct of canada 's oil###sands boom . and no one knows quite what to do about it , except koch carbon , which owns it . the company is controlled by charles and david###koch , wealthy industrialists who back a number of conservative and libertarian causes including activist groups that challenge the science behind climate###change . the company sells the high sulfur , high carbon waste , usually overseas , where it is burned as fuel . the coke comes from a refinery alongside the river owned by marathon petroleum , which has been there since . but it began refining exports from the canadian oil###sands and producing the waste that is sold to koch only in november . what is really , really disturbing to me is how some companies treat the city of detroit as a dumping###ground , said rashida tlaib , the michigan###state representative for that part of detroit . nobody knew this was going to happen . almost 56 percent of canada 's oil###production is from the petroleum soaked oil###sands of northern###alberta , some , 000 miles away . an initial refining###process known as coking , which releases the oil from the tarlike bitumen in the oil###sands , also leaves the petroleum###coke , of which canada has . 8 million###tons stockpiled . some is dumped in open###pit oil###sands mines and tailing ponds in alberta . much is just piled up there . detroit 's pile will not be the only one . canada 's efforts to sell more products derived from oil###sands to the united###states , which include transporting it through the proposed keystone###xl###pipeline , have pulled more coking south to american refineries , creating more waste###product here . marathon petroleum 's plant in detroit processes , 000 barrels a day of the oil###sands bitumen . residents on both sides of the detroit###river are concerned that the coke mountain is both an environmental###threat and an eyesore . here 's a little bit of alberta , said brian###masse , one of windsor 's parliament members . for those that thought they were immune from the oil###sands and the consequences of them , we 're now seeing up front and center that we 're not . mr . masse wants the international###joint###commission , the bilateral agency that governs the great###lakes , to investigate the pile . michigan 's state environmental regulatory###agency has submitted a formal###request to detroit bulk###storage , the company holding the material for koch carbon , to change its storage methods . michigan politicians and environmental###groups have also joined cause with windsor residents . paul baltzer , a spokesman for koch 's parent###company , koch companies public###sector , did not respond to questions about its storage or the ultimate###destination of the petroleum###coke . coke , which is mainly carbon , is an essential###ingredient in steelmaking as well as producing the electrical anodes used to make aluminum . while there is high demand from both those industries , the small###grains and high sulfur content of this petroleum###coke make it largely unusable for those purposes , said kerry satterthwaite , a petroleum###coke analyst at roskill information services , a commodities analysis company based in london . it is worse than a byproduct , ms . satterthwaite said . it 's a waste byproduct that is costly and inconvenient to store , but effectively costs nothing to produce . murray gray , the scientific###director for the center for oil###sands innovation at the university of alberta , said that about two years###ago , alberta backed away from plans to use the petroleum###coke as a fuel source , partly over concerns about greenhouse###gas###emissions . some of it is burned there , however , to power coking plants . the keystone###xl###pipeline will provide gulf###coast refineries with a steady supply of diluted bitumen from the oil###sands . the plants on the coast , like the coking refineries concentrated in california to deal with that state 's heavy###crude###oil , are positioned to ship the waste to china or mexico , where it is burned as a fuel . california exports about , 000 barrels of petroleum###coke a day , mainly to china . tony mccallum , a spokesman for the canadian association of petroleum producers , played down the impact of keystone###xl . most of the canadian oil earmarked for the u.s . gulf###coast is to replace declining heavy oil###imports from mexico and venezuela that produces the same amount of petcoke , so it does n't create a new issue , he wrote in an e mail . much of the new coking investment has gone into refineries in the midwest to allow them to take advantage of the oil###sands . bp , the british###energy company , is building what it describes as the second largest coke refinery in whiting , ind . when completed , the unit will be able to process about , 000 barrels of bitumen or other heavy oils a day . and what about the leftover coke ? the environmental###protection###agency will no longer allow any new licenses permitting the burning of petroleum###coke in the united###states . but d . mark routt , a staff energy consultant at kbc advanced###technologies in houston , said that overseas companies saw it as a cheap alternative to low###grade coal . in china , it is used to generate###electricity , adding to that country 's air###quality problems . there is also strong###demand from india and latin###america for american petroleum###coke , where it mainly fuels cement making kilns . i 'm not making a value statement , but it comes down to emission controls , mr . routt said . other people do n't seem to have a problem , which is why it is going to mexico , which is why it is going to china . one man 's junk is another man 's treasure , he said . one of the world 's largest dealers of petroleum###coke is the oxbow corporation , which sells about 11 million###tons of fuel grade coke a year . it is owned by william i . koch , a brother of david and charles . lorne stockman , who recently###published a study on petroleum###coke for the environmental###group oil change international , says , it 's really the dirtiest residue from the dirtiest oil on earth , he said . rhonda anderson , an organizing representative of the sierra###club in detroit , said that the mountain 's rise took her group by surprise , but it had one benefit . those piles kind of hit us upside to the head , she said . but it also triggered a kind of relationship between canada and the united###states that 's allowed us to work together .
memphis coach p . j . carlesimo stared down and quietly brought his arms up . the color had drained from his face . he did not say anything as his players walked###past him and took a seat at the bench . his look was enough . the nets trailed the grizzlies by 16 with six minutes left in the first half . carlesimo like the crowd here at fedex###forum could sense the game already unraveling , and memphis was only beginning to hum . few n.b.a . first halves look like the one the grizzlies unleashed friday , in the nets' eventual 101 77 loss . the nets stumbled , and the grizzlies soared , at times controlling the backboard with ravenous efficiency , as if rebounds were loose###balls on a football field . they scored a season high 62 points in the paint . by halftime the grizzlies ( 28 14 ) led by , and the nets were wheezing . the third quarter entertainment was provided by a dance###troupe of septuagenarians . even they appeared energetic compared with the nets . they were more physical than us , tougher than us , forward gerald###wallace said . this was a reality check . before the game , carlesimo had deemed the matchup against memphis a barometer for where we 're at this season . the nets , winners of 10 of their previous , felt slighted that none of their players were selected for this year 's all star game , despite the efforts of their center , brook###lopez . the grizzlies had only one player selected , zach###randolph . marc###gasol , the 7 foot 1 centerpiece of the team with the fourth best record in the western conference , was snubbed . it was gasol , not lopez , who played with the more obvious chip on his broad###shoulders , scoring 20 points all in the first half . seven memphis players scored###in###double###figures . the grizzlies took a 32 22 lead in the first quarter , on 52 percent###shooting , and they were just starting . in the second , memphis shot 68 percent , knocking down 12 of their last 14 shots . the grizzlies outrebounded the nets , 20 8 , in the opening 15 minutes , with nine offensive boards . they had 21 second chance points in the first half alone . a lot of it was just pounding on the boards and getting stick backs and second shots , carlesimo said . there was really just no aspect of our game that we executed fairly well in the first half . the grizzlies left in several of their starters , including gasol , until the final###minutes , even though they were ahead by . nets forward reggie###evans took exception to that , saying it was a sign of disrespect . there was a point where it was like , wow , evans said . it was shock . i guess it is what it is . if brook###lopez was dismayed about being left off the all star team , he was diplomatic about it . i was a little disappointed that there was no one from our team at all , lopez said at friday###morning 's shootaround . the nets had the best record of any team not to have an all star selection .
thousand###oaks , calif . the competition is so fierce , several good players steer clear of the tournaments . slow play is a continual problem . and the specter of cheating is omnipresent , with some golfers refusing to play those they suspect of trying to gain an unfair###advantage . on the pga###tour , par is not the only score that matters . words with friends , a digital scrabble like game by zynga , has gained an enthusiastic following among players and their caddies and families , raising the stakes of their downtime . in , two years after the game 's debut , the tour caddie steve hulka organized a yearlong tournament that featured 32 players and culminated with the coronation of scott###verplank . his name was engraved on a plaque displayed in the 28 foot trailer that hulka drives from one tour stop to the next . this year , 64 players took part and zynga donated , 000 to the first tee , a youth golf program supported by the tour , in the name of the winner , brian sullivan , a caddie who also won the 2012 tournament . a zynga spokeswoman estimated that 55 million matches were played around the world at any given time . words with friends is a good companion for golfers , appealing to their analytical and competitive natures and their nomadic lives . we have a lot of idle time on the tour , as you can imagine , said steve hale , who caddies for keegan###bradley . you can watch only so many reruns of 'sportscenter . ' the game is appealing , he said , for three reasons it 's smart . it 's social . it 's competitive . hale was standing on the driving###range at sherwood country###club before the start of the world###challenge , the event hosted by tiger###woods that ends sunday . he produced his smartphone and pulled up a completed words with friends game that he had saved for much the same reason a 20 handicap golfer keeps the scorecard of his career low round . on the board was queridas , which means darlings in spanish , a jackpot scoring word hale used to beat the golfer nick###watney . hale said he played mostly at night early in the week and in airports . according to statistics compiled by zynga , the peak###hour for tour play is 10 to 11 p.m . eastern on wednesdays . it 's kind of weird , hale said . as you get toward the weekend , guys get more serious about their golf games and do n't###play as much . caddies , many of them college educated like sullivan , who has degrees in psychology and sports management from the university of washington , have been known to make words with friends moves surreptitiously while their players practice a few feet away . on occasion , sullivan said , another caddie will approach him on the range and say , i just played one on you . his reaction ? if it 's a casual###game , sullivan said , i 'll go , 'o . k . , ' and pull out my phone and play a word . the tournament games are another story , he said . it is like the difference between a tuesday round and a thursday round on tour . sullivan will not play a word unless he can give the board his undivided attention . i 'm more meticulous and obsessive about each play , he said . building words is not so different from plotting one 's way around a course . sullivan approaches the game the way the free swinging phil###mickelson does golf , placing a premium on entertainment . i always like to throw out funny words , he said . i have this scrabble karma idea going . if i have an opportunity to play a fun word and i pass up the word for one with more value , i 'm sort of cheating the game because i 'm not enjoying the game . pignuts is one of his silly standbys . i 'll play a couple of nothing plays to try to set it up , sullivan said , adding , i have this massive dictionary in my head of weird words . in the game , as in golf , longer is not necessarily better . stewart###cink , the 2009 british###open champion , said my tendency is to try to spell out the biggest words . that 's not the way to win . sometimes it 's more important to block the other player . cink describes himself as a fair to middling player . if i have the chance to beat somebody that 's better than i am , i get nervous , he said .
paris air travel disruptions intensified across europe on wednesday as a strike led by french air###traffic###controllers broadened in its second day to include smaller labor actions in other countries . unions are protesting a plan by the european###union to accelerate the integration of air###traffic###management systems across the continent . france 's civil###aviation###authority asked airlines on wednesday###afternoon to reduce their flight schedules by as much as 75 percent more than the 50 percent cancellations it had requested previously . the authority said six unions representing nearly all of the country 's controllers had joined in the work stoppages . that left only minimal staff at control###towers in about a dozen french airports , as well as five navigation centers that help to direct###flights over french airspace . the impact of the french action , which began on tuesday and was expected to conclude by thursday###morning , coincided with various protests elsewhere on the continent that were initiated by affiliates of the european transport workers' federation , which represents about , 000 air###traffic###control workers . workers in 11 countries including austria , britain , italy and portugal held a series of brief walkouts , gatherings and minimum work actions on wednesday . eurocontrol , the brussels based authority that coordinates air###traffic in europe , said there had been no major disruptions at other european airports . but the average travel delay across the 27 member european###union and 12 neighboring###countries it monitors had increased to around 25 minutes by wednesday###afternoon from just under 15 minutes on tuesday . the added delays were largely the result of a request by the french authorities that airlines reroute traffic to avoid the country 's airspace , said nicholas wyke , a eurocontrol spokesman . flights that were still operating within france , he added , were facing delays of several hours . in a statement , air###france said the additional cancellations were primarily affecting its domestic and european flights . as on tuesday , the airline said it was making arrangements to accommodate as many passengers as possible with intercontinental flight reservations , either on its own flights or with another carrier . about 30 percent of the company 's flights are to or from cities outside europe . air###traffic###controllers are protesting the european###union 's plans to accelerate the integration of the bloc 's fragmented airspace , meant to improve transportation efficiency and lower the cost of air travel . the unions assert that the european###union plan will cost jobs and reduce the level of traffic surveillance .
shanghai lin lu remembers the day last december when a chinese businessman showed up at the car###dealership he works for in north###china and paid for a new bmw 5 series gran###turismo entirely in cash . he drove here with two friends in a beat up honda , mr . lin recalled . one of his friends carried about , 000 in a big white bag , and the buyer had the rest in a heavy black backpack . lugging nearly , 000 in cash into a dealership might sound bizarre , but it 's not exactly uncommon in china , where hotel bills , jewelry purchases and even the lecture fees for visiting###scholars are routinely settled with thick wads of renminbi , china 's currency . this is a country , after all , where home###buyers make down payments with trunks filled with cash . and big###city law###firms have been known to hire armored###cars to deliver the cash needed to pay monthly salaries . for all china 's modern trappings the new superhighways , high###speed###rail networks and soaring skyscrapers analysts say this country still prefers to pay for things the old fashioned way , with ledgers , bill counting###machines and cold , hard cash . many experts say it is not a refusal to enter the 21 st century as much as wariness , of the government toward its citizens and vice versa . doing business in china takes a lot of cash because chinese authorities refuse to print any bill larger than the 100 renminbi note . that 's equivalent to . since , the 100 renminbi note , graced by mao###zedong 's visage , has been the largest note in circulation , even though the economy has grown fiftyfold . ( the country 's national icon , chairman###mao , appears on nearly every note the , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 renminbi note . ) chinese economists and government officials often suggest that printing larger denomination###notes might fuel inflation . but there is another reason . i 'm convinced the government does n't want a larger bill because of corruption , said nicholas r . lardy , a leading authority on the chinese economy at the peterson###institute###for###international###economics in washington , noting that it would help facilitate corrupt payments to officials . instead of trunks filled with cash bribes you 'd have people using envelopes . and there 'd be more cash leaving the country . all the buying , bribing and hoarding forces china to print a lot of paper###money . china , which a millennium ago was the first government to print paper###money , accounts for about 40 percent of all global paper###currency output , according to a report published by the china banknote printing and minting corporation . adjusting for the size of its economy , china has about five times as much cash in circulation as the united###states . in the united###states , the highest denomination printed is in japan , it is the , 000 yen note , worth about the 500 is the highest denomination euro note , worth about . no major economy has limited itself to such a low denominated bill as china . by making the 100 renminbi note the largest bill , the nation 's citizens need more of it to buy a television or swiss watch , never mind a car , home or a yacht , which china 's state run media said was bought a few years###ago by men bearing two suitcases filled with cash . following those paper bills as they course through this booming###economy offers a fascinating glimpse into how china 's financial system works , and how parts of the country remain stuck in yesteryear . in large###parts of china , it still looks like the u.s . in the 1950s most everything is in cash , said jeffrey r . williams , executive###director of the harvard center shanghai and a former bank executive who has worked in china for more than 30 years . in the u.s. , you might have one bill counting machine at a bank , but here every teller has one . although china 's coastal###cities have flourished during the 30 years of economic###prosperity , economists say the country 's interior remains poor and disconnected from the more modern aspects of the financial grid . as a result , the poor prefer to do business in cash .
the boston###red###sox take their craft seriously . catcher david ross owns a special comb . first baseman mike###napoli has reached a###level of forestation so impenetrable that a family of squirrels could be living on his face . and pitcher andrew###miller has stayed true enough to the cause that he said his wife had given up the battle . the red###sox have done two things exceptionally well this season play baseball and grow beards . the team 's fervor for facial###hair has become a phenomenon in boston , where fans have once again embraced a winner . perched###atop the american###league###east since july , the red###sox left new york on sunday after taking three of four games from the yankees . the characteristic of this club is to grind all the way through to the end , manager john###farrell said . part of that has entailed surviving the itchy , scratchy and sweaty quest for the perfect midsummer beard . the red###sox are fairly conformist with their look trim along the cheeks with a bulbous bottom , as if a hairy water balloon were swaying in the breeze . for the team , beards have become more than a hobby . baseball players are superstitious , miller said , and it seems to be working . in the process , the red###sox have become high###profile poster boys for the bewhiskered lifestyle . phil olsen , the captain of beard team###usa , which competes at the world beard and moustache championships , praised the players for being stylish and pragmatic . good beardsmanship builds fraternity , camaraderie and friendship , olsen said in an e mail . my unscientific observation the red###sox' record improves with the length of dustin###pedroia 's beard . the red###sox' fun with facial follicles started innocently enough when napoli and outfielder jonny###gomes grew beards during spring###training . it became something more than a fad when pedroia , a second baseman and one of the team 's most popular players , joined napoli and gomes in taking a sabbatical from shaving###cream . there was suddenly the sense around the clubhouse that beards were not merely a fashion###accessory but a way to build stronger bonds after the red###sox' struggles last season , when they lost 93 games , finished last in the a.l . east and bid adieu to manager bobby###valentine . valentine was replaced by farrell , who was part of the red###sox' coaching###staff when they won the world###series in . farrell took the job with an understanding of boston 's unique clubhouse dynamics as a team that had a carefree spirit . that was most apparent in , when a band of self described idiots won their first world###series in 86 years . designated###hitter david###ortiz , who played a starring###role in , has cited the similarities between that the team and the current one the same go for broke approach , cohesive attitude and rebellious streak . if the red###sox adopted cowboy up as a nonsensical catchphrase to sum up their bizarre brotherhood in those years , the franchise 's latest###iteration treasures its assortment of pointy beards . it just sort of happened , pitcher clay###buchholz said after sunday 's 4 3 loss . we 've got a good group of guys here . guys who are pulling for each other . max baehr , a red###sox fan from brooklyn , is a member of the gotham###city beard alliance , a new york group that aims to promote###tolerance and acceptance of all facial###hair . beards , baehr said in telephone interview , are a tremendous way for co workers to build rapport , at least in part because they require commitment . baehr , 27 , said he put up with years of weird looks from young###mothers and unmitigated jaw sweating before he finally shaved in . he now has a handlebar mustache . as far as the red###sox go , baehr surmised that the players' beards were a sign of solidarity and a way to further separate themselves from the yankees , their clean###cut division rival . the yankees , of course , have long barred their employees from growing facial###hair . the red###sox encourage it . it 's a visual signal , more to each other than to anyone else , baehr said . it 's the idea that they 're having a lot of fun and support each other . athletes with facial###hair is not a new phenomenon . hockey players have long championed the beard as a postseason superstition . mustaches have made a handful of cameos in baseball , most notably with the 1972 oakland###athletics , who became known as the mustache gang . beards , though , have never had much staying###power .
washington when secretary of state john###kerry was scrambling last week to prevent the leader of the syrian###opposition from boycotting a meeting with him in rome a snub that could have spoiled his maiden###voyage as the nation 's chief diplomat he leaned on an old senate colleague to help him out vice###president joseph r . biden jr . after mr . kerry extracted an agreement from the syrian###opposition leader , moaz al khatib , to show up , mr . biden sealed the deal with a follow up call . the vice###president , who had met mr . khatib at a security conference in munich , praised him for his courage , told him how important the meeting was and promised to stay in touch , according to the white###house . it was a classic example of how mr . biden has used personal###relationships to amass influence in the obama administration a talent that current and former officials predicted would allow him to further expand his influence on foreign###policy during president###obama 's second term . mr . biden will shift to another part of the middle###east on monday , when he will set the stage for mr . obama 's first presidential trip to israel later this month , in a speech to the annual###conference of the american###israel###public###affairs###committee , an influential pro israel lobbying group . when mr . biden last spoke to the group in , he warned them you 're not going to like this , before laying out mr . obama 's demand , largely rebuffed , that israel stop building jewish settlements in the west###bank . this time , officials said , he will be more conciliatory , presaging a less confrontational approach during the president 's visit . biden has great credibility with the pro israel community , said israel 's ambassador to the united###states , michael b . oren . he has always been able to speak candidly and openly with us , all the while making it clear that he stands foursquare with the president . mr . biden , officials said , used his ties on capitol###hill to champion another unpopular cause chuck###hagel , also an old senate friend . with mr . hagel under attack over his positions on iran and remarks he made about israel , officials said mr . biden worked the phones to reassure skeptical senators and help eke out his confirmation as defense secretary . just as important to mr . biden 's rise is his role in policy###debates . with the exception of the raid on osama###bin###laden , which mr . biden famously advised delaying , there are few big policy deliberations in which he has not lined up with mr . obama . on issues like afghanistan or syria , his cautious instincts have prevailed over those advocating a more aggressive course . in addition to pushing for a faster timetable for withdrawing troops from afghanistan , he was also among those who opposed supplying###weapons to the rebels in syria a proposal developed by david h . petraeus , the former director of the c.i.a. , and supported by hillary###rodham###clinton , then the secretary of state . mr . biden was joined in resisting the proposal by thomas e . donilon , the national###security###adviser , with whom he not surprisingly also has longstanding personal###ties . besides being advocates of more aggressive policies , mrs . clinton and mr . petraeus , along with former defense secretary robert m . gates , each brought to the administration stature and independence that their successors cannot match , another contributor to mr . biden 's increased role . it 's not so much that he intends to expand his influence , but his stature will rise by default , said vali###nasr , a former state###department official who is the dean of the johns###hopkins school###of###advanced###international###studies . mr . kerry and mr . hagel are not the only biden allies to have prominent places in the second term . mr . biden 's top foreign###policy aide , antony j . blinken , has been promoted to be mr . obama 's deputy###national###security###adviser , replacing denis r . mcdonough . in that low###profile but powerful job , mr . blinken will help resolve###disputes between the state###department , the pentagon and the c.i.a . to replace mr . blinken , mr . biden last week hired jacob j . sullivan , a rising###star who was a top adviser to mrs . clinton . mr . sullivan , 36 , who traveled with the secretary of state while serving as the state###department 's policy###planning director , has deep experience on issues like the arab uprisings and china . the recruitment of mr . sullivan which included a phone call to him from mr . obama on air###force one was noted in political###circles because if mrs . clinton were to run for president again in , he would be likely to work on her campaign , as he did in . mr . biden has conspicuously refused to rule out his own run for the presidency . mr . obama gave mr . biden his own turf in the first term by handing him the iraq portfolio , and the vice###president helped engineer the brisk american withdrawal from that war . but with iraq receding as an issue for the united###states , the question is what turf might mr . biden try to claim now ? china offers a tantalizing possibility , given that he has cultivated ties to its incoming leader , xi###jinping . mr . biden spent###hours with mr . xi , the chinese vice###president , in china in , and again last year when he played host to him in washington . with mr . xi slated to become president at the end of the national people 's congress in beijing , mr . obama will become his official counterpart . but mr . biden 's relationship with mr . xi , officials said , would give him an insight into china 's leadership that could expand his role informally . mrs . clinton and the former treasury###secretary , timothy f . geithner , each staked their claim to china through an annual meeting known as the strategic and economic dialogue . while that dialogue is expected to continue , neither mr . kerry nor the new treasury###secretary , jacob j . lew , has the china experience that they did . there is reasonable speculation about whether kerry and lew are going to be hillary geithner redux , said jeffrey a . bader , a senior director for asia at the national###security###council from 2009 to . mr . biden 's aides declined to comment on his foreign###policy aspirations , saying he was immersed in efforts to pass gun###control laws . they were less concerned with mr . xi last week than his meeting with mayor michael r . bloomberg of new york . but for a white###house intent on controlling foreign###policy , an enhanced role for the vice###president raises few qualms . biden is very closely###integrated into the foreign###policy portfolio , said benjamin j . rhodes , a deputy###national###security###adviser . he 's a key###player that can take on specific###issues , build specific relationships .
chicago paul###konerko is not a crusader . he never has been , and he is not comfortable being cast in the role . he is a ballplayer , studious about the art of hitting , professional in his demeanor , and he would prefer to leave it at that . but it is always good to be on the right side of history , whether or not you thought much about it at the time . and that is where konerko was , a decade###ago , when 16 members of the chicago###white###sox initially###planned to boycott their drug tests to help ensure more meaningful tests in the future . i do n't###remember it being that big a deal , konerko said on tuesday by his locker before batting practice at u.s . cellular###field . if i remember anything about it , it 's that it got made into something , which i guess is not a bad###thing . but it was more like guys did n't care , and if they did n't have to do it , it went down as a positive , and that was fine . konerko was at first base monday when alex###rodriguez arrived there safely with a single in his first at bat of the season for the yankees . it came on the day baseball suspended rodriguez 211 games for violating its drug policy and obstructing its biogenesis investigation , which has resulted in shorter suspensions for 13 others . rodriguez is appealing the punishment . the players union first agreed to test for steroids in the labor negotiations of , after ken###caminiti , a former most valuable###player for the san###diego###padres , admitted his use to sports###illustrated . caminiti 's admission put a face to a problem within baseball that was widely###suspected but never confirmed . cries for a testing###program grew harder to ignore . it was a bargaining###chip with ownership , and ownership had a vested interest in keeping the game clean , said kelly wunsch , a retired pitcher who was then the white###sox' player representative . i know people say ownership turned a blind###eye to it , and they probably did in some circumstances . but people were going to start losing interest in watching a bunch of clowns out there on drugs , doing things normal people could n't even think about doing . they had always tried to get a little bit more testing with each collective###bargaining###agreement , and at that point , an incident like caminiti 's really put a lot of public pressure on both sides to at least give a nod to what was going on . that acknowledgment came in the form of anonymous survey testing , as it was called , to be done during spring###training in . if more than 5 percent of the players tested###positive , mandatory random testing , with penalties , would begin in . a refusal to take the test would have counted as a positive . that idea appealed to many of the white###sox because they wanted to reach the 5 percent###threshold to ensure future testing . but when wunsch spoke to union leaders in new york , they told him a boycott would be inconsistent with the agreement . the players took the tests , wunsch said , and , of course , it was much ado about nothing . we had plenty of positives to put us over the trigger . years later , one of those positives was found to have belonged to rodriguez , who admitted to using steroids from 2001 to 2003 while playing for the texas###rangers . that season , essentially , was a bridge year for the users a last chance to take steroids without risking discipline . as wunsch recalled , the older###generation was reluctant to let go . for some of the older###players , the meat of their careers had been in that sort of wild###west , wunsch said . they probably did n't want to see it end it was fine for them . like any kind of social###change , it 's the younger###generation that pushes things , and that was very much in line with what we encountered 10 years###ago . it was older###players saying , 'hey , what the hell do y'all think you 're doing ? ' it was a do n't rock the boat mentality . wunsch , now , played only six seasons in the majors . his best was his first , in , when he led american###league pitchers in appearances with 83 and had a . 93 earned###run###average . by , when he was , injuries had diminished wunsch 's effectiveness and his fastball had lost its zip . he understood the mentality so common just a few years before , how easy it would have been to get a chemical edge . luckily , or unluckily , there was already drug###testing at that point , so it was off the table for me , wunsch said . the thinking was that your career could have lasted###longer , and therein lies the problem you did n't###feel you could leave it all on the field unless you used p.e.d . 's . the fact that there is testing in place has cleaned up the game , to a large###extent , but we all know if people can dope in the olympics or the tour de france as much as they do , the odds of it being a fully clean sport are pretty low . that suspicion became a sobering reality with the biogenesis suspensions . wunsch , who runs a custom home building company in austin , tex . , coaches his sons in baseball but rarely watches major###league games anymore . he still does not believe everything he sees . when i was young , it was a generational phenomenon to see a guy throwing 100 miles an hour , wunsch said . now there 's a half###dozen guys doing it . you get to the point where you think , 'hmm maybe . ' it takes some of the awe and wonderment out of what these people can do . you hate to think that way , because there are some who are doing it clean , and god love 'em if they do it 's fantastic . but you ca n't help but be skeptical , and that 's unfortunate . the better , the stricter and the more all encompassing the testing can be , the more we can relax , sit back and enjoy these athletes . the union plans to revisit the drug program this winter , and stricter penalties will be discussed . konerko , an advocate of fair play a decade###ago , offered no opinion on that , saying smarter people would decide . but he is pleased with the direction of a testing###program , and said it would continue to evolve from its simplistic beginnings . you have to look at it big###picture , konerko said . what it looks like right now is n't what it looked like eight years###ago , and it probably wo n't be what it looks like eight years from now . but if it 's constantly getting better , it 's good . that 's all you can do .
oakland , calif . at first glance , it looked like a lopsided pitching matchup in favor of the detroit###tigers . they had justin###verlander , baseball 's highest###paid pitcher , going against a 23 year old july call up named sonny . but sonny douglas gray , a former vanderbilt star and 2011 oakland a 's first###round###draft###pick , matched verlander zero for zero and even posted an eighth scoreless###inning to verlander 's seven . but it was not until both starters were gone that the oakland a 's broke through in the bottom of the ninth###inning against detroit 's bullpen for a tense 1 0 victory on saturday###night at o . co coliseum . after leadoff###singles by yoenis cespedes and seth###smith off al albuquerque and an intentional###walk to josh###reddick , stephen vogt lined a single into left center off rick###porcello to even the american###league###division###series at , with game 3 in detroit on monday . if the a 's manage to win the series , there will be much talk about the night gray held his own against verlander , with a four hit , nine strikeout performance . for a 23 year old kid on the stage he was on tonight , you ca n't say enough , said vogt , who played with gray this season at class###aaa sacramento in the pacific###coast###league . gray , whose size and pitching motion are reminiscent of a young david###cone , made an instant believer of tigers' manager jim###leyland . the guy was terrific , leyland said . he was aggressive , did n't back off one second . but let 's not forget what verlander did . this was postseason pitching that 's what you saw tonight at its best . much discussion around baseball had focused on verlander as the season progressed and it became apparent that he was not having a particularly good one , by his 2011 standards . from a 24 5 record with a . 40 earned###run###average two years###ago , verlander finished the 2013 regular###season with corresponding numbers of 13 12 and . 46 . on friday , he readily conceded that teammate max###scherzer was without a doubt the best pitcher in the american###league and deserved to start game . as for himself , he added we are n't robots , things are n't always perfect and this is a season that opened my eyes to that fact . more eye###opening was his diminished performance in the aftermath of signing a seven year , 180 million contract . verlander seemed to be one more blatant example of overindulgence , with the long###term contract for a 30 year old pitcher even more of a cautionary###tale than for sluggers like alex###rodriguez and albert###pujols . but verlander also was also of the opinion that he had worked out his problems over his last few starts and was where i needed to be . nothing he did to start the game suggested he was kidding himself . he retired the first 11 oakland hitters and only one , sogard , hit the ball hard . but gray , too , was sharp , throwing in the mid 90s . he limited the tigers to two hits through four innings a sharp single to left by a limping miguel###cabrera and an infield single by don kelly . both teams failed to exploit scoring###chances in the fifth . with runners at first and third and one out , austin###jackson struck out swinging and a 's catcher vogt made a brilliant throw to nail the speedy jose iglesias trying to steal second to strand omar###infante at third . that turned out to be the tigers' best opportunity . the a 's promptly got back to back singles from cespedes and smith against verlander to start the bottom of the fifth . but reddick popped up a sacrifice###bunt attempt and verlander struck out vogt and sogard . the a 's threatened again in the seventh , with runners at second and third and two out . vogt battled verlander through a 10 pitch at bat before striking out on a 98 mile per hour fastball . verlander 's 117th pitch of the game was his fastest , and last . verlander admitted he was surprised by how resolute gray was , inning after inning . the biggest game of his career , he said . he had to have a lot of angst and nerves . but he handled himself like a veteran . vogt , however , said he had seen enough of gray in the minors and in oakland to expect him to not be overwhelmed . you could tell in the bullpen he was going to have a great night , vogt said . gray said he tried to put the verlander matchup out of his mind , focusing on the tigers' hitters . i was n't looking at it like i was facing justin###verlander , he said . because if you do that , one of their hitters is going to get you . in the end , gray allowed only five balls out of the infield and made a name for himself on a national stage . but while he was at least verlander 's equal , it will be a while before he makes more than a fraction of verlander 's salary . gray will not be eligible for unrestricted free###agency until 2019 just about the time verlander 's contract is set to expire . verlander followed him into the interview room after the game and told him , good job . it was better than that . it made the series a tossup , although a 's manager bob###melvin would only say , certainly makes for a nicer flight when you win a game . he could thank vogt for his fifth inning throw and his game winning hit . but first and foremost , the night belonged to sonny###gray .
new york at least for a few days , the baseball order in new york has been reversed . some might have predicted a subway###series sweep but by the yankees , not the mets . instead , dillon###gee finished off the first sweep by the upstarts from queens over their older , more renowned rival , which could n't have come at a more unexpected time . gee struck out a career###high 12 and limited the yankees to four hits over 7 1 3 innings in a 3 1 victory thursday###night that completed the mets' four game smothering of their famous foe from the bronx . it 's always fun to win this series , especially for our fans , mets captain david###wright said . it gives our fans some bragging###rights . marlon###byrd had a two run , second deck homer in the second off rookie vidal nuno , john###buck hit a slow rolling rbi single off third base in the eighth and gee made that stand up with a start that may have saved his job . you 're playing as hard as you always do , but you know it 's something special for the fans , byrd said . we ca n't go on the road and let up . we have to keep going hard , like we did here . the yankees were outscored 16 7 in the sweep and went 5 for . 218 ) with runners in scoring###position . mets starters were 4 0 with a . 91 era . does it mean any more that it 's against the yankees ? had we been playing better , yeah , it would have been huge . but right now we 've just got to win some games , and it did n't matter who it was , mets manager terry###collins said . it establishes a mood in the clubhouse that , you know what , we 're not that bad . since the start of interleague###play in , the only subway###series sweep had been by the yankees , when they went 6 0 in . it 's hard when you lose to your crosstown###rivals , yankees manager joe###girardi said . you do n't want to be part of a team that gets swept by your crosstown###rivals . over time , it 's going to happen , but you do n't want to be the team that it happens to . the yankees began the week leading the al###east at . and the mets , who had never won four straight over the yankees , were fourth in the nl###east at . but the met extended a winning###streak to five for the first time since may 5 9 last year . and the yankees have lost five in a row in a single season for the first time since a six game slide from may , 2011 . i tried everything that i knew to try and it was n't###working the pats on the back , the 'hang with them , ' he said . so you just had to say , 'hey look , it 's got to be now . it 's got to be stepped up right this minute , ' and they did it . using a sharp slider , pinpoint changeup and a fastball in the upper 80s , gee ( 3 6 ) did n't go to three balls on a single batter , threw 63 of 88 pitches for strikes and retired his final 15 in a row . collins had told him his rotation spot was in jeopardy . he said , 'good job' for once when i came out of the game , gee said . it 's hard to put into words . i needed that on so many levels it 's crazy . the mets tied a franchise###record by going three straight###games without allowing a walk , the first time they 've accomplished the feat since july , 1994 , according to stats . yankees batters , usually patient , have gone three games without a free pass for the first time since june , 1991 , when kevin maas was their cleanup###hitter . while gee was n't missing the plate , he was missing something whiskers . since he pitched against atlanta last weekend , gee shaved off his beard and mustache . he escaped two on , no outs trouble in both the first and second innings , and then allowed just one more runner on robinson cano 's one out homer in the third , his 14th of the year . gee and his bullpen then retired the yankees' last 20 batters . he did n't get many balls over the middle of the plate , gardner said . scott rice got the final two outs of the eighth , and bobby parnell finished the four hitter for his ninth save in 11 chances . now the mets just have to play like this the rest of the time . it 's a lot more fun to come to the ballpark . guys are smiling , laughing , having a good time , playing a little more loosely , wright said . when you go out there and you feel like you have to play perfect to win games , that 's when you get a little tense and start making some silly mistakes . notes the rivals played three games apiece in 1997 and ' , then six regular###season###games a year through . the yankees brushed past the mets 4 1 in the 2000 world###series for their third straight title . ... quintanilla was brought up from triple a to take the roster###spot of ruben tejada , who went on the dl with a strained right quadriceps . quintanilla flubbed his first chance , allowing david###adams' second inning grounder to roll through his legs . ... the mets said lhp jonathon niese will miss his turn sunday against miami because of shoulder tendinitis .
paris the united###states lost its vote at unesco on friday , two years after cutting off its financial###contribution to the organization over the admission of palestinians as full members . the move undermined america 's ability to exercise its influence in countries around the globe through the united###nations agency 's educational and aid###programs , according to western###diplomats and international###relations experts . under unesco 's constitution , any country that fails to pay###dues for two years loses its vote in the unesco general###assembly . the united###states ceased all support for the agency in , in response to a vote at unesco giving palestinians full membership . congress enacted###laws in the 1990s decreeing that the united###states stop providing money to any united###nations agency that accepts palestinians as full members . it was the first time that the united###states had voluntarily given up its vote in an organization it belongs to , diplomats here said . i deeply###regret this , irina###bokova , unesco 's director general , said in an interview friday at the agency 's headquarters here . this is not some kind of punishment on behalf of unesco for nonpayment . it 's just our rules . we 've###lost our biggest###contributor this has a bearing on all our programs , she said , adding that it was not just a matter of financing . she said the agency would miss the voice of the united###states on issues like freedom of expression and girls' education . ms . bokova , who has led the organization since , traveled to washington in 2011 to try to persuade american lawmakers to change the legislative language after the initial###funding cutoff . the obama administration tried to push through such a change last year , but failed . the american ambassador to unesco , david t . killion , speaking at the unesco general conference , now underway in paris , noted that the united###states had been involved in the united###nations educational , scientific###and###cultural###organization since its beginnings in 1945 and promised that it would remain involved . he praised unesco for its role in consensus and peace building , saying the agency was important for american work abroad . unesco is a critical partner in creating a better future , said mr . killion , adding that the obama administration was committed to getting funding restored so that the united###states could pay its dues and regain its position as a voting member . before withdrawing its financial###support , the united###states provided about 70 million , or 22 percent , of the agency 's annual###budget , and the suspension was felt almost immediately . some unesco staff members were laid off and programs and projects delayed , including some that potentially could have benefited the united###states . to make up the shortfall , ms . bokova created an emergency###fund and got contributions from saudi###arabia , qatar , norway and other countries . but she said she did not think that it would be possible to raise that money again this year . diplomats predicted subtle effects of the loss of america 's vote , as well as some obvious ones . for instance , it is less likely that two american sites on the list to become world###heritage###sites certified by unesco will win approval . one is an ancient###civilization site known as poverty###point , in northeastern###louisiana , and the other is a group of spanish###missions dating from the 18th century in san###antonio . the texas project was expected to create at least a thousand jobs , and both sites were expected to benefit from increased###tourism . more far reaching is the loss in the united###states' ability to exercise soft###power influence throughout the world , said esther brimmer , a former assistant###secretary###of###state###for###international###organization###affairs , who now teaches at george###washington###university . twenty years###ago the u.s . was the only one now there are other countries playing the soft###power game , said ms . brimmer , noting that the chinese deputy education minister had been elected head of unesco 's general conference . ms . bokova emphasized that the agency has given the united###states a platform to promote###democracy , education and human###rights in places that are often hostile to or suspicious of direct american involvement . with the united###states in a weakened position and unesco with less money , she said , some of that influence will diminish .
glendale , ariz . the phoenix###coyotes spent the past four years searching for impact players , but did n't have the money to land many due to the restraints of being run by the nhl . now that an owner is all but in place , the coyotes were able to make the kind of big###splash signing that should give them a big boost on and off the ice . landing one of the most coveted offensive players at the start of the free###agency period , the coyotes signed forward mike###ribeiro to a four year , 22 million contract on friday . since i came here six years###ago , we 've been searching for a playmaking center iceman , someone who could make his wingers better , coyotes general###manager don###maloney said . certainly , mike 's skill set , his ability to pass the puck , vision on the ice was an area we had ideally been looking for , so to be able to bring him to the desert is a really good day for us . the coyotes took a big###step toward stability this week when the glendale city###council approved an arena lease agreement with prospective owner renaissance sports and entertainment . headed by george gosbee , anthony leblanc and daryl jones , rse still needs to complete the lease agreement with glendale and its purchase of the coyotes ( by aug . 5 ) , but has already loosened the purse strings for the front office . in addition to ribeiro , the coyotes signed###free###agent goalie thomas###greiss to serve as a backup to mike###smith and re signed unrestricted###free###agent forward kyle chipchura to a multi year deal . they also signed multi year deals with forward lauri korpikoski and defensemen michael stone , both restricted free###agents , and signed defenseman chris summers to a one year deal . on top of that , phoenix was working on locking up a few more players within in the organization and still has the flexibility to sign or trade for others . it added up to a new free###agency experience for maloney and assistant gm brad treliving . what was interesting was that there was n't a pending free###agent in the marketplace that did n't call us and want to talk about coming to arizona to play hockey , maloney said . that 's the one thing i was really encouraged by . normally , brad and i are banging at the phones , 'will you please call us' ... and that gets a little old after a while , so this was such a totally different experience for brad and i . their big move was landing the kind of front line center they had been seeking almost since moving to the desert in . the 33 year old ribeiro has been a consistent scorer during his 14 year career , topping 50 points in a season eight times . he had 49 points , including 36 assists , in 48 games with washington last season . ribeiro played three seasons under coyotes coach dave###tippett in dallas and spent six seasons with montreal after the canadiens picked him in the second round of the 1998 nhl draft . he could play on the first line with captain shane###doan and mikkel boedker or could allow tippett to mix things up with his top lines . obviously , his relationship with dave###tippett was a huge factor in this decision , maloney said . they developed a very strong relationship when they were together in dallas and we 've monitored his status and feel like he has lots of life left in him . landing ribeiro was the biggest move , but locking up some of the team 's own players also was key , particularly since the team had struggled to do that in the past with the nhl running things . the 27 year old chipchura gave the coyotes toughness and skill on the fourth line , with five goals and nine assists last season . korpikoski , 26 , has developed into a solid playmaker on the left###wing , scoring 40 and 37 points the previous two seasons before dropping to 11 during the lockout###shortened 2012 13 season while battling injuries . the 23 year old stone spent most of the 2011 12 season in the ahl , but developed into one of phoenix 's best defensemen the last half of the 2012 13 season , finishing with five goals and four assists . the coyotes also are hoping to re sign boedker , a restricted###free###agent . the coyotes were n't able to retain forward boyd###gordon , one of their top offseason priorities , when he signed a three year deal with edmonton . backup goalie jason###labarbera also signed with the oilers . boyd was a great player for us and i 'm happy for him to get his contract , maloney said . that 's the business and they ( the oilers ) certainly value him and had enough in their payroll budget that they could spend what they wanted to spend . we liked boyd with us , we would have liked to keep him , it just got to a point where we decided we 're going to have to go another direction . losing gordon was tough , but unlike###previous###seasons when key players left , the coyotes have the support from an owner to get someone else to take his place .
atlanta the mets wrestled with themselves all afternoon sunday . wild###pitches , misplayed balls , bad swings and walks ruined them . the team that looked spectacularly poised friday###night in a dramatic victory over atlanta lost to the braves , 9 4 , at turner###field . the mets were 2 3 on their swing through miami and atlanta and were as up and down as the spring thermometer and as disjointed as the weekend 's weather , which rained out their game against the braves on saturday . the mets are , and it is still not settled whether they can be a decent team . it seems like we play good baseball minnesota we played good baseball but we get some weather and it breaks the momentum a little bit , third baseman david###wright said . the same thing here . we have one of the better wins this year and the weather breaks up the momentum again . we have to find a way to regain that momentum . starting###pitcher jon###niese ( 2 3 ) walked six and gave up seven runs in four innings . he was pitching with an extra day of rest because of saturday 's rainout , and manager terry###collins wanted to offer the rest as an alibi . niese would accept no excuses . i do n't know about that , niese said when told collins thought the walks were because niese was too strong . today is one of those outings i just want to forget about , niese said . i walked way too many guys . it 's embarrassing . niese was embarrassed , but he was not alone . in the decisive third inning , the braves took a 1 0 lead and had runners on first and second when freddie###freeman hit a long fly to left###field . the mets' left###fielder , lucas###duda , took one step in but quickly spun around when he realized the ball was going over his head . it landed at the base of the fence , allowing both runners to score . the backdrop is kind of white it 's tough to get a read off the ball , duda said , explaining a familiar problem for outfielders in day games at turner###field . i just got beat . after evan###gattis grounded out , moving freeman to third , catcher john###buck then let a pitch to dan###uggla get through his legs to the backstop . freeman scored to make it , and uggla walked . b . j . upton then smashed a ball to the right of wright at third base . wright , a two time gold###glove winner , could not handle the ball , putting runners on first and second . we did n't###play great defense by any means , but they were finding a bunch of holes , wright said . collins said it was one of those days where we had a bad inning . you ca n't let those guys get too far ahead of you . the mets , meanwhile , struggled with atlanta starter tim###hudson ( 4 1 ) and his assortment of sinkers , fastballs and curveballs . wright hit his fifth home###run of the season in the fourth to make it , but hudson pitched into the eighth###inning by striking out seven and walking just one . he slowed us down , sped us up , right fielder marlon###byrd said . as haphazard as they were , the mets still had life in the top of the eighth . trailing by , they loaded the bases for byrd with two outs . he faced braves reliever eric o'flaherty two days after scorching a game tying home###run off him in the eighth###inning of friday###night 's 7 5 win . on a 3 2 pitch , the left handed o'flaherty threw a pitch that ended up just above byrd 's shoe tops . byrd swung and missed to end the threat . it was a sinker , byrd said . i swung and missed it . the mets will hand the ball to their best pitcher , matt###harvey , for tuesday 's game against the white###sox at citi###field , hoping finally to gather some momentum . what happened to niese on sunday with extra rest has collins a little anxious about what might happen with harvey , 1 . 56 earned###run###average , whose routine has likewise been altered . yeah , that 's why he threw today , collins said when he was asked if was worried about harvey . harvey threw in the bullpen sunday , something niese did not do before his delayed###start sunday . what you 're seeing is the result of a guy who had too much rest , collins said of niese .
ryan###braun is not especially important to the baseball world anymore , except to those people who work or root for the milwaukee###brewers . as a national figure , braun is all but ruined . most people will place him off in a corner of their minds in a jail###cell with giant syringes for bars , let 's say with all the other drug cheats . but for the brewers and their fans , braun is theirs to stay , signed with the team through . he got a standing###ovation at miller###park in his first at bat after agreeing to a 105 million###contract###extension in . later that season , he used performance###enhancing###drugs , braun admitted in a statement thursday . in an interview last month , a week or so after braun accepted a 65 game suspension from major###league###baseball , the brewers owner mark attanasio said he was deeply###hurt by his star 's betrayal . but he also said there seemed to be enough good in braun that he was worth trying to redeem . taking his punishment was better than continuing to lie . it 's a step in the right direction , attanasio said . but it 's one step . he 's got a lot of steps he needs to take . in that spirit , give braun or , at least , his handlers credit for his 944 word apology on thursday . it was a step . it was incomplete , to be sure , and it would have been more courageous to deliver the statement in person and take questions . but it was a step . i have no one to blame but myself , braun 's statement said . i know that over the last year and a half i made some serious mistakes , both in the information i failed to share during my arbitration hearing and the comments i made to the press afterwards . i have disappointed the people closest to me the ones who fought for me because they truly believed me all along . i kept the truth from everyone . for a long time , i was in denial and convinced myself that i had not done anything wrong . braun who said he had been self righteous and filled with unjustified anger went on to apologize to relatives , teammates , the brewers organization , friends , agents and advisers . that covers just about everyone , but braun cited four others by name commissioner bud###selig and a top lieutenant , rob###manfred the union leader michael weiner and dino laurenzi jr . , the urine sample collector whose reputation braun tried to smear after winning the appeal of his positive drug###test on a technicality in . braun said then that he would bet his life that no banned###substance had ever entered his body . he strongly###implied that his sample had been tampered with , and an espn report last weekend said he lobbied for support from other players by telling them laurenzi was an anti###semitic cubs fan . ( braun is jewish . ) on thursday , braun 's statement blamed nobody else . here is what happened , it said . during the latter part of the 2011 season , i was dealing with a nagging injury and i turned to products for a short period of time that i should n't have used . the products were a cream and a lozenge , which i was told could help expedite my rehabilitation . it was a huge mistake for which i am deeply ashamed , and i compounded the situation by not admitting my mistakes immediately . someday , braun will be in the same setting as reporters , who will challenge him on his version of events . did he know he was cheating ? how could he have been so stupid , either to knowingly cheat or to fail to research the products he took ? just what were those products , anyway ? on and on and on . it would be helpful to hear braun answer such questions . he did , after all , stage that infamous news conference when he won his appeal , so for the sake of symmetry , he ought to hold another . but he is under no obligation to do so , and he may choose to let the long statement speak for itself , rather than risk being caught in more lies . however he handles the news###media , braun must appeal directly to fans . he began that process , in a way , with a separate statement in an e mail to brewers fans on thursday . i understand i have abused your trust , that statement said , adding that braun faced a lengthy###process to prove myself to you again . that process should include meeting with season###ticket###holders when the suspension is over , to answer their questions directly . braun should show up for community events , wherever and whenever the brewers ask . he chose to commit his career to milwaukee , and he should hear , firsthand , what the city has to tell him . braun has already met with his teammates , many of whom had believed him and , like attanasio , felt###betrayed . returning to the field , facing opponents skeptical of his character and doubtful of his story , will be another challenge . this twitter message thursday###night from brett###anderson , an oakland###athletics pitcher , probably summed up a lot of players' feelings so braun has spent the last month writing an apology statement novel ... anderson , like most in baseball , can afford to think that way , because braun is tangential to his place in the game . what matters most now is braun 's relationship with the brewers and their fans . his statement nudged him along , if only a bit , on a path he hopes will lead to acceptance .
( reuters ) fred###couples opted for a blend of experience and emerging###talent while nick###price banked on current###form when they announced their captain 's picks on wednesday for next month 's presidents###cup in dublin , ohio . couples chose former major winner webb###simpson and rookie sensation jordan###spieth as his wild###cards for the u.s . team . price went for fellow zimbabwean brendon de jonge and australian marc###leishman to round out his 12 man international lineup . spieth , leishman and de jonge will be making their first appearances in the biennial team###competition while simpson is set for his second stint with the u.s . after making his cup debut in australia in . simpson , the 2012 u.s . open###champion , was widely###expected to be included for the ryder###cup style competition after spending most of the past two years in the automatic top 10 in the u.s . points###standings before finishing up in 11th . red###hot pga###tour###rookie spieth was a much bolder selection but had captured couples' attention with a sizzling run of form over the past two months . the 20 year old won his maiden pga###tour title at the john###deere###classic in july , lost out in a playoff for last month 's wyndham###championship and rocketed into a tie for fourth at the deutsche###bank###championship on monday after closing with a . to pick jordan was the right move and he is having an incredible year , couples said after announcing his two picks on golf###channel . he is one of our top players , even though he is only . i 'm excited to have a young kid on the team . i left keegan ( bradley ) out two years###ago , and that was a killer decision . he has become one of the best young###players in the game . it 's a team game , and everybody i talked to on the team wanted spieth . he definitely deserves it . couples said he had always planned to pick simpson , though he was bitterly###disappointed to have no room on his team for jim###furyk , a veteran of seven presidents cups . i have n't talked to him ( furyk ) yet , couples added . i told him last night that he was n't on the team through a text and would talk to him today just because i just could n't###handle it , to be honest with you . the two guys that i wanted dearly to be on the team were steve###stricker and jim###furyk ... that 's not to say that i did n't want any of the other 10 guys . i took the easy way out . jordan deserves to be on the team and webb is a class###act . burly zimbabwean de jonge , though yet to win on the pga###tour , has established a reputation as a 'birdie machine' on the u.s . circuit and gained price 's nod after a consistent 2013 campaign capped by a strong start to the fedexcup playoffs . leishman , whose only pga###tour victory came at the 2012 travelers###championship , has recorded four top 10s this season and effectively sealed his cup debut by finishing 16th at the deutsche###bank###championship . the biggest headache for price was having to leave out south african tim###clark , a relatively short but accurate hitter off the tee who is known for his matchplay prowess and has played in three presidents cups . yesterday was probably one of the toughest days of my life , said price . i had it down to three guys marc , brendon and tim###clark . to try and separate the three of them and only pick two was an exceptionally difficult###task . you had experience on one hand with tim , and then you had youth in the two rookies in marc and brendon . when push came to shove , it came down to who i felt is going to play muirfield the best . muirfield village is a specialist golf course and both marc and brendon cut the ball and fade the ball , and they hit the ball pretty far . the u.s . have dominated the presidents###cup , winning seven times in nine editions , including a 19 15 victory in the most recent edition at royal melbourne in australia two years###ago . the only success for the internationals came in 1998 when the event was first staged in melbourne . in , the two teams battled to a 17 17 draw in south###africa .
mark###sanford 's fianc e , the argentine for whom he risked a political career , stood next to him tuesday as he accepted the republican nomination for a south###carolina congressional seat . mar a bel n chapur 's appearance was a surprise , especially to leaders in the national###republican###party . it might not have been the most strategic move in mr . sanford 's attempt at a political comeback . still , it was how mr . sanford wanted it . whether national republican leaders will decide that the former governor is putting the seat in jeopardy and decide to lend more support is only one question in a race that has already been filled with political and personal drama . after defeating 15 other candidates in a primary###race and winning a runoff on tuesday , mr . sanford faces elizabeth colbert busch , a democrat with enough celebrity appeal and financial###backing to change what could have been an easy###victory in the special###election on may 7 into a real battle . everybody is really concerned because she 's not a bad looking lady , she is a good speaker and she 's got some money , said jerry hallman , chairman of the beaufort###county republican###party . in politics , those things are important . the seat became vacant after senator jim###demint announced in december that he was stepping down to take over the heritage###foundation . gov . nikki r . haley appointed representative tim###scott to replace him , opening up the congressional seat that mr . sanford held before he became governor . gender , fidelity and experience are already shaping up as themes in the district , which includes charleston , hilton###head and some low country farmland . mr . sanford began his campaign as a kind of apology tour , explaining he had learned much about humility after leaving the governor 's office in , having lied about a trip to argentina to visit ms . chapur . mr . sanford said he was hiking the appalachian###trail . although he finished his term , he faced ethics fines , censure by his party and divorce from his wife of 21 years , jenny . now , he has gone on the offensive , portraying himself as a seasoned fiscal hawk in a race against a political neophyte whose most notable credential is her celebrity family . ms . colbert busch 's younger###brother is the comedian stephen###colbert , who has been active in her campaign . already the national###republican###party , though not committing to using heavy###artillery in the race , is painting ms . colbert busch as too liberal for a district that voted for mitt###romney in the presidential###primary . ( newt###gingrich won the state over all . ) so far , elizabeth colbert busch has yet to answer any real questions about why she supports president###obama 's failed policies , said katie prill , a spokeswoman for the national###republican###congressional###committee . she might be the gem of the beltway and hollywood liberals , but south carolinians are going to be sorely disappointed the more they learn about her . ms . colbert busch is leaning on her years as a maritime executive and at clemson###university , where she is leading an effort to develop the state 's wind###power industry . she is also relying on several women in congress , among them senator kirsten e . gillibrand , the new york democrat , who began using twitter to seek donations to the campaign . democratic leaders realize the race must be run without error , with special attention paid to women and moderate###republicans who remember mr . sanford 's rocky relationship with the legislature when he was in office and , of course , his affair . but the national###organization probably wo n't make a move until the other side does . this is a republican seat in a republican district , so we 'll###wait and see what the republicans do , said jesse###ferguson of the democratic###congressional###campaign###committee . hesaid national republican organization might not be eager to get involved . having mark###sanford as the face of the party is probably not the best thing for a party trying to rehabilitate itself with women###voters , he said .
new york eric###young made a diving catch to take a go ahead hit away from todd###helton in the sixth###inning , then raced home with the tiebreaking run in the eighth , and the new york mets beat the colorado###rockies 3 2 on tuesday###night . the rockies have lost 12 of 18 since the all star break and have scored five runs in their last three games . latroy###hawkins gave up a pair of two out singles in the ninth before ike###davis made a diving catch on yorvit###torrealba 's sinking liner foul down the first base###line . it was hawkins first save since may , 2012 , for the angels . eric###young led off the eighth with a single against wilton lopez . he was able to take second on marlon###byrd 's deep fly , putting him in position to make it home on juan lagares' infield single , a slow chopper to second base , that he just barely beat out . young sped up as he rounded third and beat the throw home . lagares also hit a two run triple in the first inning . mets starter jenrry mejia tied a season high with seven strikeouts , but left after 5 1 3 innings . he allowed a tying solo homer to pinch###hitter chris blackmon to lead off the sixth and nearly gave up the lead , too , after a long###pause in the game when plate ump manny gonzalez was injured . the umpire appeared to be hit in the jaw after a pitch from mejia bounced up and hit him in the throat . gonzalez was escorted off under his own power , but second base###umpire larry vanover had to go change into protective###gear to assume duties behind the plate . mejia only got one out after the interlude , though third baseman wilmer flores committed an error on a tough hop off the bat of troy tulowitzki and michael###cuddyer walked . carlos###torres came on with the bases###loaded and retired wilin rosario on a pop fly to center too shallow to score a run before young made his diving grab on helton 's liner . flores was making his big###league debut . he mostly played###shortstop in the mets system , but filled in at third because david###wright was hurt last weekend . chad bettis , who made the start while tyler chatwood got pushed back a few days to let his tweaked hamstring rest , allowed two runs and four hits in five innings . lagares hit a two out , two run triple in the first inning to put the mets up . bettis settled down after that , and the rockies got a run back for him in the fifth , when rosario hit a leadoff###single and scored on a sacrifice###fly . davis lifted his glove over helton 's grounder to first base for an error , allowing rosario to take third with nobody out . after he scored , d.j . lemahieu hit into an inning ending double###play . notes mets rhp matt###harvey ( 8 3 ) is expected to face rockies rhp jhoulys chacin ( 10 5 ) in wednesday 's game . ... rockies of corey dickerson has hit###safely in six straight###games . ... mets lhp jonathon niese struck out six and allowed two runs and four hits in five innings of a rehab start at double a binghamton . ... lagares has 12 rbis since the all star break .

( you ) ca n't really afford a bad nine holes when you win , simpson said . i think it 's just me continuing to keep playing well , and hopefully i 'm in that position on sunday where i do have a chance to win . the last two greenbrier classics have gone to playoffs , and stuart###appleby needed a birdie on the final hole for a 59 to beat jeff###overton by a stroke in the inaugural tournament in . mickelson is coming off top five finishes in three of his last four tournaments . but he has yet to shoot an under par round at the greenbrier , missing the cut each of the past two years . last year marked the first time that mickelson and tiger###woods missed the cut in a tournament as professionals . woods is n't entered this year . he has a sore left elbow and is n't playing again until the british###open . among others in the field are jordan###spieth , the 19 year old texan in search of an elusive win that would give him his pga###tour membership and make him eligible for the fedex###cup###playoffs . he finished###sixth at the at t national . he 's won more than . 1 million this year and is assured of a tour card when the new season starts in october .

los###angeles kerry###washington starts with the shoes . to portray olivia###pope , the tough crisis manager at the center of the hit abc series scandal , ms . washington is always in gravity###defying heels . how else to make that sexed up power stalk down the white###house corridors ? i never completely understand a character until i know what kind of shoes they wear , ms . washington said . for an interview at milk studios here , she was in a pair of intimidating white high###heels . but ms . washington is often in sneakers or flip###flops , a clue for anyone trying to understand her . it says i 'm not really attracted to walking in the world in any one way , she explained . i like to walk in the world a lot of different ways . those ways have ranged from the role of the slave broomhilda in quentin###tarantino 's recent django###unchained to the pampered grace peeples in the modern romantic###comedy peeples , out on may . but it has been through the intimacy and reach of television that ms . washington , 36 , has arrived in the center of a major cultural discussion . thanks to scandal , she is only the second black woman in almost 40 years to lead a network television drama , and the first one to make it a bona###fide hit . ratings for the political###thriller , which began last april , have been building all season it now beats its rival at 10 p.m . on thursday elementary on cbs many weeks among viewers 18 to , the demographic advertisers covet most . critics hail its often outrageous , fast###paced plot###twists . the designer dressed pope , who has her own crisis###management firm , and her team of young gladiators in suits repair reputations and fix scandals , from kidnappings to murder . pope is also the former mistress of president fitzgerald grant , or fitz , a white married republican played by tony###goldwyn their sex scenes sizzled . 'scandal' has flair and even sophistication , the critic alessandra###stanley wrote in the times . in no small part that is because of ms . washington 's ability to convey class and sensuality at the same time , in the words of reginald###hudlin , a producer of django###unchained . for many devotees , the show 's depiction of a complex black woman at the top of her game her racial###identity never a big###deal is the cherry on top . paradoxically , attention to the breakout role has meant ms . washington must###carry the racial aspirations and fantasies of more than a few fans as well as the expectation that her success could open###doors in the notoriously race averse world of network television . it 's clear that scandal has touched a nerve twitter regularly blows up with scandal related tweets when the show is on , and the flood of cyberspace chatter has included debates about the interracial sex , the politics and the clothes . ms . washington 's remark this year that she would have turned down the role had the president been black ( out of concern that such a character might reflect an insider 's view of mr . obama , whose administration she volunteers for ) drew###attention , too . we 're putting a lot of our hopes on kerry 's shoulders , said yaba blay , an assistant###professor of africana###studies at drexel###university , who live tweets about the show with a group of female academics . the conversations about her go beyond the role , to the idea of representing us well as middle###class and upper###middle###class , educated###women , mostly because of the scarcity of such images of black women . we are the same women the media has said are not attractive , are not marriageable , she added . if that sounds like pressure , ms . washington , who comes across as thoughtful , brainy and down to earth in an interview , said she had never felt undue responsibility for presenting a certain brand of black womanhood . in her view , she said , it 's more a matter of hollywood executives catching up with a changing###world . a phi###beta###kappa graduate of george###washington###university , where she designed an interdisciplinary major that covered theater , anthropology and sociology , ms . washington clearly knows the stakes i wanted 'scandal' to be a success because i wanted networks and studios to believe that people of color and that women can be the driving###force both separately and when you happen to have both . i feel###proud that we live in a world where 'scandal' can succeed . it was n't up to me . the variable was the audience was the audience going to be ready ? with ms . washington in scandal and a black man in the real oval###office , it seems a long time ago that teresa###graves was the first black woman to star in a network drama . she played an undercover###cop in get christie love ! on abc in , which was canceled after one season . it drew###attention as a barrier breaker but never achieved high###ratings . ms . graves eventually###abandoned acting and died in . diahann###carroll , who worked with ms . washington in peeples , appearing briefly as grace 's grandmother , recalled the pains and joys of being a pathbreaker she played the title role in the 1968 71 comedy###series julia , about a widowed nurse raising her son . but she suggested that ms . washington had no real burden to bear . this is work , ms . carroll said . it 's not fair to ask us to do anything else .

london west###ham united fretted over how to stop liverpool 's luis suarez from running###wild on saturday after the uruguayan banged in four goals against norwich###city in midweek . the hammers have not won at anfield since 1963 and suarez , the league 's top scorer with 13 goals in nine appearances since he came back from a 10 match###suspension for biting chelsea defender branislav ivanovic , will fancy his chances of increasing his tally . manager sam###allardyce said starving suarez of the ball would be the priority . if you ca n't###control luis suarez , on what you saw the other night against norwich , it 's certainly going to be one where he is rattling the goals in , he told the club website ( www . whufc . com ) on friday . when you go there on the back of the four goals he scored in a 5 1 win , it makes life even more difficult , but we have to take up the challenge to try to nullify his great###talent . allardyce , whose side are 17th and three points off the drop###zone , travel###north after losing 1 0 to struggling crystal###palace on tuesday . they have midfielder ravel###morrison suspended , after the youngster picked up his fifth booking of the season , while record signing and former liverpool frontman andy###carroll has resumed###training but is still some way off a return . like everything else , we 'll get him back as quick as we possibly can , but my position is to take a sensible view , said allardyce . we 're in a difficult###position at the minute but i ca n't panic into putting andy in too quickly . it 's my responsibility to make sure he is there to stay when he comes back onto the field , and not just one or two games . in the position we 're in at the moment , it 's extremely###tough to resist putting him in . i 'd like to put him on the bench at liverpool , but that would be rather stupid .
milwaukee jeremy hefner was never hyped and hardly ballyhooed . for him , success and job###security as a ballplayer were not guaranteed . some prospects can subsist on large signing bonuses and seem pampered as they are shepherded toward their big###league clubs . hefner worked as a walmart cashier for two winters before making his first ascent to the majors . the odds against him placed a small chip on his shoulder and a strong work ethic into his core . after the mets claimed hefner off waivers following the 2011 season , he fashioned himself into a pliable company man , doing everything the organization asked , no complaints . now he has begun to do much more . hefner produced yet another superb outing sunday###afternoon to lead the mets past the milwaukee###brewers , 2 1 , and extend his midseason revival . hefner lost his first five decisions this year and watched his team go 1 11 through his first 14 starts . but since june , he has had an impressive turnaround , compiling a . 27 earned###run###average , only once allowing more than two runs during the seven start stretch . we 're talking about a guy that was coming into spring###training as the sixth guy , manager terry###collins said . now , collins said , he 's a legitimate guy in this rotation . earlier this year , when the mets were preparing to promote the heralded prospect zack wheeler from class###aaa las###vegas , hefner 's name came up time and again as someone who could lose his job . amid the chatter , he said he was just trying to survive . i was maybe one or two bad starts from being in las###vegas , he said . something had to change . hefner spent several years as a san###diego###padres farmhand before the organization let him go , an experience that humbled and focused him . he has doubled down on the focus this year . over the past weeks , he adjusted his delivery , adding a pronounced twist to his windup . the change was meant to add deception to his motion , but it also unexpectedly increased his velocity . i just tried to give it my all , and my best , and if it was n't good enough , then i 'm a triple a pitcher , hefner said about his growth . it was a challenge for me , and i embraced it . the end###product was clear again at miller###park . hefner allowed two hits and one walk , and he struck out eight , tying his career###high . hefner 's first and only real mistake did not come until the seventh###inning , when he left an 0 2 fastball over the plate to jonathan###lucroy , who crushed it over the center###field###fence for a solo home###run . hefner hung his head and stamped his foot on the mound , but he quickly bounced back , getting the next three outs to finish his day on a strong note . his sharpness made up for the mets' subdued performance at the plate . josh satin returned to the lineup and provided enough spark , extending his hitting###streak to 11 games and his on base streak to . satin was relegated to the bench friday when ike###davis returned to reclaim his spot at first base , but collins said it would only be fair , given how well satin was playing , to find him some playing time . and satin strengthened his case . after singling to start the second inning , he lined a two out double to center to start a fourth###inning rally . he came around to score that inning when third baseman juan###francisco fielded andrew###brown 's grounder and misfired on his throw across the diamond . sometimes , when you do n't###play for a few days , you 're kind of curious how it 's going to go the first at bat , said satin , who can play the corner infield###positions and second base and has worked out lately as an outfielder . after i got a hit the first at bat , i was like 'all right , i 'm fine . it 's the same . ' two innings later , satin was at it again , hitting another double , this one off the right field wall , to drive in marlon###byrd from second and increase the mets' lead to . both runs against the left hander tom###gorzelanny were unearned , as the brewers , continuing a season long trend , played horrendous defense behind him . the mets squandered chances , getting 11 hits but leaving nine runners on base . but the modest output proved sufficient largely because of hefner , whose stature continues to grow . the right hander shaun###marcum was scheduled to fly to st . louis on sunday###night to have additional###tests for a vexing injury issue . marcum again felt numbness and tingling around his pitching hand during his start saturday###night . he had a magnetic###resonance###imaging test last week that revealed no structural###damage . he began the year on the disabled###list after having nerve inflammation around his neck and shoulder . terry###collins said the mets would consider skipping marcum 's final rotation turn before the all star break to give him some additional rest .

new york australian pitcher grant###balfour was on his best behavior during tuesday 's all star game at citi###field , keeping his temper and opposing###batters under control as he helped the american###league team to a 3 0 win . balfour has developed a cult following among oakland a 's fans because of his tempestuous antics on the mound which have become known as as the 'balfour rage' . however , the 35 year old australian kept his cool on tuesday with a brief but polished performance in the annual match up between the best players in major###league###baseball . it was a great experience , he told###reporters . i just tried to settle myself down and enjoy it all and i thought i did a pretty good job . balfour became only the second australian to play in the all star game , joining former milwaukee###brewers catcher dave###nilsson , who was picked for the 1999 midsummer classic . balfour was a late inclusion for the team after his oakland team###mate bartolo colon withdrew , although many thought the australian should have been an original selection . although he struggled through the early###stages of his career , balfour is currently in the form of his life after being given the role of closer with the athletics . since april last year , balfour has completed 43 consecutive saves , including 25 this season . he broke the previous oakland franchise###record , held by hall of famer dennis###eckersley , and has played a major part in taking the a 's to the top of the al west standings . playing in the all star games was one of my goals , now i want to win a world###series , he said . balfour pitched just one inning on tuesday , the sixth , but did enough to show he was not out a place in a roster that included mariano###rivera and justin###verlander . after walking michael###cuddyer , he got bryce###harper to pop out to shortstop and matt carpenter to fly out to center . then balfour struck out andrew###mccutchen , his eighth strike from his 15 pitches , to end the inning .
berlin former germany international horst###hrubesch has been reappointed as coach of germany 's under 21 team after their early exit at the european###championship this month , the german###football###association ( dfb ) said on friday . hrubesch , who replaces rainer adrion , coached the under 21 team to the european title in 2009 before taking over the under 18 team . tournament###favourites germany went out of the european under 21 championship in israel with two consecutive###defeats while germany 's under 19 and under 17 teams failed to even qualify for their european championships . coaching the new under 21 team is a very interesting job with spectacular events like the european###championship in 2015 and the 2016 rio de janeiro olympics coming up , hrubesch , who as a player led germany to the 1980 european title , told###reporters . i did not hesitate to agree when ( dfb general secretary ) helmut sandrock asked me yesterday to do it . the dfb said the decision was taken after consultation with germany coach joachim loew , who had poached several under 21 players just before the tournament for a national###team tour of the united###states .
london jose mourinho 's jigsaw pieces are slowly falling into place and if the chelsea 'messiah' can tempt manchester united to part with their prodigal###son wayne###rooney the final part of the puzzle will be complete . mourinho , who said he had gone from being the 'special one' to the 'happy one' when he returned in june for a second spell as coach at his spiritual stamford###bridge home following spells at inter###milan and real###madrid , has made no secret of his desire to sign the england striker . rooney also seems keen to end his nine year spell at manchester united for a move to chelsea but can united afford to allow their prize asset to reinforce the title claims of one of their leading premier###league rivals ? mourinho has already had two sizeable bids for rooney rejected and former united and england captain bryan###robson believes he will need to wave a huge financial carrot in front of the old trafford hierarchy in order to seal the deal . the thing that makes me laugh is i 've been told it ( the latest offer ) is 25 million###pounds to 30 million###pounds , robson told talksport radio . for wayne###rooney ? a 27 year old who is probably in the top six strikers in the world ? what are united going to have to pay to replace him ? i 'm amazed at that it 's an insult to wayne###rooney . insult or not , mourinho is prepared to play a waiting game , content in the knowledge he can already call upon three good strikers in fernando###torres , romelu###lukaku and demba###ba . torres has often flattered to deceive since joining chelsea for a record fee of 50 million###pounds from liverpool two and a half years###ago although he showed signs of improvement last season . the spain striker bagged 23 goals in all competitions including a dazzling run from the halfway line to score the equaliser in the 2 1 europa###league final###victory over benfica in amsterdam in may . mourinho believes torres , who is at his best when balls are played beyond the opposition defence for him to use his pace , is capable of flourishing if his team###mates utilise his strengths . when we see torres with his back to goal surrounded by two or three opponents we know he is not going to produce a piece of magic , said the coach who led chelsea to back to back premier###league titles in 2005 and . but this is torres . we want the team not to learn how to play with him but to improve how to play with him , said mourinho who is adored by the chelsea fans and will get a special welcome at his first game back at home to hull###city on sunday . it is impossible to re model his game but we want to adapt the team and teach the team how to use his best qualities . he is what he is and he is very good with the qualities he has got so we need to learn and support his game . chelsea , who finished third in the premier###league under interim###coach rafael benitez last season , have been boosted by the signing of germany forward andre schuerrle from bayer###leverkusen . mourinho also swooped for young dutch international midfielder marco van###ginkel in the close season while midfielder michael###essien , winger kevin de bruyne and utility###player nathaniel chalobah have returned after loan###spells elsewhere . it is the return of the charismatic portuguese coach , however , that has attracted so much attention to 2012 european###champions chelsea . the premier###league requires a jose mourinho character more than ever , said former united and england defender gary###neville . he is the biggest signing of the summer for english football . you ca n't###ignore him , the way he challenges people , works the media or celebrates on the touchline like a fan . whoever you support you should be delighted to have jose mourinho back for the new season .

awaiting a supreme###court ruling the new york times asked###readers how supreme###court###decisions on gay###marriage might affect them . for hampton and michael catlin , a binational couple , the ruling could determine where they live . washington within days , the supreme###court is expected to issue a series of decisions that could transform three fundamental###social institutions marriage , education and voting . the extraordinary run of blockbuster rulings due in the space of a single week will also reshape the meaning of legal###equality and help define for decades to come one of the constitution 's grandest commands the equal###protection of the laws . if those words require only equal treatment from the government , the rulings are likely to be a mixed###bag that will delight and disappoint liberals and conservatives in equal###measure . under that approach , same sex couples who want to marry would be better off at the end of the term , while blacks and hispanics could find it harder to get into college and to vote . but a tension runs through the cases , one based on different conceptions of equality . some justices are committed to formal equality . others say the constitution requires a more dynamic kind of equality , one that takes account of the weight of history and of modern disparities . the four major cases yet to be decided concern same###sex###marriage , affirmative###action in higher###education and the fate of the voting###rights###act of , which places special burdens on states with a history of racial###discrimination . formal equality would require that gay couples be treated just like straight couples when it comes to marriage , white students just like black students when it comes to admissions decisions and southern states just like northern ones when it comes to federal###oversight of voting . the effect would be to help gay couples , and hurt blacks and latinos . but such rulings liberal when it comes to gay###rights , conservative when it comes to race are hard to reconcile with the historical meaning of the 14th amendment 's equal###protection###clause , adopted in the wake of the civil###war and meant to protect the newly###freed black slaves . it would be odd , said david a . strauss , a law professor at the university of chicago , for that amendment to help gays but not blacks . what 's weird about it would be the retreat on race , which is the paradigm example of what the 14th amendment is meant to deal with , he said , coupled with fairly aggressive action on sexual###orientation . but actual as opposed to formal racial###equality has fallen out of favor in some circles , professor strauss said . one thing that seems to be going on with these historically excluded groups , he said , is that they come to be thought of as just another interest group . blacks seem to have crossed that line . justice antonin###scalia appeared to express that view during the argument in february in the voting rights case , shelby###county v . holder , no . 12 96 . whenever a society adopts racial entitlements , he said , it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes . gay men and lesbians have yet to achieve formal###legal equality . they are not protected against job###discrimination in much of the nation , may not marry their same sex###partners in most of it and do not have their marriages recognized by the federal###government in any of it . the fact that they are asking for equal treatment may help their cause in the cases challenging the federal defense###of###marriage###act , or doma , which for purposes of federal benefits defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman , and proposition , the california voter initiative that banned###same###sex###marriage there . but chief###justice john g . roberts jr . suggested in march that ordinary politics would sort things out . as far as i can tell , he told a lawyer challenging the federal marriage law in united###states v . windsor , no . 12 307 , political###figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case . in the three months since that argument , three more states have adopted same###sex###marriage , raising the total to , along with the district of columbia . kenji yoshino , a law professor at new york###university , said the two different conceptions of equal###protection are animated by different concerns . one is skeptical of government classifications based on race and similar###characteristics , whatever their goals . the other tries to make sure that historically disfavored groups are not subordinated . under jim###crow , professor yoshino said , both horses ran in the same direction . southern states enacted###laws that drew formal distinctions , and those distinctions oppressed blacks . these days , professor yoshino said , the two horses are running in opposite###directions . consider the case of abigail fisher , a white woman who was denied###admission to the university of texas . she says the university , an arm of the state government , should not classify people on the basis of race because that violates a colorblind conception of the constitution 's equal###protection###clause . defenders of the university 's affirmative###action program say the purpose of the classification must figure in the equal###protection analysis . what we 're really trying to do is try to make sure there are n't castes in our society , and we will try to lift up castes , professor yoshino said . a formal conception of equality helps ms . fisher in her case , fisher v . university of texas , no . 11 345 . a dynamic one helps the university . whichever side loses a major supreme###court###case is likely to say the decision was an example of judicial###activism . that term can be an empty insult , but political###scientists try to give it meaning . they say a court is activist when it strikes down a law as unconstitutional . there is a chance the court will be activist in that sense twice this week . it may strike down central provisions of the federal marriage law and of the voting###rights###act . should that happen , said pamela harris , an adviser to the supreme###court institute at georgetown 's law###school , the left will be saying out of one side of its mouth , 'how dare you strike down the considered judgment of congress in the voting###rights###act ? ' in the same breath , she said , liberals will add , but great job on doma . there is another possibility one or more of the cases could fizzle , said walter e . dellinger , who served as acting solicitor###general in the clinton###administration and filed an influential brief in the proposition 8 case , hollingsworth v . perry , no . 12 144 . it argued that the failure of officials in california to appeal the judgment against them deprived the supreme###court of jurisdiction to decide the case , and it was discussed at the argument in march . mr . dellinger said all four remaining blockbuster cases suffer from plausible procedural flaws that could lead to their dismissal . i 've###never###heard of this before , he said of such an end of term possibility . an effort to harmonize all of the court 's big decisions may in the end prove impossible . it 's hard to imagine somebody happy with everything they do , except justice###kennedy , professor strauss said , referring to the member of the court at its ideological center , justice anthony m . kennedy . that may be just as well for the court 's reputation . in giving something to liberals and something to conservatives , as it often does , professor strauss said , the court has avoided putting itself in a position where either side wants to declare war on them .
new york the centre court at arthur###ashe###stadium , the main###venue for the u.s . open , and a rebuilt louis###armstrong arena are to have retractable roofs installed , the united###states###tennis###association ( usta ) said on thursday . the move will bring the u.s . open into line with wimbledon and the australian###open which both have retractable roofs on their centre courts . the french###open has announced###plans to cover its main court . two new stadiums will be also be added as part of a 550 million overhaul of the billie###jean###king###national###tennis###center in flushing###meadows , new york , a project which should be completed by . in order to have spectacular facilities we want to make sure we have the excitement and the energy that new york deserves and the world comes to see , dave haggerty , the usta 's chairman of the board , said at a news conference . our strategic mission , when completed , will have a couple of new stadiums , a better fan experience , we will have wider walkways so that people can get around and , yes , as you have heard , there will be a roof on arthur###ashe###stadium . in addition louis###armstrong ( stadium ) will have a roof as well . the arthur###ashe###stadium roof , teflon coated and translucent in appearance , will measure , 000 square###feet and organizers hope to have it installed at the earliest for the 2016 u.s . open and most likely by the 2017 u.s . open . a new , 000 seat grandstand stadium court will be constructed in time for 2015 followed by a , 000 seat louis###armstrong stadium court to be opened before the 2018 edition . we recognize there are many known , and certainly many unknown , hurdles we will have to confront to meet this schedule , said usta executive###director gordon###smith . we are ready for the challenge and hope we can achieve it . andy###murray , the u.s . open###champion who is competing this week at the western and southern open in cincinnati , welcomed the news . for tv and stuff it 's fantastic , he told###reporters . always good that you know matches are going to get finished ... rain delays and stuff , it used to be part of it , whereas now that 's kind of going away gradually . i do n't particularly like going from indoors to outdoors to indoors but it 's good for tv . bad###weather has wrought havoc with the u.s . open schedule in recent###years with the men 's final , including last year 's epic between murray and novak###djokovic , being pushed back from sunday to monday for the past five years . despite frequent calls for a roof , the usta last year ruled out including one as part of the redevelopment , citing logistical###issues . opened in , arthur###ashe###stadium has a , 500 capacity , making it by far the largest tennis arena in the world but some , such as four times u.s . open###champion john###mcenroe , argued a smaller venue with a roof would have made more sense . the scale of the arena has been one of the main logistical###challenges that has emerged from feasibility###studies with the usta previously saying a roof would be technically###complex and financially challenging . this year 's u.s . open , which starts on august , has a monday finish included as the official final day for the first time . the switch to a scheduled monday finish , unique among the four grand###slam events , has been criticized by the men 's governing###body , the atp .
auburn , ala . gus###malzahn inherited a demoralized auburn team that had just gone through the program 's worst season in decades with a stagnant offense and pliant defense . as is his way , the coach known for fast play on offense went to work in a hurry . he led the second ranked tigers' transformation into southeastern###conference champions and has them in the national###championship###game jan . 6 against no . 1 florida###state . malzahn 's quick work made him the associated press national###coach of the year . it 's very humbling , he said monday . any time you get awards like this , it 's a team thing , as far as our staff and our players . it 's been fun to be a part of this year . malzahn received 33 votes from ap top 25 college###football poll voters to beat out duke 's david###cutcliffe . cutcliffe received 17 votes after leading duke ( 10 3 ) to its first 10 win season . florida###state 's jimbo###fisher and michigan###state 's mark###dantonio each received three votes . malzahn is the second auburn coach to win the award since it began in , joining tommy###tuberville , and the second coach to win it in his first season with a new team . maryland ralph###friedgen was ap coach of the year in , his first season with the terrapins . it 's the fifth time an sec coach has won ap coach of the year . auburn icon bo###jackson likened malzahn 's task to starting with an empty lot upon his hiring in december . he 's got to rebuild that house , said jackson , the 1985 heisman###trophy###winner . the foundation was set with confidence and attitude , reinforced with a message that it was a new day for auburn ( 12 1 ) after a 3 9 season in 2012 that was the tigers' worst since . even more jarring , they had failed to win an sec game . it did n't take the team long to adopt a goal of forging the greatest turnaround in college###football . the result was one of the biggest ever . only hawaii 's . 5 game turnaround from 1999 2000 matches auburn 's one year improvement . it 's a real tribute to our players that they 've bonded together , malzahn said . they 've done everything our coaches have asked , and i think the no . 1 thing is we developed good relationships with our players . we trust our players , the players trust our coaches and we 've got each others' backs . malzahn 's hurry up , no huddle offense has thrived with junior###college transfer nick###marshall at quarterback and tailback tre###mason , a heisman###trophy finalist , behind a sturdy offensive###line . defensive###end nosa eguae said he knew this team was special when we really just bought into coach malzahn 's plan . our goal at the beginning of the year was to have the biggest turnaround in college###football , eguae said . we knew the only way to do that was to get better every single day . tuesdays and wednesdays ( on game weeks ) were big for us because those are our work days and we got better . we beat some teams that people thought we could n't###beat . the confidence boost was so dramatic that defensive###end dee ford wondered publicly back in november , why not win it all ? that seemingly far fetched utterance followed a 45 41 road upset of johnny###manziel then no . 7 texas a m . it was the tigers' biggest###win before beating defending###national###champion alabama and , then , missouri in the sec###championship###game . that followed a game###winning###touchdown in the final###seconds against mississippi###state and a 35 21 loss to lsu after falling behind 21 0 in the first 18 minutes . the mississippi###state game , finding a way to drive the field and win that game in the end , said a lot about our team , malzahn said . lsu , we had a chance to shut her down in a tough environment , and they kept fighting . the pivotal game , though , was probably texas a m . at the time they were one of the top teams in the country , one of the toughest places to play , malzahn said . our offense drove the field with under two minutes to score , and then we held the best player in college###football ( manziel ) out of the end###zone on the last drive , which nobody had done that up to that point . when we walked off that field , we felt like we could play with anybody .
all of the familiar opening day sights were present monday###afternoon at citi###field the clubhouse pleasantries and on field pageantry , the overstuffed press###box , the freshly trimmed grass and even some sporadic shreds of sun . and when the first nine innings of the season were over , the result for the mets was a familiar one , too . for all of the ups###and###downs experienced by the franchise over the years , it has usually performed well on opening day . by sauntering to an 11 2 victory over the san###diego###padres on monday , the mets improved their game 1 record to . one hundred and sixty one games remain , and the team 's prospects for the season remain dim . but opening day has never been about measured rhetoric . obviously , it 's tough to guarantee wins and losses , but if you 're a fan of baseball and kind of a purist , this is going to be a fun team to watch , said david###wright , the team 's captain . you 've got the guys who bring the energy , the guys who play the game hard , play the game the right way , scrappy . there 's a ton of adjectives you can use to describe this team . the buzz on monday centered on the 13 hit effort from the mets' lineup , the sizzling grand###slam from the new center###fielder collin cowgill , and the performance by the left hander jon###niese , who pitched six and two thirds solid innings before walking off to a standing###ovation from the announced sellout###crowd of , 053 . for the mets and their fans , this was a promising sign for the future . for all of the racket about how the minor###league prospect zack wheeler and the sophomore star matt###harvey could headline the mets' staff for years to come , niese figures to be just as key a figure for any potential club revival . niese , 26 , who signed a multiyear contract extension last year , was thrust into the role of opening###day###starter this season after the left hander johan###santana , the team 's former ace and highest###paid###player , was sidelined in spring###training by a recurrence of the shoulder###injury that led him to miss all of the 2011 season . manager terry###collins has since called niese the new leader of the staff , a characterization the pitcher has tried to parry . eyeing the occasion , niese pledged over the weekend to remain###calm . afterward , he said the result of that effort was mixed . i 'm not going to lie , he said , the adrenaline was pumping . before niese took his solitary place on the mound , the field grew crowded for the intricate pregame ceremony . hundreds of volunteers and first responders from hurricane###sandy relief efforts were honored on the outfield grass . the players and coaches lined up alongside them as their names were announced the loudest boos were reserved as always for the mets' medical###staff . the actress emmy###rossum sang the national###anthem . the former player rusty###staub threw out the first pitch . finally , niese got to work mastering the padres . he threw 101 pitches , allowing 4 hits , 2 walks and 2 runs , while striking out 4 hitters . his continued evolution as a pitcher his increasing ability to mix cutters , two seam fastballs and changeups alongside his signature curveball was on display as he kept the padres off balance . and his slip ups were minimal . he allowed a walk and hit a batter to start the third , setting the stage for carlos###quentin 's run###scoring single to center . but the padres did not score again until the sixth , when yonder###alonso pounded a hanging curveball over the right field fence for a solo home###run . this being his first home###opener , it 's a lot of pressure , catcher john###buck said . and in my opinion , he stepped up to it and did what a no . 1 should do . niese received plenty of help from his teammates , who by major###league standards are a motley group . wright , the team 's only household name , noted that its victories would be hard earned through collective effort . that was the case monday . ruben tejada , who batted . 096 in spring###training , put the mets ahead in the second when he pulled a two out double into the left###field corner , sending catcher buck rumbling home from first base . niese came up next and flicked a single over third base , making it . the next inning , marlon###byrd , who was signed this winter to a minor###league deal before winning a job as the team 's everyday right fielder , lifted a run###scoring single to left , and two batters later , buck lined a single to center , making it . the mets kept going in the fourth , forcing padres starter edinson###volquez from the game by putting the first two men on base . but reliever anthony bass could not clean up the inning , as daniel###murphy , wright and byrd each drove in one run . the mets scored nine runs with two outs , and afterward collins lauded the mets' resilience . you grind out at bats , he said . you do n't give up with two strikes . you do n't give up with two outs , especially with guys in scoring###position . the day of celebration was capped in the seventh , when cowgill , acquired this winter through a mostly unheralded trade , crushed a low flying grand###slam to left###field off reliever brad brach . after the victory , collins talked again about the task of gaining credibility with fans . it is a daunting one . to many , the mets appear destined for a fifth straight losing###season . one win will not change that perception , but it seemed to be enjoyed nonetheless . the mets placed four players on the 15 day disabled###list , retroactive to march johan###santana ( shoulder capsule tear , frank###francisco ( elbow inflammation , jenrry mejia ( elbow tendon inflammation ) and shaun###marcum ( biceps tendinitis .
when kevin###whately shot his first appearance as detective sergeant robbie lewis of oxford , england , neither he nor anyone else knew that one of television 's most enduring characters was being born . that was more than a quarter century ago , in the first episode of the much loved british series inspector###morse , in which mr . whately played the working###class foil to the hero , the cultured and egotistical detective###inspector played by john###thaw . after 33 feature###length###episodes of morse , followed by a five year break , mr . whately and a higher###ranking lewis returned in inspector lewis , which has run for 27 episodes across seven seasons . both itv network shows are at best cult favorites in the united###states , where they have been shown as part of pbs 's masterpiece mystery ! , and most viewers would n't know that the 26 year connection of lewis and mr . whately exceeds anything in american prime time . the closest competition is the voice###cast of the simpsons , at 24 years and counting . among flesh and blood characters , mr . whately 's lewis has six years on james###arness 's marshal dillon ( gunsmoke ) and kelsey###grammer 's frasier###crane ( cheers and frasier , though those were uninterrupted runs . all good things come to an end , however , even dependable detectives . the current season of inspector lewis , which begins sunday , may be the character 's last call , though mr . whately has referred to his decision to walk away from the show as a sabbatical and left###open the possibility of more episodes . character and actor have aged gracefully together , from fresh faced 35 year olds to boyish 62 year olds . during that time mr . whately and his writers have managed to let lewis grow from the sidekick on morse , whom mr . whately has called a donkey , to the wise veteran of his own show while staying remarkably true to the conception of the role . to balance the mercurial and overbearing morse , lewis was a plain spoken everyman with a sneaky , sardonic wit . he was stubborn but principled and compassionate , arriving at the answers more slowly than morse but with less collateral###damage to the feelings of others . as a detective###inspector with a high###strung intellectual , hathaway ( laurence###fox , for a sergeant lewis has remained###quiet and solid , if a bit cranky , an oasis of calm in a television landscape crowded with obsessive detective geniuses derived from sherlock###holmes . he 's a type himself , the born copper whose utter reliability hides his doubts and weaknesses , but he 's unusual for being defined not by his competency or his demons but by his decency . the qualities that morse mocked ( but eventually honored , with his dying###words , thank lewis for me ) defined the very different kind of lead character that lewis would become . the three episodes of the current season are typical inspector lewis the mysteries are convoluted and not so interesting , but the picturesque environs of oxford and the comfortable byplay among lewis and hathaway their boss , chief###superintendent innocent ( rebecca front and the winsome pathologist laura hobson ( clare###holman ) more than compensate . the excruciatingly slow courtship of lewis and hobson progresses while cases involving murderous psychics and a dodgy funeral###parlor are solved , and the former theology student hathaway continues to have doubts about his fitness for police work . knowing that this might be the last hurrah , the writers and directors have given these episodes a valedictory quality that edges up to but does n't cross the line of mawkishness the final , silent fade out is both moving and appropriately modest . and lewis is always lewis . in the first episode of inspector###morse , he begged off a trip to the pub with his alcoholic boss because it was his night with the kids . as inspector lewis comes to a close , he 's ready to give up the whole grind to spend more time with them . you never really believe it when american tv cops say that , but after a quarter century , we can trust lewis .

milton , ga . a referee 's whistle halted play during a recent game at milton high , a school situated among horse farms in an affluent###area north of atlanta . a foul had been called , leaving the culprit 's coach mystified . zach hodskins , a senior guard , was hand checking with both hands , the official explained . hey , hodskins said , i do n't even have two hands . born without a left###hand and forearm , hodskins was thought to have a better chance to become president of the united###states , as a relative imagined when he was an infant , than to play basketball for a college powerhouse . yet the university of florida , which won back to back national###titles in the past decade and reached the n.c.a.a . tournament 's round of 8 the past three years , recently guaranteed him a roster###spot for next season by designating him a preferred walk on . after people watch hodskins sink 3 point###shots , lunge for loose###balls and unleash his unusual brand of play , what they notice almost as much as his missing hand is the chip on his shoulder . he has converted years of slights , perceived and real , into a continual source of energy that compels him to set lofty goals . at nearly 6 feet 4 inches , hodskins is a strong passer with extraordinary range . he does n't have 3 point range it 's in the gym range , kramer said . cross halfcourt , he 's in range after a dribble or two . hodskins , who averaged 11 points a game last season and is averaging 6 points and . 3 assists per game this season , would be assured significant playing time , perhaps even a starting###role , at a lower level college . but his nature made him accept the gators . zach wants the biggest###challenge , his father , bob , said . he has such an extreme desire to prove himself at the highest###level he can . bob and stephanie hodskins did not know that zach would be born without half a limb . early on , they pledged to rear him as they did his two older###sisters not that he would have tolerated any coddling . if you ever tried to help him up , bob hodskins said , he would n't have wanted that . a daredevil from the beginning , zach would climb out of his crib with a loud thud , alarming his parents . since then , he has dabbled in various sports , from skimboarding to triathlon . stephanie hodskins yielded to one assumed limitation and bought zach slip on shoes to spare him laces . yet he gravitated to shoes with laces , tying them at school as a sort of performance###art on request . when hodskins locked in on basketball , his footwear of choice became high top sneakers . he never hid an ambition to play in college , saying recently , i never doubted myself , even though a lot of people did . to them , he said , just watch . for every pickup game captain who did not choose him and every amateur###athletic###union program that did not invite him , hodskins stockpiled motivation . concern that he was pushing himself too hard tempered his parents' pride . bob hodskins would tape the calloused fingers on zach 's right hand when they bled from marathon solo workouts . dial it back , his father would tell him . you do n't have to prove yourself every day . zach would hear none of it . i love my competitiveness , he said . it got me to where i am today . in middle###school , he went out for cross###country , primarily as conditioning for basketball . he promptly placed second in a meet that left him so exhausted his parents feared for his health . zach 's explanation allowing anyone to beat me was unacceptable . his parents removed him from the team . we tried to tell him , 'you ca n't be perfect , ' bob hodskins said . he expects to be so . the family found two a.a.u . coaches who helped hodskins develop a repertory of moves , like a crossover dribble between the legs , to minimize the effect of his disability . fine###tuning took place at gyms , playgrounds and , most often , the hodskinses' driveway . the continual thumping of the ball planted a nagging question would the investment pay off ? zach 's parents never imagined how much it would . a year ago , a scouting service posted a one minute###clip of hodskins 's highlights on youtube that has nearly four million views .

flying over alaska in the wintertime is a spectacular experience . at , 000 feet , the state 's rugged beauty unfolds , a succession of white###mountain peaks against steel blue###skies , icy lakes and frozen rivers that snake as far as the eye can see . it 's an awesome sight , wild and pristine , that glows in a thousand hues of red , orange and pink when the sun sets against the horizon . but then , you have to land . juneau 's airport is surrounded by mountains , the approach often buffeted by treacherous wind###shear . sitka 's one small runway is on a narrow###strip###of###land surrounded by water . and in kodiak , the landing###strip ends###abruptly at a mountainside . the airport approach is so tricky that first officers are not allowed to land there only captains are trusted to do so . doug wahto knows these airports well . he grew up in juneau , worked as a commercial###fisherman and builder and started###flying with alaska###airlines in . as a pilot , he honed the art of reading wind conditions by looking at how snow blew over mountain###ridges . mr . wahto retired six years###ago , but not before seeing the transformation of flying in alaska and of the airline where he spent his career . alaska###airlines is puny compared to the major carriers it has 124 planes , while united###airlines has more than 700 and four times as many passengers . but because of the state 's topography and extreme###weather , it was the first to develop satellite guidance , a navigation technique that has transformed landing at alaska 's tricky airports . the technique is now at the heart of the federal###aviation###administration 's plan to modernize the nation 's air###traffic system , a project that is expected to cost tens###of###billions###of###dollars over the coming###decades . it does n't take a rocket scientist , mr . wahto says , or a crusty old dog like me to fly these approaches anymore . largely because of that technology , flying in alaska is now remarkably reliable even in the dead of winter , when it is snowing , when there are just two hours of daylight , when runways are made slippery by ice or sleet , when winds###blow at more than 50 miles an hour and pilots can barely see out the windshield . when , in other words , no one in his right mind would want to land a boeing 737 with 140 passengers on a , 000 foot runway . alaska###airlines , in fact , had the industry 's best on time performance for the third consecutive year in , with 87 percent of flights landing on time , according to flightstats , a data provider . that reliability means a lot in a state where air travel is often the only option , and where alaska is the only commercial###jet carrier with in state###routes . the airline flies to 16 towns accessible only by plane or boat , and , in doing so , ferries food and medical supplies , takes thousands of oil workers above the arctic###circle and operates as the biggest air shipper for the state 's fisheries . this role as primary transport for in the state is still a healthy business , but alaska###airlines has prospered by expanding its services . from its seattle base , it now has a bigger presence than other airlines along much of the west###coast . in , it moved into hawaii its flights to the state now account for 20 percent of its available seat miles , an industry standard for measuring capacity . that is more than the 17 percent in alaska itself . megamergers , most recently of us airways and american###airlines , have redrawn the boundaries of domestic carriers , concentrating the business as never before . alaska###airlines , for its part , has cultivated staunch independence . unlike carriers that have faced###bankruptcy or acquisition , alaska has turned a profit for 33 of the last 39 years . in , it had a record 316 million in net###income , up 29 percent from . although it started in a sparsely###populated , meteorologically unwelcoming , financially challenging corner of the country , alaska has built a successful franchise that is the envy of many rivals .
boston david wheeler stood in the well of a federal courtroom here wednesday , gesturing toward james ( whitey ) bulger , the elderly###man who was once the overlord of the boston underworld and who had ordered his father 's murder . shame on you , mr . bulger , mr . wheeler declared . for all your notoriety , you are a punk and you do n't even matter anymore . you 've###turned from a government sponsored assassin to a pile of jailhouse rags . and so it went , for 90 minutes at mr . bulger 's sentencing###hearing , which followed his conviction in august for 11 murders and multiple racketeering charges . one after the other , grieving widows and fatherless children , now in middle###age , stepped###forward , many to curse the man who had robbed them of their loved ones , others to describe the holes that were suddenly###left in their lives . we were a happy , loving young family with hopes and dreams , and he was the soul of our family , said patricia donahue , whose husband , michael , was an innocent###bystander when he was gunned down . then on may , 1982 , a complete stranger named whitey###bulger crossed our paths , and everything we knew was gone in the blink of an eye . others poured out the venom that had been eating at them for decades . you thought you were an irish icon , but you are a domestic###terrorist fueled by greed , said sean mcgonagle , whose father , paul , was another bulger victim . no one cares what legacy you leave or what code you live by , he said as he called the gangster a mentally deficient , sad , lonely old man . some called him a coward others , a rat . mr . bulger , 84 , wearing an orange jumpsuit , rarely looked up as he scribbled on a yellow pad . the only word he uttered was no after judge denise casper of federal###district court asked him if he wanted to say anything before his sentencing on thursday . it was a striking scene , not only for the range of emotion on display but also for the sharp reversal of mr . bulger 's fortunes . he once held this city captive in what prosecutors have described as a murderous reign###of###terror from the 1960s into the 1990s . now , with the tables turned , many who had lived in fear of mr . bulger were condemning him . but while they were no longer afraid , they were hardly triumphant . their lives had been irrevocably altered , their murdered loved ones had missed important milestones in their lives , and they bared their anger and sorrow . i think of the things he missed out on in my life , said bill o'brien jr . , whose father was killed four days before mr . o'brien was born . at baseball games , he said , i saw all those other fathers with their sons , and me just standing there , wishing i had someone cheering me on , wishing i had someone adjusting my baseball###cap . many acknowledged that the absent loved ones were not perfect . but , they said , that did not justify their killings . my father was no boy###scout , mr . mcgonagle said , but he was a better man than you could ever be . mrs . donahue chose to share cherished memories , like the christmas eves her husband spent assembling bicycles for their three boys only to see in the morning that he had put the wrong handlebars on the wrong bikes . he fancied himself a good cook , she said , but often you did n't know what you were eating . theresa bond , whose father , arthur barrett , was shot in the head by mr . bulger , was nonetheless charitable toward him . could you please look at me ? she asked quietly as she began . he barely raised his head . i do n't hate you , she said . she asked whether he had remorse for taking her father 's life but did not seem to expect an answer , nor did he give one . i think you do , she concluded . i forgive you . no one used the word closure , but some , like meredith rakes , whose father , stephen , was extorted by mr . bulger , thought her years of agony would now cease . the healing can begin , she said . the nightmare is over , the pain stops here . some relatives talked about the stigma of being associated with a gangland slaying and acknowledged depression and suicide attempts in their families . they often had trouble , they said , with simple questions , like when someone would ask how their father had died . kathleen connors nichols said she struggled with whether to answer that her father had been almost cut in half by a hail of bullets , or to tell the pg version . she said he had been flawed , but that being murdered denied him the chance ever to say he was sorry . steve###davis , whose sister debra was strangled , became overwhelmed with emotion when he spoke . this man has built up so much hate in my heart , i 'd like to strangle him myself , he said . he then erupted in fury that mr . bulger 's eyes were on his writing pad , calling the gangster a vulgar term and demanding , look at me ! mr . bulger put on his black framed glasses and glanced his way . she did not deserve to die this way , mr . davis said . i hope whitey dies the same way my sister did , gasping for breath as he takes his last breath . mr . wheeler unleashed a stinging rebuke of the f.b.i . his father had learned that a retired agent who was providing him security was stealing money from him and sending it to the bulger gang , prompting the gang to send a henchman to kill the father . in court , david wheeler , saying the so called justice###department covered up the murder , declared the f.b.i . as responsible as the defendant sitting here for his father 's death . there seems little doubt that mr . bulger , old and frail , will die in prison . prosecutors have called for the maximum###punishment of two consecutive###life###sentences , saying he has no redeeming###qualities . the defendant has been getting arrested since the time that harry###truman was president , brian###kelly , a prosecutor , told the court . the carnage he has caused is grotesque .
if professional pride and strong defiance can save the neck of a soccer team manager , then tottenham###hotspur might just have made its point against manchester united on sunday . the game was cast as high###noon at white###hart###lane . the british news###media and the bookmakers had concocted their usual seasonal head hunt of premier###league managers and coaches in time for christmas . one betting###company , william###hill , forecast that spurs manager andr###villas###boas would be gone by midnight on sunday . it is a game of casual brutality . the coaches are given survival odds similar to turkeys' at this time of year . and bookmakers who complain about illegal betting and attempts to fix matches have their own league###table of the doomed coaches . before spurs held united to a tenacious and well deserved 2 2 draw , the shortest odds in this very odd game held that villas###boas , then fulham manager martin###jol and norwich###city 's chris###hughton were the men targeted by the public 's bets . fulham 's new owner , shahid###khan , did dismiss jol on sunday###night , but others are holding their fire . the team 's response today was good , villas###boas said on television moments after the final whistle . i am extremely###happy with the response of the players after the setback against manchester###city , he said , referring to the 6 0 capitulation of his team in manchester the previous weekend . there is obviously an agenda it 's pretty clear , villas###boas continued . but the players showed strength of character , great team spirit , and with a not bad result against the premier###league champion , they deserve respect . yes , they do . respect , and perhaps a period of patience and understanding from the tottenham board , which authorized the sale three months###ago of the team 's star , gareth###bale , and spent 110 million###pounds , or 180 million , on seven new players , all from other countries and none with any experience in the english###league . whether villas###boas , or spurs' new technical###director , the italian franco baldini , is principally responsible for choosing those imported players is not clear . but it is villas###boas who must integrate them into a team capable of at least finishing in the top four places in england , thus qualifying for the holy###grail of the champions###league . so far , so uncertain . before the collapse at city , spurs had looked solid but unexciting . tottenham fans demand more . their motto is glory , glory . they expect soccer with a swagger they accept defeat provided it comes in an adventurous way . villas###boas is a careful student of coaching theory , and a cautious man in terms of setting up a team first and foremost to be hard to defeat . his predecessor , harry###redknapp , was the opposite , a swashbuckling coach , a man whose forte was instinct and who dared to risk everything on an attacking game . led in the attack by wayne###rooney , who scored his team 's goals , one from the penalty###spot , united arrived unbeaten in 11 matches , and with a 5 0 away victory over bayer###leverkusen fresh in the memory . spurs took the lead after 18 minutes when paulinho , one of their brazilians , won a free###kick just outside the penalty###box . kyle###walker fired a fierce low shot straight at the defensive###wall supposedly protecting the goalkeeper . to a man , everyone in that line jumped , and the shot passed###beneath them into the goal . walker , though , was guilty of a hapless error in handing the initiative back to united a quarter of an hour later . he allowed a swinging cross from phil###jones to bounce off his shin , and rooney was in like a piranha to reach the ball ahead of sandro 6 yards out . that was rooney 's 163rd goal in the premier###league , tying him with robbie###fowler for fifth in league history . but spurs wrested the initiative back early in the second half when sandro struck a shot from 20 yards that was beautiful in its violence . the ball rose off his right foot , swerved in midair and curled inside the far top corner of the net at a pace such that no goalkeeper could have intercepted it . now would tottenham consolidate its advantage ? could it hold on for its first victory over united in london since ? not even for five minutes . spurs goalie hugo###lloris , who sustained a concussion during a home###game last month , made a rash error of judgment , diving to grab the leg of united 's danny###welbeck as he strode through . a definite penalty###kick , and one that rooney smacked with uncompromising force straight down the center of the goal . that , for all the efforts of both sides and for all the intrigue , was the final swing of the pendulum . the draw was just , and spurs' walker made a promise we 've bought a lot of players , good players , he said , adding it might take a bit of time , but i 've every faith in the players and the gaffer . we 'll be up there at the finish , i guarantee it . all bets are off , then .
los###angeles for college###basketball coaches , n.c.a.a . tournament preparation extends beyond white boards and practices and game strategy . this advance work is less about their preferred###style of play and more about their preferred###style of dress . the custom suits . the lucky ties . the hair product . this is where fast breaks meet fashion forward . or backward . or sideways . it happens several times each game , when the camera pans toward the sideline , and there , amid fans clad in their team###colors and players dressed in their uniforms , stands the one guy who is dressed up . while n.f.l . coaches can make famous a hooded sweatshirt , and baseball managers wear###uniforms to sit###in dugouts , college###basketball is all about the suits . and the mousse . this can create a first impression or reinforce an existing one and not always in a good way . jeff halmos of the men 's design firm shipley halmos is a college###basketball fan . his firm was nominated for the gq cfda best new designer award in . coaches wear suits because that 's what they do , because no one has ever bucked the trend , he said in a telephone interview . they follow###suit . i 'm all for it . i 'm not a big fan of the bill belichick fashion style , looking like you just rolled out of bed . i do n't think that 's cool . you do n't have to go all craig###sager with it , but it helps to look good . sager , of course , is the sideline###reporter known for his colorful ensembles and one tie that resembles an n.c.a.a . tournament###bracket . most coaches , halmos said , tend to follow a style patterned after pat###riley when he coached . he wore suits that looked as if they came straight out of fashion magazines . they suited his personality , added to his aura . if halmos were to rank coaches according to their style preferences , he said duke 's mike###krzyzewski , harvard 's tommy###amaker , florida 's billy###donovan and villanova 's jay###wright would receive top seed consideration . at least on game day , there is not a sweater vest or track suit among them . now , when it comes to the n.c.a.a . tournament , the sideline can sometimes resemble a red###carpet . most coaches like to say they put little thought into what they will wear , or how they will wear it . yet almost all look perfectly coiffed once the cameras turn on . i 'm an old school louisiana country boy , said southern 's roman banks , whose team lost to gonzaga in the round of . two button , three button coats . basic shirts and ties . nothing that would draw###attention to myself . he added i 've###heard about some of those other guys . the expensive haircuts . the tanning . it is always the other guys . always . often , the fashion statements made by coaches reveal as much about their superstitions as their preference for armani . before bruce###pearl became an espn###analyst , he always wore suspenders underneath his suit###jacket . a booster had told him a long time ago he needed to wear something to distinguish himself . the suspenders worked , but the only time anyone saw them was when i took my jacket off , pearl said . i only took my jacket off when i was mad at the officials , which was about half the time . pearl also wore a certain tie only until he lost in it . the same went for bucknell 's dave paulsen and north###carolina a t 's cy alexander , who shelved each suit he lost in throughout the season . i did n't###pay a ton of attention to my wardrobe , pearl said . but my kids did 'dad , that suit is so old ! ' some coaches are required to wear a suit and tie , like donovan at florida . that is one of the gators' policies . the hair product is his own undertaking , not part of the contract . not that donovan follows that policy throughout the game . i take my jacket off before the game ever starts , he said . it does n't make any difference to me . if it was up to me , i would n't wear a suit and tie . but once the game starts , you do n't even realize what you have on .
for three consecutive###days , the boston###red###sox have battered the yankees' pitching staff . thunderous sounds have reverberated throughout yankee###stadium , with one crushing blow after another . boston 's hitters have not been fooled . the yankees climbed back into the playoff###race in the last few weeks by outslugging their competition , but against the red###sox this week , their pitching staff has been overmatched . after beating the yankees , 13 9 , on saturday , the red###sox are one win from a four game sweep that could bury the yankees' chances of making the postseason . while the yankees' offense has done its part in the three games by scoring 25 runs , their pitching staff has allowed . for the first time in franchise###history , the yankees have lost three consecutive###games in which they have scored at least seven runs . right now , they 're not missing pitches , yankees manager joe###girardi said of the boston hitters . adding to the yankees' misery , derek###jeter left the game in the sixth###inning , limping into the dugout after reaching###base on a single . girardi said he did not like the way jeter had been running . girardi also said jeter 's inaccurate throw from shortstop in the top of the sixth may have been caused in part by discomfort in his surgically repaired left ankle . yeah , there 's concern , girardi said . let 's see how he feels tomorrow . a precautionary ct###scan showed no fracture in the ankle . but the results of the scan will be sent to robert###anderson , the charlotte , n.c. , doctor who performed jeter 's surgery last october . i think the leg is something he still deals with trying to play every day in a pennant###race , said brian###cashman , the yankees' general###manager . if these games did n't count , he could take a few days off where his bounce back would be different . he 's like everyone else . he knows there 's no days , no time for the weary here . and he 's the king of toughness as well . he 's doing everything he can to get out there and play . a late###inning rally by the yankees was not enough to salvage saturday 's game . after the yankees rallied from a five run deficit thursday ( only to lose in extra###innings , and the red###sox rallied to win from a five run deficit friday , the stage seemed to be set for another improbable comeback . after falling behind early , 12 3 , the yankees scored four runs in the sixth and two in the eighth to make it a three run game . but the red###sox added a run in the ninth and moved to the verge of a sweep . the yankees' chances of making the playoffs are grim but still conceivable . the tampa###bay###rays' recent struggles have kept the yankees , who started the day two and a half games out of the second wild###card position , from losing too much ground , although the baltimore###orioles and the cleveland###indians have pulled###ahead of them . but it is difficult to imagine the yankees making up much ground with an injured jeter and a battered bullpen . the relievers have been a strength for most of the season , but their performance and health are declining . entering saturday 's game , girardi knew that the injured relievers david robertson ( shoulder , boone###logan ( biceps ) and shawn kelley ( triceps ) would be unavailable . girardi was also without joba###chamberlain , adam warren and preston claiborne , who had pitched extensively in the last few days . the former starter phil###hughes , sent to the bullpen this week , pitched on friday and was not used on consecutive###days . robertson is not expected back for at least another few days , logan had a magnetic###resonance###imaging test that showed inflammation , and kelley might miss more time . with the notable###exception of mariano###rivera , the yankees' relief squad on saturday bore a strong resemblance to their bullpen at class###aaa scranton wilkes###barre jim###miller , brett marshall , matt daley , cesar cabral and dellin betances . but the yankees wound up having no need for late###inning relief to set up a potential save . the red###sox quickly hammered starter david huff , who had taken hughes 's place in the rotation . by the end of huff 's outing , which lasted three and a third innings , boston had nine runs and eight hits , including two homers . entering the game , huff had allowed just two runs and seven hits in 16 innings of relief . they capitalized on mistakes , huff said . it was terrible . to come off what i had been doing and to have that today , it 's embarrassing . hiroki###kuroda will start sunday and try to prevent a boston sweep . in his last four starts , kuroda , the yankees' best starter for most of the season , has a . 43 earned###run###average and has allowed six home###runs . the red###sox have hit eight homers against the yankees in the last three games , three of them by mike###napoli . he hit two on saturday , giving him two multihomer games at yankee###stadium this year . boston 's offense appears unstoppable at the moment . the yankees' pitching staff is the most vulnerable it has been all year . red###sox center###fielder jacoby###ellsbury returned to boston on saturday after an m.r.i . showed swelling and inflammation in his right foot . ellsbury was in a walking boot and was on his way to colorado for a second opinion . manager john###farrell said the

cincinnati kevin huber is scheduled for surgery on friday for his broken###jaw , a season ending injury that left the bengals looking for another punter and holder to help them through their playoff surge . huber got hurt during a 30 20 loss in pittsburgh on sunday###night . terence garvin blocked him during antonio###brown 's 67 yard###punt###return for a touchdown , hitting huber 's chin with the top of his helmet . the bengals ( 9 5 ) held tryouts for five punters on tuesday and signed shawn powell . the second year punter was released by buffalo on oct . 4 after rough games against baltimore and cleveland . powell also will hold on field###goal attempts and extra###points by kicker mike###nugent . kevin has done a great job in his tenure here , powell said . hopefully i can get to do a little bit of what he 's done to help the team continue on its path of success . huber went on injured###reserve tuesday , ending his streak of 81 consecutive###games played , the longest on the roster . the bengals' medical###staff expects huber to make a full recovery and return next season . there should be no future ramifications whatsoever , coach marvin###lewis said . players had tuesday off , but huber visited paul###brown###stadium and briefly watched the tryouts . on his way out , he told the associated press that he broke his jaw at the chin . he also has a crack in one neck vertebra that 's expected to heal without problem . huber grew up in cincinnati , attended the university of cincinnati and was drafted by the bengals in the fifth round in . he 's been a vital part of the bengals' success with his long punts . last season , he set club records for net and gross average . he ranks eighth in the nfl this season with a net average of . 5 yards . we 're replacing a kid who 's been a fine player for us , lewis said . and unquestioned , he 's a great person , a kid that we 've###spent a great deal of time with , with him growing up here , going to uc , us coaching him at the senior###bowl . he 's done a great job since we 've drafted him . so it 's a shame that he misses out on the rest of the season . lewis declined to express an opinion about garvin 's block on huber , which was n't penalized but is likely to draw a fine from the league . i think there 's been enough talk about it , lewis said . there 's nothing i can do that will affect it any differently now , so we just need to move on . the bengals chose powell for their home###game on sunday against minnesota ( 4 9 1 ) in part because of his experience at directional kicking punting the ball to a specific###area of the field . powell did it with buffalo , which gave him an edge with cincinnati . i was lucky , he said . i do n't want to be on the outside looking in . i like to be on the inside . powell punted and held for kicks at florida###state . he replaced brian###moorman in buffalo a few weeks into the 2012 season under coach chan###gailey . powell felt his job was in jeopardy after he shanked punts during a 23 20 win over baltimore on sept . 29 . the bills released him a day after their 37 24 loss to the browns . cleveland 's travis benjamin returned seven punts for a club###record 179 yards , including a 79 yard touchdown . notes lewis said the rest of the team came through the game without serious setback . linebacker james###harrison left in the first quarter with a concussion . we seem to be ok , he said . so far , so good . ... cb terence###newman 's sprained left knee is improving and he 's expected to do more in his workouts this week . newman missed the game in pittsburgh . at the end of last week , he made significant###progress with things , lewis said . it 's a little different playing cornerback , and we 're going to be cautious with him .

ardmore , pennsylvania phil###mickelson moved a step closer to one of his biggest goals , a u.s . open###title , as he emerged from a see saw third round battle at merion to take a one shot lead into sunday 's final round . mickelson rolled in a nine foot###birdie###putt at the 254 yard 17th hole to leapfrog playing partner luke donald , who slipped out of the lead with a bogey on the mammoth par three . four times major winner mickelson , looking for his first u.s . open###title after finishing runner up a record five times , bogeyed the daunting 18th hole but still came away with the lead after completing an even par 70 for a one under par 209 total . it is a hard challenge , but it is a lot of fun , said mickelson , keen for the next step in his quest for a first u.s . open crown . let 's go . i ca n't###wait to get back out playing . sunday could be a dream day for mickelson , who would add a missing line to his impressive resume with an open victory as he celebrates his 43rd birthday and father 's day with his dad watching him play at merion . i 've had opportunities in years past , and it has been so fun , even though it 's been heart breaking to come so close a number of times and let it slide , mickelson said . one shot back after a rousing battle atop the leaderboard were 2011 masters champion charl###schwartzel , who posted , and americans hunter###mahan ( 69 ) and steve###stricker . former world number one donald , who double bogeyed the 18th after struggling with the deep rough to finish with a , was another shot adrift at one over 211 along with fellow###englishman justin###rose ( 71 ) and 36 hole co leader billy###horschel . i should have done better , said donald , who had taken sole###possession of the lead after schwartzel and mahan both bogeyed the 17th . it was disappointing . but i 'll take the positives out of today , a really solid 16 holes of golf that i played and i 'm only two back . mickelson , the leader after each round , fell from top spot after a bogey on the third hole , but came alive on the back nine with three birdies to fight his way back on a tumultuous day that saw a slew of competitors take turns in charge . the big left hander said he felt better placed to tackle the challenge of winning the u.s . open this time around . i feel better equipped than i have ever felt heading into the final round of a u.s . open , said mickelson , who has three masters and a pga###championship title to his credit . my ball striking is better than it 's ever been . my putting is better than it has been in years , and i feel very comfortable on this golf course . i love it . given that i 've had some past major championships now and some success here ... i think it 's going to be fun . i do n't think i feel any more pressure than anybody else who wants to win . six different players mickelson , horschel , donald , rose , australian john###senden and schwartzel had turns in the lead over the first nine holes . world number one tiger###woods , hoping to end a five year drought in the majors dating back to the 2008 u.s . open , and world number two rory###mcilroy also moved within three shots of the pace with birdies on the first hole . however , the high###profile duo , playing their third successive round together , staggered through the rest of the way . woods shot 76 to plunge 10 shots off the pace , and mcilroy registered 75 to be nine behind mickelson . after the merry###go###round of leaders in the front nine , schwartzel and donald settled into a tie for supremacy after the turn and were joined at two under by mahan when he birdied the 16th . mahan and schwartzel both bogeyed the last two holes to yield the top position to donald , who was then overtaken by mickelson . schwartzel said he knows what it will take for him to add a second major title sunday to his augusta triumph . you 're going to have to give every single shot all your attention , the south###african said . there 's no hole where you can sort of ease back and sort of freewheel a bit . every shot that you hit is really intense . three shots off the pace was australian jason day , who registered a 68 for two over 212 despite a bogey at the last . one more shot away was rickie###fowler who carded 67 for the best round of the day . senden , who briefly led by one , faded with five bogeys in the last 11 holes to post a , finishing six strokes off the lead . coming up big at the end was mickelson , who was clearly excited about what sunday could mean . it 's got the makings to be something special , but i still have to go out and perform and play some of my best golf , he said .
los###angeles although lane###kiffin is grateful for southern###california athletic###director pat###haden 's###video vote of confidence , his job###security wo n't alter kiffin 's urgency to get the trojans back on top . usc released a video in which haden strongly###backed kiffin on thursday###night , the day before pac 12 football media day in culver###city . i anticipate the media will ask me if our football###coach is on the hot###seat this year , haden said in the video . here is my answer , and will be my answer whenever i 'm asked he is not . haden also said he is behind lane###kiffin 100 percent . usc endured a hugely disappointing###season last year , going 7 6 after starting with the preseason no . 1 ranking . despite the presence of senior quarterback matt###barkley and star receivers robert###woods and marqise###lee , the trojans lost five of their final six games , finishing their embarrassing slide with losses to crosstown foe ucla , perennial rival notre###dame and georgia###tech in the sun###bowl . yet haden and usc president max nikias have never wavered in their support of their attention attracting coach , who is 25 13 after three seasons under severe scholarship restrictions from ncaa sanctions handed down shortly after kiffin was hired in . obviously , it 's a positive , kiffin said about haden 's vote of confidence . it 's not a negative to me from my standpoint as a head###coach , but it was n't a surprise to me , because i deal with pat on a daily###basis , so i have felt pat 's support and max 's support the whole time we 've been here . kiffin served as an assistant###coach under pete###carroll at usc before brief stops with the oakland###raiders and the university of tennessee . he left the volunteers after just 14 months to replace carroll following the 2009 season , only to see the program buckled by sanctions a few months later . usc was hit with a two year bowl ban , four years of probation , 30 lost scholarships and 14 vacated victories for misdeeds involving heisman###trophy winning tailback reggie###bush . faced with obvious depth problems and the school 's tarnished reputation before his first game , kiffin has recruited exceptionally well and run a largely clean program at usc , getting into only minor compliance scrapes . but his sometimes brash personality and the trojans' underachievement in two of his three seasons have led to an uneasy relationship between the coach and many of the school 's most ardent fans and alumni . although haden did n't hire kiffin , only taking over the athletic###program several months after ad mike###garrett left , the former usc quarterback has been a firm supporter of kiffin . haden made similar###statements of confidence in kiffin last season , repeatedly dismissing the notion he would abruptly fire his coach . i have felt that they have always looked at the big###picture of things and taken the whole time we 've been here into account , kiffin said of haden and nikias . they have a better understanding of the numbers , of what happened three years###ago with the sanctions , how that impacts us in a bunch of different areas i 'm not going into , but i think they understand that a lot better than a fan would or the media would , because they 're right in the middle of it . usc was picked to finish third in the pac 12 south by the league 's media on friday behind ucla and arizona###state . kiffin has n't picked a successor to four year starter barkley , but lee returns along with tailback silas redd and the usual bumper###crop of elite offensive talent . the trojans' defense , which was repeatedly shredded last year , will have an entirely new look under defensive###coordinator clancy pendergast , who replaced kiffin 's father , monte . it 's been a great transition , usc linebacker hayes pullard said . pendergast brings that swagger that 's been great for us . they simplified this defense for us guys to go out there and just play fast and play to the best of our ability .

aurelien collin , soaked in champagne , pulled the black stocking cap that read mls###cup champions down over his ears and sheepishly shook his head from side to side . collin , a defender for sporting###kansas###city , had never needed to try a penalty###kick in his career . it is unlikely that the next one will compare to the first . collin drove###home the deciding penalty###kick after sporting k.c . and real###salt###lake played to a 1 1 draw saturday in the m.l.s . cup###final in kansas###city , kan . , giving his club its first major###league###soccer title since . i hope i never have to kick another one again , collin said with a smile . alvaro saborio , who missed the western###conference###finals because of an injury , scored for real###salt###lake in the 52nd minute , but collin answered with a header in the 76th minute . it remained 1 1 through regulation and 30 minutes of overtime , and the teams engaged in the longest penalty###kick shootout in championship history one that both sides had chances to win before collin 's shot and a subsequent save by jimmy###nielsen left sporting k.c . with the 7 6 victory . i never think that penalty###kicks are the best way to end a game , but you ca n't just keep going , said sporting k.c . manager peter###vermes , who won the 2000 title with the team then known as the kansas###city###wizards . you have to end it some way . sporting k.c .

spurred by the success of an original game show that rewards knowledge of the bible rather than , say , how much grocery###items cost at the supermarket checkout , the gsn cable channel is considering a dating show with a religious twist congregations will seek suitable mates for single parishioners . at an upfront breakfast in midtown###manhattan on tuesday###morning , gsn outlined its plans for the 2013 14 television season , a season that is being reshaped by the popularity of the american bible challenge , which was introduced during the 2012 13 season and is already back for a second go round . still , gsn executives told###reporters they were not planning on creating a channel dominated by faith###based programming . the network , they said , will continue to offer viewers secular shows like baggage family###feud , in a new iteration with steve###harvey as the host minute to win it , which will have its debut on june 25 with original###episodes and a new host , the olympian apolo###anton###ohno and the newlywed###game , also in a new iteration , with sherri###shepherd as the host . we still need to be a broad###based channel , said amy introcaso davis , executive###vice###president for programming and development at gsn . even so , the success of the american bible challenge , hosted by jeff###foxworthy , is hard to ignore . literally , it put us ahead of the game in the year 's most talked about programming trend , ms . introcaso davis said , referring to the renewed interest among viewers in programming with religious###themes like the bible , the miniseries on the history###channel . the american bible challenge is the most watched series in gsn 's history , ms . introcaso davis said , and in general , it doubles the ratings of anything we 've ever done . the increased viewership for the bible game show , along with more conventional shows like family###feud , helped gsn 's ratings grow among adults ages 18 to 49 as well as adults ages 25 to . and gsn is enjoying much greater interest from the advertising community , said john zaccario , executive###vice###president for advertising sales , adding that he and his colleagues had signed over 100 new advertisers . the proposed dating show with a religious setting , called it takes a church , will ask congregations , pastors , friends and family to find a suitable potential###mate for a parishioner who is single . plans call for hourlong episodes if it becomes a series . the show is a contemporary version of how the ladies of the church are always trying to fix###up the few single parishioners , ms . introcaso davis said , and would be aimed specifically at that new audience that has been brought to gsn by the american bible challenge . it takes a church is one of six original###series in development at gsn , which , like most cable###channels , is trying to significantly###increase the amount of original###programming on its schedule to woo additional viewers and advertisers . the other series being considered by gsn include another dating show , where have you been all my life , which asks a contestant to evaluate three potential suitors based on information about their pasts , using sources like photographs and video###clips . dance rivals , about two dance studios in orem , utah , that compete fiercely against each other , which includes as an executive###producer derek###hough , a professional dancer in the cast of dancing with the stars on abc .

you had your chance . now , it 's out of your hands . if top ranked florida###state and no . 2 ohio###state both win on saturday , they deserve to play for the national###title and no amount of griping from the sec should make a bit of difference . the seminoles have done what they needed to do win every game . ditto for the buckeyes , even if people want to gripe about the quality of the big ten . neither no . 3 auburn nor no . 5 missouri the one loss teams that will meet saturday at the georgia###dome for the sec title should leapfrog ohio###state if the buckeyes emerge with a victory in their own league###championship###game that night . the sec has claimed an unprecedented seven straight national###titles , and some would have you believe it 's almost a birthright that the country 's strongest conference ( no argument there ) should have a representative in the title game , no matter what . it 's like being in the nfl , missouri coach gary###pinkel said friday . every week , you have a high###level game . all i know , added auburn coach gus###malzahn , is we 've got the best league in college###football . but this is n't about the best league , it 's about the two most worthy teams over the course of the entire###season . under this flawed system ( which , thankfully , will be replaced next year by a four team playoff , if you play in a major conference and win all your games , it takes a pretty compelling argument for a one loss team to bump you out of a spot in the bcs championship . let 's start with the tigers from auburn . the best part of their resume is last week 's remarkable victory over two time defending###national###champion alabama , when they returned a missed###field###goal 109 yards for the winning###touchdown on the final play . if you beat the best , they say , you deserve a chance to be the best . the tigers also point to their overall schedule , which included four other games against teams that we ranked in the top 25 when they played . but auburn lost 35 21 at lsu a game that really was n't that close and victories over mississippi , texas a m and georgia do n't look quite as impressive in hindsight . ole###miss finished . johnny###manziel and the aggies slumped to an 8 4 mark that proved you occasionally need to play a little defense . and the victory over georgia might deserve the biggest asterisk of all , since auburn blew a 20 point lead at home and needed the most fortuitous play of the season to pull out the victory a 73 yard###touchdown###pass on fourth and 18 in the final###minute , the ball deflected into the receiver 's hands when two defenders ran into each other going for the interception . auburn ( 11 1 ) could 've bolstered its case with an impressive out of conference win , but there 's nothing persuasive about beating washington###state , arkansas###state , florida###atlantic and lower division western###carolina . nothing against the remarkable job done by first year coach malzahn , who won the sec west with a team that went 3 9 a year ago and was winless in the sec , but it 's not enough to overtake ohio###state . these tigers also had quite a bounce back season , going from 5 7 their first year in the sec to 11 1 and an east###division###title in year . but their case , should they upset auburn , is even weaker than the other tigers . missouri has played five teams that were ranked when they met , but that includes a victory over georgia , which was ravaged by injuries when the tigers pulled off a 41 26 upset between the hedges , as well as wins over ole###miss and texas a m ( already discussed . pinkel 's team routed a ranked florida team , but that means nothing after the gators staggered to a###4 8 record . which brings us to the tigers' only loss a 27 24 setback to south###carolina in double###overtime . missouri led , at home , entering the fourth###quarter . if the tigers had protected that lead , we 'd be leading the call for them to play in the bcs championship ahead of ohio###state . but they did n't . and that 's a big strike against mizzou , which also played an extremely###weak non conference###schedule murray###state , toledo , indiana and arkansas###state . the buckeyes have 24 consecutive###victories since urban###meyer took over as coach , their biggest###selling point . the biggest knock against them is a weak schedule . their only major conference###opponent from outside the big ten was lowly california . the buckeyes beat a couple of ranked###teams , but a 31 24 victory over wisconsin is the only one that still looks impressive . they also won at northwestern , which was 16th at the time but tumbled to a 5 7 finish . ohio###state does deserve kudos , however , for a 63 14 blowout of a respectable penn###state team , not to mention a 34 24 triumph over rapidly improving iowa . critics of the buckeyes say they should 've blown out michigan in what was a down year for the wolverines , instead of needing to stop a two###point###conversion to preserve the victory last week . we 're willing to be a bit more lenient when they were on the road , facing their biggest###rival . so , if ohio###state beats a very good michigan###state team saturday###night in the big ten championship , the spot in pasadena should belong to them , no matter what happens in atlanta . if not , the winner of tigers vs . tigers gets it .

stocks have made investors money for four years , but they have also made them nervous . bonds have been a profitable alternative , but prices are so high that there could be risk in this presumed haven , and in any case yields are near record###lows . a popular third choice , stocks that pay big dividends , offers elements of both types of assets growth###prospects and regular###income that is often higher than that of high quality bonds . high###yield stocks have been valuable portfolio holdings for many decades . research by eugene f . fama of the university of chicago and kenneth r . french of dartmouth has found a strong###correlation between a stock 's total return and its dividend###yield . investing with dividends in mind has been especially fruitful lately . it is not clear whether a desire to own high###yield stocks has raised their performance or the other way around , but spdr s p dividend , an exchange###traded###fund that specializes in them , produced a total return of . 2 percent in the five years through last friday , compared with . 5 percent for spdr s p , an e.t.f . that tracks the standard###poor 's 500 stock###index . but have too many hopped aboard the bandwagon ? high###yield stocks are often cheaper than the broad market because the sorts of companies that make large payouts tend to grow more slowly . the outperformance in recent###years has pushed them to a premium , however the dividend e.t.f . trades at 15 times earnings versus 14 for the s. p . 500 e.t.f . that has led some investment###advisers to express concern that big dividend payers have grown expensive to the point of being risky . others are inclined to trust the wisdom of the masses this time . they find much to recommend in high###yield stocks , but they urge investors to be selective and to judge companies by more than the amount of cash they dispense . in order to find a good dividend paying company , you have to go beyond the dividend , said robert shearer , manager of the blackrock equity dividend fund . a company has to have sufficient profits not just to pay the latest dividend , he explained , but also to expand the business so that it can pay future dividends , preferably in successively higher###amounts . if companies do n't have cash to invest in the business , he said , they wo n't have it to grow dividends , either . the ability to increase dividends is an advantage that stocks have over bonds , which have fixed coupons , and some companies raise their payouts year after year . dividend growth is essential , in mr . shearer 's view , because a stock 's price tends to rise in line with the dividend . that can provide a bigger component of the total return over the long###haul than dividend payments themselves . an emphasis on dividend growth can shift the search for the best income###producing stocks away from the sectors most closely associated with high yields , like utilities and telecommunications . mr . shearer said he was finding better opportunities in industrial companies and providers of consumer products and services , in part because those segments of the market had not been bid up as much as the others . we think there 's still value there , but you have to choose sectors appropriately , he said . joshua peters , editor of the dividendinvestor newsletter published by morningstar , likewise sees richer pickings in sectors not typically associated with strong payouts , like technology and other economically volatile industries . high valuations elsewhere became a deal breaker for him . i trimmed some of the positions i had held for a while and thought highly of because they had gotten too expensive , he said , mentioning real###estate###investment###trusts and tobacco companies in particular . robert t . lutts , chief###investment###officer of cabot money###management , is put off by how expensive dividend stocks in general have become . it has almost gotten to the point where many of these stocks are priced at levels where investors are n't going to be happy with the results going forward , he said . they 're priced at levels that exceed the growth profiles of the companies . mr . lutts considers valuations less stretched for foreign high###yield stocks . he recommends the global x superdividend exchange###traded###fund , which focuses on companies broadly dispersed geographically and commercially . the fund recently traded at just 13 times earnings and yielded . 2 percent . it makes###sense to take a global###perspective , he said . there is less potential for price disappointment because the companies are involved in diverse economies and have strength in their industries . it may be harder to find reasonably priced dividend stocks , but mr . peters is confident that they will continue to appeal to long###term investors after the flow of money from short###term traders eases . very low###interest###rates can persist only for so long as rates rise , he said , the ability of companies to raise payouts will give stocks with healthy yields an edge . the rapid###rise in the number of people in or near retirement will also underpin dividend stocks as the need for income from all sources increases , mr . peters predicted . demographic factors are causing a permanent shift in demand for income as a component of total return , he said . that 's a trend that 's not going away . dividends are going to play a bigger and bigger role in investors' strategies over time .
washington the question for the supreme###court on monday was whether groups receiving federal money to combat aids abroad may be required to adopt###policies opposing prostitution . the answer , judging from the justices' comments in the first half of the argument , seemed to be that the first amendment bars attaching that kind of condition to federal###grants . there have to be some limitations on what type of loyalty###oath you can require them to sign , said chief###justice john g . roberts jr . justice samuel a . alito jr . said that allowing the government to compel speech is a dangerous proposition . justice ruth###bader###ginsburg , too , was skeptical about requiring somebody to say 'i believe this' or 'i agree with the government on that . ' but what seemed like a consensus disintegrated as the argument progressed and the justices started to sort through what conditions might be permitted by the first amendment . thanks to a tenacious argument by a government lawyer , concessions by a lawyer challenging the 2003 law requiring the anti prostitution policy and probing hypothetical questions from the justices , what looked like an easy case at the outset grew more complicated . chief###justice roberts asked whether the government could have required groups receiving money for water projects in south###africa years###ago to adopt###policies opposing apartheid . the question elicited a long###pause from david w . bowker , a lawyer for groups challenging the law . mr . bowker said the anti###apartheid condition might pass first amendment muster if it could be shown to be related to the groups' ability to do their work . the supreme###court 's precedents on so called unconstitutional conditions are confusing , and mr . bowker tried to walk a series of fine###lines . he said the government was free to finance some programs and not others , and conceded that the government may control the speech of groups accepting###money as long as it was in connection with their work on the programs . the flaw in the 2003 law , mr . bowker said , was in requiring that they profess a personal###belief , and refrain from certain private speech outside the context of the government program . in , a divided three judge panel of the united###states court of appeals for the second circuit , in new york , blocked the law , saying it compels grantees to espouse the government 's position on a controversial issue . the full appeals###court declined to rehear the case . mr . bowker said his clients neither promoted prostitution nor approved of it . they would like to be free to engage in this important discussion , mr . bowker said of his clients , and to be unfettered by a policy requirement that demands fealty to the government 's viewpoint . sri srinivasan , a deputy solicitor###general whose nomination to the united###states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit is pending , gave the justices several guideposts . the conditions must be germane , he said . using government money to suppress a viewpoint is not permissible , but the government should be free to choose between groups that share its policy goals and those that oppose them . several justices tested those limits with questions about higher###education , recycling and teenage###pregnancy . justice###alito , perhaps the most skeptical of the law , asked whether groups receiving money under a health###care law could be made to take a stance on the availability of guns . mr . srinivasan said that if the requisite germaneness were satisfied and the government 's goal was not to suppress disfavored speech , such a condition might be permissible . he seemed to make headway by characterizing the required pledge as a selection criterion rather than an effort to force groups to adopt views they did not hold . echoing the point , chief###justice roberts asked mr . bowker why the government would want to sign up with somebody who did n't share the objectives of the program . mr . bowker responded that it would be problematic to deny financing based on a group 's viewpoint . justice antonin###scalia disagreed . they ca n't fund the boy###scouts###of###america because they like the programs that the b.s.a . has ? justice###scalia asked . they have to treat them equivalently with the muslim###brotherhood ? is that really what you 're suggesting ? mr . bowker said the government had not articulated a meaningful limiting principle . on the government 's theory , he said , the government can give anyone in the country a dollar in medicare funds and say , o.k. , now that you 've taken a dollar of our money , we want you to profess your agreement with the affordable###care###act , and we want you to never say anything inconsistent with that in your private speech . justice elena###kagan recused herself from the case united###states###agency###for###international###development v . alliance for open society international , no . 12 10 presumably because she had worked on it as united###states###solicitor###general .
milan evergreen francesco###totti , in his 22nd season with as roma , scored his first goal of the new campaign to give help them to a 3 1 win at parma which maintained their 100 percent record in serie a on monday . new dutch midfield signing kevin strootman was also in inspired form , setting up totti 's goal and converting a penalty as roma overturned a 1 0 halftime###deficit . roma and napoli , the two biggest spenders in the close season , are the only teams to have won their opening three games . they are followed by inter###milan , juventus and fiorentina , all on seven points . parma , under former italy coach roberto###donadoni , broke through six minutes before halftime when frenchman jonathan biabany beat his marker to mattia cassani 's cross and headed in at the near post . roma , who spent around 66 million###euros . 1 million ) in the transfer###window with 16 million of that going on strootman , levelled less than two minutes after the break when miralem pjanjic set up alessandro florenzi who blasted a right foot shot past antonio###mirante . strootman then cleverly set up totti , 36 , who stayed onside and placed his shot beyond miranda in the 70th minute . with five minutes left , ivorian forward gervinho was hauled down by cassani in the area and strootman rifled home the penalty for his first goal since his move from psv###eindhoven . parma have taken only one point from their first three games .
salvador , brazil diego forlan celebrated his 100th cap with a goal at the start of the second half to secure uruguay a 2 1 win over nigeria and all but guarantee their place in next week 's confederations###cup semi###finals . the result continued uruguay 's undefeated###record against african opponents in 12 encounters and left them hot###favourites to join spain in the last four . nigeria must now beat the reigning###world###champions and hope uruguay falter against minnows tahiti . both teams lined up attacking formations with nigeria playing a conventional 4 3 3 and uruguay playing suarez , forlan and cavani together for the first time in the tournament . neither team were able to impose themselves for long###periods , however , and there were few clear###cut chances in an often lacklustre match . it was uruguay who took the lead in the 19th minute when captain diego###lugano was on hand to bundle a low cross from forlan into the net . nigeria slowly came into the game and they equalised in the 37th minute when john###obi###mikel controlled a brown###ideye pass to side foot the ball into the top of the net from 12 yards . uruguay went ahead again in the 51 st minute and it was a move that involved all three of their front men . luis suarez broke from midfield , fed edinson###cavani outside the box and he passed to diego forlan who hammered the ball into the roof of the net from an angle . nigeria saw plenty of the ball in the second half but they seldom threatened fernando###muslera in goal . the best chance of the second period fell to cavani who chested down a lovely cross field pass from forlan but then blazed his shot over . the , 000 capacity arena was less than half full before kickoff , with some fans unable to reach the ground because of violent###protests outside , according to local###media .
boise , idaho san###diego###state had its best performance in its season###finale . behind a swarming defense , an offense fueled by big###plays and opportunistic special teams , the aztecs rolled to a 49 24 victory over buffalo on saturday in the famous###idaho###potato###bowl . for coach rocky###long , it 's the kind of game he has been waiting for his team to put together all season , a win where all three phases worked together , avoided costly mistakes and took full advantage of the miscues of others . i thought that 's the best we 've###played all year , long said . we moved the ball well , we caused turnovers . i thought the turnover battle would decide who won and that 's exactly what happened . we just happened to be on the right side of that battle . takeaways were n't the only factor playing in san###diego###state 's favor . adam muema scored###three###touchdowns and rushed for 230 yards , his fourth###career game with more than 200 yards on the ground . quinn kaehler threw for two more scores and ran for another in leading an offense that generated 460 total###yards . kaehler , who made his first start in the third game , was 15 of 28 for 211 yards , and his two td passes helped the aztecs , 6 2 mountain###west ) pull away early . taking advantage of a pair of costly buffalo turnovers , the aztecs put up 21 straight###points during a 5 minute span in the second and third quarters . with less than a minute left in the first half , aztec safety marcus andrews intercepted joe licata 's pass near midfield and returned it to the 25 to set up kaehler 's first td pass , a 25 yarder to dylan denso that put san###diego###state up 28 10 heading into halftime . buffalo coughed up the ball on the opening kick in the third quarter , setting up the aztecs at the bulls . five plays later , kaehler fired an 11 yard###pass###to###tight###end adam roberts at the back of the end###zone to stretch the lead to . the aztecs won eight of their last 10 games . the bowl victory is the first in the postseason since 2010 when they beat navy in the poinsettia###bowl and the first postseason victory outside san###diego city###limits since . for buffalo coach jeff###quinn , the turnovers were too much to overcome . i 've always said , you 've got to take great###care of the ball , and right then and there , it turned into a three score###difference , he said . it was a very disappointing###loss today . buffalo , 6 2 mid###american###conference , playing in its second bowl###game in the team 's 100 year history , also was hobbled by an offense that took too long to get rolling and a defense that failed to create its own turnovers . the bulls did n't get their first first down until the 42 mark in the second quarter . they pulled to 14 10 late in the second quarter when patrick clarke kicked a 38 yard###field###goal . but the defense , led by mac defensive###player of the year kahlil mack , did n't have an answer for muema and the aztecs on the following possession . san###diego###state marched 67 yards in five plays and scored when muema sped around left###end from 8 yards out . moments later , licata threw his only interception . in that situation , i took a risk i should n't have taken . that 's all on me , said licata , who was 13 of 30 for 196 yards and was sacked four times . bulls running back branden oliver had for 114 yards on 28 carries , but the rest of the offense only managed 309 total###yards . mack , who was the focus of san###diego###state 's game plan , had just six tackles , as the aztecs ran the other way or double teamed him throughout . the bulls came into the game with a plus . 3 turnover margin , among the best in the nation . mack recovered a fumble near midfield in the first quarter , but the offense could n't capitalize against a defense that pressured licata and bottled up oliver early . san###diego###state started the season with three straight###losses , but showed throughout an ability to overcome adversity . three wins came in overtime and the aztecs came from behind in the fourth###quarter to win games . on saturday , they did n't need any late game drama and heroics . guys decided tonight we were going to play up to our abilities and it showed , aztecs safety nat berhe said . it 's kind of sad we did n't###play like that all year . but at the same time , i 'm glad it happened today .
denver the colorado###rockies signed pitcher jonathan gray on wednesday and then put up their top draft###pick in a luxury###suite to watch a game at coors###field . gray , selected third overall last week out of oklahoma , arrived in denver on tuesday and the sides completed the contract a day later . he attended a news conference at the ballpark before colorado played the washington###nationals , shook###hands with star shortstop troy tulowitzki and in the middle of the third inning was introduced to the crowd on the video board , answering a rousing welcome with a smile and a wave . pretty crazy , gray said . it still has n't hit me yet . gray said he was glad the deal was done so he could turn his attention to beginning his professional career . he is the highest 2013 draft###pick to sign so far the right hander was chosen after stanford pitcher mark appel ( houston###astros ) and san###diego third baseman kris###bryant ( chicago###cubs . it feels great . a huge relief , and i 'm ready as soon as possible to go out and play , gray said . he will join the rockies' rookie###league team in grand###junction . baseball###america reported that gray received a.8 million signing###bonus , below the assigned slot value of about . 6 million but still a record for the rockies . their previous high was . 9 million given to left hander tyler matzek in . a power###pitcher whose fastball clocks consistently in the mid to upper 90s ( mph ) and has occasionally hit 100 mph , gray was an appealing pick for the rockies . though he probably wo n't pitch at coors###field for some time , he said he 's well aware of its reputation as a hitter 's paradise . i hear the ball flies here , gray said . it 's not a pitcher friendly ballpark . but that 's something i 'll learn to overcome . as i work through the system , i 'll be able to do that . he certainly has shown plenty of promise . as a junior this season , gray went 10 3 with a . 64 era and 147 strikeouts in 126 1 3 innings . he was a first team all american and a unanimous all big 12 conference selection . jonathan has a power arm and he is a great competitor , bill schmidt , colorado 's vice###president of scouting , said last week after the club picked gray . jonathan is a good kid who we feel has a chance to be a quality starting major###league pitcher . in the days before the draft , published###reports cited unidentified sources who said gray tested###positive for the medication adderall during baseball 's predraft drug testing###program . gray and the rockies have declined to comment . a native of shawnee , okla . , gray was drafted by kansas###city in 2010 ( 13th round ) and the new york yankees in 2011 ( 10th round , but was n't###ready to sign and went to school instead . he attended eastern oklahoma state college in 2011 going 6 2 with a . 89 era before transferring to oklahoma in . gray said he kept working on his craft , polishing his pitching skills in hopes of improving his stock . i kind of took that as a challenge , he said . i knew i could put myself somewhere in the top picks if i just applied everything and worked toward that . now that it 's done , i feel great about it . i do n't think there 's a place i could feel better in , gray said .
continued global###warming poses a risk of rapid , drastic changes in some human and natural###systems , a scientific panel warned tuesday , citing the possible collapse of polar sea###ice , the potential for a mass###extinction of plant and animal life and the threat of immense dead###zones in the ocean . at the same time , some worst###case fears about climate###change that have entered the popular###imagination can be ruled out as unlikely , at least over the next century , the panel found . these include a sudden belch of methane from the ocean or the arctic that would fry the planet , as well as a shutdown of the heat circulation in the atlantic###ocean that would chill nearby###land areas the fear on which the 2004 movie the day after tomorrow was loosely based . in a report released tuesday , the panel appointed by the national###research###council called for the creation of an early###warning system to alert society well in advance to changes capable of producing chaos . nasty climate surprises have occurred already , and more seem inevitable , perhaps within decades , panel members warned . but , they said , little has been done to prepare . the reality is that the climate is changing , said james w . c . white , a paleoclimatologist at the university###of###colorado###boulder who headed the committee on abrupt impacts###of###climate###change . it 's going to continue to happen , and it 's going to be part of everyday###life for centuries to come perhaps longer than that . while most climate scientists believe the human release of greenhouse###gases has made immense changes in the earth inevitable , they hope many of these will happen slowly enough that society can adapt . the document the panel released tuesday is the latest in a string of reports to consider whether some changes could occur so suddenly as to produce profound social or environmental###stress , even collapse . like previous###reports , the new one considers many potential possibilities and dismisses most of them as unlikely at least in the near term . but some of the risks are real , the panel found , and in several cases have happened already . it cited the outbreak of mountain pine beetles in the american west and in canada . the disappearance of bitterly###cold winter###nights that used to kill off the beetles has allowed them to ravage tens###of###millions of acres of forests , damage so severe it can be seen from space . likewise , a drastic decline of summer sea###ice in the arctic has occurred much faster than scientists expected . the panel warned that arctic sea###ice could disappear in the summer within several decades , with severe impacts on wildlife and human communities in the region , and unknown effects on the world 's weather###patterns . among the greatest risks in coming###years , the panel said , is that climate###change could greatly###increase the extinction rate of plants and animals , essentially provoking the sixth mass###extinction in the earth 's history . the panel said many of the world 's coral###reefs , a vital source of fish that feed millions of people , already seemed fated to die within decades . another risk , judged to be moderately likely over the coming century , is that rising heat in the upper ocean could result in reduced oxygen in the deep . the worst###case###scenario would be the creation of huge zones with too little oxygen for sea###creatures to survive , with unknown consequences for the overall ecology of the ocean , the panel said . it considered the possibility that a collapse of the west###antarctic###ice###sheet , believed to be especially vulnerable to a warming ocean , would greatly###increase the rate of sea###level###rise . it found that risk , in the near term , to be unknown but probably low . the national###research###council is a nonprofit group in washington that frequently oversees studies on major scientific###questions this study was commissioned by several government###agencies .
there was no shortage of technical###prowess during an american###ballet###theater matinee of le###corsaire at the metropolitan###opera###house in early###june . in the central roles , the russian stars natalia osipova and ivan vasiliev were earning thrilled bursts of applause for the height of their jumps and the speed of their multiple turns . then daniil simkin , as ali the slave , stepped proudly onstage and threw himself into a twisting , leg scissoring jump that seemed to defy physics and gravity . the audience screamed , but mr . simkin , who became a principal at ballet theater in november , was already doing it again . and again , with the deliberate clarity of someone demonstrating an elementary move . it 's called a 540 here i 'm not sure why , mr . simkin said after the performance , drinking###coffee and eating a sugary confection at a nearby starbucks . maybe i 'm turning 540 degrees ? mr . simkin , 25 , with his floppy blond###hair and boy###band looks , has been known for his virtuosity since he began###entering international ballet competitions at , eventually###winning top spots at the three of the most prestigious###events , in varna , bulgaria helsinki , finland and jackson , miss . he is a regular on the international gala circuit and has a pop star 's following on youtube , where he began to post videos well before most dancers knew the forum existed . despite all this , mr . simkin , who is on the short side , he says ) and boyishly slight of build , has often been considered a niche dancer , a nimble star without the gravitas of a major performer . it took four years after he joined ballet theater in 2008 as a soloist to be promoted###to###principal###dancer , and he has had to wait patiently for the prince roles in swan###lake , or the sleeping###beauty , in which he makes his debut on wednesday . i was definitely a bit worried about his size when i hired him , said kevin mckenzie , the artistic###director of ballet theater , in a telephone interview . he had such an obvious talent , but i did n't know if it would work or be a fit . women are n't the only ones in ballet who need to conform to body stereotypes . leading men are supposed to be tall , with long limbs and broad###shoulders . there is some reason for this expectation men have to lift and partner women , who are several inches###taller than their natural height when on point . but the issue is aesthetic as much as anything else smaller men may well have the requisite strength and possess every technical attribute and still find themselves confined to secondary roles , as mercutio instead of romeo , the bluebird instead of prince desir . mr . simkin is obviously used to confronting the issue . nobody is perfect everyone has to deal with something , he said , slightly wearily , when asked whether being small had frustrated him . of course there are people who prefer a statuesque big###guy onstage , and i 'm never going to be that dancer . my build is slight , i look young , i ca n't###dance with just anybody as a partner . but you want to work on your weaknesses , not start having complexes . mr . simkin 's dancing has a beauty of line and a spacious grace even in the most whiplash fast turns , he seems to have ample time to show the inner workings of each step . unlike most ballet###dancers , he did n't train at a professional###school , but studied only with his mother , olga aleksandrova , a former dancer with the novosibirsk and wiesbaden state ballets . he did n't have the culture of being in a group , sharing that focus , mr . mckenzie said . to be privately trained for most of your formative###years is an unusual###situation . i do n't think it was to his detriment , but when it 's all you , then suddenly all about a company , that 's hard . but daniil understood that . he is very intelligent . in conversation , that intelligence is clear . born in novosibirsk , siberia , to russian dancer parents , mr . simkin speaks several languages , reads widely and is fascinated by technology and social###media . on his web###site , an essays section covers###topics like twitter , branding for dancers and his obsession with anime . nowadays we have the possibility of connecting with the audience directly , he said . so many people think of ballet as old fashioned , but we , the new generation , are able to fix and change that .
washington the nfl players union has set up a system to provide safe rides for its members . the agreement with uber technologies allows players to use smartphone technology to connect to reliable drivers . in a statement released wednesday , the union says the partnership underscores the nflpa 's ongoing commitment to ensuring its members have access to safe , discreet and professional transportation when they need it . beginning this month , nfl players will be able to summon a ride in any of uber 's international###locations , including nearly 17 nfl cities and pro###bowl host honolulu . once a ride is requested via uber 's smartphone app , a ride will arrive within minutes . uber and the union will distribute personalized key###chain cards containing ride credits to every active nfl player . certainly the issue of player safety and community safety continues to lead us to find new and better ways to keep our players safe and members of the community safe , said nfl###players###association executive###director demaurice smith . we 've brought state of the art technology and marketing in this effort to keep the players and the community safe . in our world , we know discipline plays a part in changing behavior , but we really wanted to start this to look at doing a better job by treating it as a public###health and safety and responsibility challenge . we believe this partnership with uber meets that . by using the smartphone app , players will be able to summon a ride without having to make an actual phone call or give directions . a gps system is built into the program . many nfl teams have offered safe rides to their players for years and also provide###assistance from their security and player engagement departments . still , there have been problems . as smith pointed out , last december , the cowboys josh brent tested###positive for a blood###alcohol###level more than twice the legal###limit after the car he was driving crashed and killed teammate jerry###brown . brent , who has retired from football , could get 20 years in prison if convicted . the goal for us is to change behavior , smith said . currently in the united###states we have increased enforcement and penalties , there 's been increased focus ( on drunk###driving . last year , we had a tragic###accident in texas . there already are dramatic penalties far above what the commissioner can impose in the nfl .
two theoretical###physicists who suggested that an invisible ocean of energy suffusing space is responsible for the mass and diversity of the particles in the universe won the nobel###prize###in###physics on tuesday###morning . they are peter w . higgs , 84 , of the university of edinburgh in scotland , and fran###ois englert , 80 , of the universit###libre###de###bruxelles in belgium . the theory , elucidated in , sent physicists on a generation long search for a telltale particle known as the higgs###boson , popularly known ( though not among physicists ) as the god particle . the chase culminated last year with the discovery of this particle , which confers mass on other particles , at the large###hadron###collider at cern , in switzerland . dr . higgs and dr . englert will split a prize of . 2 million , to be awarded in stockholm on dec . 10 . you may imagine that this is not unpleasant , dr . englert said in an early###morning news conference . the royal###swedish###academy###of###sciences had not been able to contact dr . higgs , who had vowed he would not be available tuesday . a friend and fellow physicist , alan###walker , said in a phone###interview on tuesday###morning that dr . higgs , who does not use a cellphone or a computer , had gone off by himself for a few days without saying where , and that he would return friday . dr . higgs , he said , is a modest###man who likes his own company and the ability to come and go without a fuss . even before the announcement , he said , one journalist had invaded dr . higgs 's building looking for an interview . he was sent away with a flea in his ear , dr . walker said . in a statement released later by the university of edinburgh , dr . higgs pronounced himself overwhelmed , saying , i hope this recognition of fundamental###science will help raise###awareness of the value of blue###sky research . the prize had been expected ever since physicists working at the large###hadron###collider announced on july , 2012 , that they had discovered a particle matching the description of the higgs . thousands of particle physicists worked on the project , and for many of them the nobel is a crowning validation . fabiola gianotti , who led one of the teams at cern , the european###organization###for###nuclear###research , called the prize a great emotion and a great###satisfaction , adding that it was nice that the experiments were cited in the award . the young physicists are superexcited . the higgs was the last missing ingredient of the standard###model , a suite of equations that has ruled particle###physics for the last half###century , explaining everything from the smell of a rose to the ping when your computer boots up . according to this model , the universe brims with energy that acts like a cosmic molasses , imbuing the particles that move through it with mass , the way a bill moving through congress attracts riders and amendments , becoming more and more ponderous and controversial . without the higgs###field , many elementary###particles , like electrons , would be massless and would zip around at the speed of light . there would be no atoms and no us . for scientists , the discovery of the higgs ( as physicists call it ) affirmed the view of a cosmos ruled by laws of almost diamond like elegance and simplicity , but in which everything interesting like us is a result of lapses or flaws in that elegance . that is the view that emerged in a period of feverish and tangled progress after world###war###ii , in which the world 's physicists turned their energies from war to looking under the hood of nature , using the tools of quantum###field###theory . at the heart of this quest was an ancient idea , the concept of symmetry , and how it was present in the foundations of physics but hidden in the world as we experience it . in art and nature , something is symmetrical if it looks the same when you move it one way or another , like a snowflake rotated 60 degrees in science and math , a symmetry is something that does not change when you transform the system , like the length of an arrow when you turn it around or shoot it . in , the theorists chen###ning###yang and robert l . mills at the brookhaven###national###laboratory concluded that all fundamental###forces were the result of nature 's trying to maintain symmetries for example , the conservation of electric###charge in the case of electromagnetism , or the conservation of momentum and energy in the case of einstein 's gravity .
atlanta the zigzag of a chart tracking the career of a typical football coaching lifer tends to mirror the charts that record the long###term performance of the stock###market . for the coach , the line 's overall ascent is periodically interrupted by a flat line or a downturn , reflecting the inevitable firing or nonrenewal of a contract . a three dimensional graph and extra ink might be required for jeff###jagodzinski 's chart , which has wildly zigged here and zagged there after a peak when he was the head###coach at boston###college . he managed to be dismissed twice in 2009 at boston###college ( with the jets playing a role ) and as offensive###coordinator with the tampa###bay###buccaneers without even working a game in between . there are detours and there is driving off###the###grid , which was what jagodzinski ( pronounced jag ud zin skee ) did when he became a head###coach in the four team united###football###league and worked as an unpaid assistant at the upstart n.a.i.a . member ave###maria###university . jagodzinski has paddled back into the football mainstream this season , barely , as offensive###coordinator at georgia###state . the winless panthers would rate last among the 125 bowl###championship###series programs in the computer poll average , but they do not qualify for the rankings while they make the transition to the football###bowl###subdivision level . because coaches coach wherever someone will hand them a whistle , the coach universally known as jags stays in a rented home while his wife ( lisa jags ) and four of their five children live 450 miles south in tampa , fla . i do n't see myself doing anything else but this , he said . there is a lot more to go . jagodzinski , 50 , is undeterred by the bang###bang job###losses , preferring instead to focus on the joy of affecting young###men 's lives and on the experiences that football can provide . he has tossed out the first pitch at fenway###park flown in a black hawk helicopter become acquainted with business captains , including the atlanta###falcons' owner arthur###blank , a co founder of home###depot , when he worked with the team , and tom###monaghan , the founder of ave###maria and of domino 's pizza toiled as a green###bay###packers assistant at lambeau###field , which he never set foot upon while growing up in milwaukee because of ticket scarcity secured autographs on the same ball from the packers legends bart###starr and brett###favre and been pranked by favre , whom he coached , with a fake rat under a desk . like players floored by a pancake block , coaches climb to their feet after being flattened . jagodzinski 's first knockdown moment happened in , two years into a winning stint###as###head###coach at boston###college . jagodzinski accepted an invitation to interview for the position of head###coach with the jets , which troubled the college 's athletic###director , gene defilippo . when jagodzinski defied his boss and met with the jets , he was fired . worse for him , the jets opted for rex###ryan . without specifying how , jagodzinski said he would handle the situation differently today . ( his wife attributed the breakup to two competitive men stubbornly holding their ground . cooler heads should have prevailed , she said . ) steve###logan , a friend and a boston###college assistant at the time who coached with jagodzinski at three stops , recalled the episode as catastrophic for everybody involved . i think there would have been a long , successful###run there , said logan , who hosts a sports talk###radio show in raleigh , n.c . still , jagodzinski was promptly re employed , this time as the bucs' offensive###coordinator . lisa and the children had just arrived in tampa , settling into a house she had not seen until after jeff bought it , when he was ousted just before the final exhibition###game . details were sketchy . logan , who had accompanied jagodzinski to the bucs , attributed the fallout to staff reassignments that led to conflicts in offensive philosophies . coaches are experts at picking themselves up and dusting themselves off , logan said . coaches getting fired , even though it happens all the time it still scars you . it hurt jeff deeply . lisa jagodzinski called it devastating , because we had just come off the other one it was kind of a double whammy . in his first autumn as an adult without football , jagodzinski immersed himself in routine activities and a charitable endeavor . for once , his wife did not have to ferry the children to the coaches' offices on halloween night to show off their costumes to their late working father .
greer , s.c . for joerg klisch , hiring the first 60 workers to build heavy engines at his company 's new factory in south###carolina was easy . finding the next 60 was not so simple . it seemed like we had sucked up everybody who knew about diesel###engines , said mr . klisch , vice###president for north###american operations of tognum america . it was n't###working as we had planned . so mr . klisch did what he would have done back home in germany he set out to train them himself . working with five local###high###schools and a career###center in aiken###county , s.c . and a curriculum nearly identical to the one at the company 's headquarters in friedrichshafen tognum now has nine juniors and seniors enrolled in its apprenticeship program . inspired by a partnership between schools and industry that is seen as a key to germany 's advanced industrial capability and relatively low unemployment###rate , projects like the one at tognum are practically unheard of in the united###states . but experts in government and academia , along with those inside companies like bmw , which has its only american factory in south###carolina , say apprenticeships are a desperately###needed option for younger###workers who want decent paying###jobs , or increasingly , any job at all . and without more programs like the one at tognum , they maintain , the nascent recovery in american manufacturing will run out of steam for lack of qualified###workers . south###carolina offers a fantastic model for what we can do nationally , said ben olinsky , co author of a forthcoming report by the center###for###american###progress , a liberal washington research organization , recommending a vast expansion in apprenticeships . despite south###carolina 's progress and the public support for apprenticeships from president###obama , who cited the german model in his last state of the union address , these positions are becoming harder to find in other states . since , the number of apprentices has fallen by nearly 40 percent , according to the center###for###american###progress study . as a nation , over the course of the last couple of decades , we have regrettably and mistakenly devalued apprenticeships and training , said thomas e . perez , the secretary of labor . we need to change that , and you will hear the president talk a lot about it in the weeks and months###ahead . in november , the white###house announced a new 100 million grant###program aimed at advancing technical###training in high###schools . but veteran apprenticeship advocates say the obama administration has been slow to act . the results have not matched the rhetoric in terms of direct###funding for apprenticeships so far , said robert lerman , a professor of economics at american###university in washington . i 'm hoping for a new push . in germany , apprentices divide their time between classroom###training in a public vocational###school and practical###training at a company or small firm . some 330 types of apprenticeships are accredited by the government in berlin , including such jobs as hairdresser , roofer and automobile electronics specialist . about 60 percent of german high###school students go through some kind of apprenticeship program , which leads to a formal certificate in the chosen skill and often a permanent job at the company where the young###person trained . if there is a downside to the german system , it is that it can be inflexible , because a person trained in a specific###skill may find it difficult to switch vocations if demand shifts . in south###carolina , apprenticeships are mainly funded by employers , but the state introduced a four year , annual tax###credit of , 000 per position in 2007 that proved to be a boon for small to medium###size companies . the center###for###american###progress report recommends a similar credit nationwide that would rise to , 000 for apprentices under age . the emphasis on job###training has also been a major calling###card overseas for south###carolina officials , who lured bmw here two decades###ago and more recently persuaded france 's michelin and germany 's continental###tire to expand in the state . the european influence is huge , said brad neese , director of apprenticeship carolina , which links the state 's technical###college system with private###companies to help create specialized###programs . they are our strongest partners .
the wildcats , last season 's national###champions , will have to settle for trying to win the n.i.t . the wildcats are not the only southeastern###conference team passed over by the n.c.a.a . tournament selection###committee . alabama and tennessee also missed the cut the first time in 39 years that the wildcats , the crimson###tide and the volunteers were all left out of the n.c.a.a . tournament . kentucky ( 21 11 ) and alabama ( 21 12 ) are no . 1 seeds in the n.i.t. , along with southern###mississippi and virginia . the wildcats , who struggled to live up to lofty preseason expectations , went 4 4 in their final eight games without the freshman star nerlens###noel , whose season ended early because of a knee###injury . kentucky , which played in the last two final###fours under coach john###calipari , became the 20th defending###national###champion to be left out of the n.c.a.a . tournament field and the first since north###carolina in . tennessee ( 20 12 ) is a no . 2 seed . maryland , baylor and massachusetts are the other no . 2 seeds . the field also includes st . john 's and providence .
new york move over john###mcenroe and ivan###lendl , the new greatest###rivalry in tennis will be on display at arthur###ashe###stadium when world number one novak###djokovic meets number two rafa nadal for the u.s . open###title on monday . djokovic and nadal , who have been dominant over the last 15 slams , will be meeting for the 37th time in the championship showdown , surpassing mcenroe and lendl for the most clashes since tennis turned###professional 45 years###ago . a high###intensity , high energy , ball slugging battle should be in the offing between the spaniard and the serb , who have staged thrilling five setters this year in the french###open semi###finals and last year for the australian###open title . asked if he enjoyed###playing against djokovic , nadal answered with refreshing honesty . i prefer to play against another one , he said with a smile . but is what it is . talking about a final , i want to play against a player that i have more chances to win . but i played against him a lot of times . always we played very exciting matches . nadal beat djokovic 9 7 in the fifth set of their semi###final on his way to winning his eighth french###open and 12th career###grand###slam title . djokovic won their six hour war in the 2012 australian###open final and has since added a third australian title in a row to take his grand###slam haul to six . the rivalry between roger###federer and nadal had been the foremost grudge game in the sport in recent###years , but with the swiss grand###slam king fading from dominance , djokovic nadal has risen to hottest in tennis . nadal leads the series 21 15 and has won five of the last six , but his overall edge was largely built in the first half of the rivalry when he won 14 of their first 18 matches . the spaniard , who missed the u.s . open last year after being sidelined for seven months by a knee###injury , has come back with a brilliant 2013 campaign . after skipping the season 's first slam , the australian###open won by djokovic , nadal has registered nine tournament victories and been perfect this season on hard###courts , posting a 21 0 mark on the surface within a tour best match record of . it 's always the biggest###challenge that you can have in our sport now , djokovic said about facing nadal . he 's the ultimate competitor out there . he fights for every ball and he 's playing probably the best tennis that he ever played###on###hard###courts . he has n't lost a match on hard###court this year and we all knew that over the course of last six , seven , eight years , hard###court has n't been his favorite surface . he lost three matches this year . with no doubt , he 's the best player in the moment this year , no question about it . their flushing###meadows finals clash will be a rubber match of sorts for djokovic and nadal . the second seeded nadal won his only u.s . open in 2010 against djokovic . the top seeded serb won his only u.s . title the next year against the spaniard . monday 's winner will be the year 's only two time slam###champion of . the showdown will mark the 12th time in the past 15 grand###slams dating back to the 2010 french###open that either djokovic or nadal will claim the slam###title , with nadal having won six and djokovic five during the stretch . the marquee match up features players with 18 grand###slam###titles between them , the most in a u.s . open###final since pete###sampras ( 13 ) beat andre###agassi ( 7 ) for the 2002 crown . if both of us are playing at very good level , the match becomes great because we play long rallies , we bring our game to the limit , and becomes a very difficult match for both of us . when you are involved in these kind of matches , you feel special , the spaniard said . is true we already play a lot of important###matches for our career , so that makes that confrontation special . the 26 year old djokovic , competing in his third major final of the season and fourth###successive u.s . open###final , was not cowed by nadal 's recent run of success . he 's very confident , but you know , i know how to play him . hard###court is my most successful surface . i have played him already here twice in the finals . i know what i need to do .
when dr . hal dietz arrived at johns###hopkins###university in the 1980s , he became obsessed with helping###children with marfan###syndrome , a rare and often fatal disorder that can cause the aorta , the large blood###vessel that carries blood from the heart , to grow and grow until it bursts . nothing we were doing seemed to make a difference in their lives , he said . these doomed children had a distinctive look that clearly had a genetic basis . they were typically very tall and thin , with long arms , legs and fingers . they often had unusually flexible joints , flat###feet and teeth that were crowded in their mouth . i decided to study genetics with the sole incentive to identify the gene for marfan###syndrome and ultimately to understand the mechanism , said dr . dietz , now director of the william s . smilow center for marfan###syndrome research at johns###hopkins . that journey has led to surprising discoveries about marfan 's causes and a soon to be published clinical###trial of a drug that may help its sufferers . dr . dietz 's work also inspired research that may lead to a blood###test that detects enlarged aortas , potentially saving thousands of lives , even among those who do not have marfan###syndrome . every year about , 000 americans die from ruptured aortas two victims were the actor john###ritter and the diplomat richard c . holbrooke . the hope is that such a test will allow doctors to operate before the aorta bursts , or to quickly###identify aortas that have ruptured so surgery can be performed without delay . time is of the essence . patients whose aortas are breaking apart all need immediate treatment , said dr . scott a . lemaire , a professor of surgery and of molecular physiology and biophysics at the baylor###college###of###medicine . the longer you delay the diagnosis , the greater the chance their aorta will rupture while you are trying to figure out what is going on . for families who have recently learned that a child has marfan###syndrome , dr . dietz 's discoveries and the clinical###trial he designed have divided their world into before and after , dread and hope . daniel speck of knoxville , md . , was given a diagnosis of marfan six years###ago , when he was , after his pediatrician noticed his spine was curved and suggested a test for scoliosis . it turned out that the curvature was caused by marfan###syndrome . we were blindsided , said his mother , amy speck . daniel was furious when he could n't###play basketball anymore . by then , dr . dietz and his colleagues had finally found the gene mutation that causes marfan . it had been a slow and frustrating process the sequencing machines now used to quickly map dna had not been invented . researchers had to sort through every gene in large###regions of dna shared by members of families in which someone had the syndrome . yet when the researchers first found the mutation , in , it seemed to lead to a dead###end . the mutation was in fibrillin , a protein in connective###tissue , suggesting that the tissue was falling apart because its molecular rivets did not work . and if that was true , dr . dietz said , there was nothing you could do to alter the course of the disease . or as dr . david altshuler of the broad###institute of harvard and m.i.t. , who was not part of the research team , put it , how can we fix the rivets when every rivet in the body is broken ? those were the dark###days of marfan research , dr . dietz said . but then he began to question the rivet hypothesis . it did not explain some of marfan 's most notable###features the strikingly long bones of the children 's arms , legs and fingers , their deeply set eyes that slanted downward , their flat cheekbones , small chins , extremely###low muscle###mass and small amount of body###fat . about 10 years###ago , he and his colleagues discovered the answer in another protein , t.g.f . beta , short for transforming###growth###factor###beta , which tells cells how to behave during development and is used in repairing wounds . the protein 's function depends on fibrillin , the very protein that is altered in marfan###syndrome . normally , fibrillin 1 hooks t.g.f . beta to connective###tissue . but in someone with marfan , the researchers###discovered , the fibrillin 1 is defective , and the process goes awry . instead of attaching to the connective###tissue , t.g.f . beta drifts away from it . floating free in the bloodstream , it makes cells behave abnormally , leading to many of the problems caused by marfan , including excessive growth of the aorta . in short , the rivet model was entirely wrong . that , dr . dietz said , was one of the few 'aha' moments in my life . he tested his theory in mice , giving them the mutated fibrillin 1 gene . sure enough , levels of the t.g.f . protein were very high . the mice showed marfan symptoms , including emphysema , weak skeletal###muscles and a thickening of the mitral###valve in the heart . he sought a way to block the function of t.g.f . beta and found a widely used blood###pressure drug , losartan , that did just that . in the mice , the drug prevented features of the syndrome , including ballooning of the aorta . instead of dying of aortic###aneurysms by three months of age , the mice lived a normal life###span of two years . in , the national heart , lung , and blood institute started a randomized trial based on dr . dietz 's work in which some children with marfan got the drug and others got the standard treatment , with a beta###blocker that slows the heart###rate . but dr . dietz worried about the children who were most severely###affected . most died in the first few years of life . by the time he finished the clinical###trial , they would be dead . they had an unrelenting growth of the aorta , he said . if the drug worked , it could save their lives immediately . i felt###compelled to treat them . one morning in , kari dostalik of urbandale , iowa , whose daughter , haley , has the disorder , went to a lecture by dr . dietz at the annual marfan###syndrome conference . he showed a slide of a boy who had a severe###form of marfan and had been given losartan outside the clinical###trial . ms . dostalik had met the child and his family at a previous conference . before treatment , the boy looked weak and tired . but after having taken the drug , she said , he was grinning ear to ear . even better , dr . dietz told the group , as soon as the boy and other children took the drug , their aortas stopped###growing . and losartan appeared to reverse some of the disease 's effects . when we heard the word 'reversed , ' ms . dostalik said , our first gut reaction was , 'how soon can we get haley enrolled ? ' the study was just beginning , and children would be in it for three years . neither the families nor the doctors would know which drug they were taking , losartan or the beta###blocker .
new york miguel###cabrera and the hard hitting tigers were too much for daisuke###matsuzaka in his return to the majors . cabrera hit a three run homer , torii###hunter also connected and detroit tagged matsuzaka early in his mets debut to beat new york 6 1 on friday###night . when i used to catch him in boston , he had a little more on it , tigers slugger victor###martinez said . today i think his ball was pretty straight . he left a few pitches up in the zone , and the big guys did n't###miss . hunter added a long rbi double and doug###fister ( 11 6 ) pitched into the seventh###inning to help detroit win the interleague series opener . austin###jackson went deep for the second straight day for the al###central leaders , back in new york after dropping two of three at yankee###stadium two weeks###ago . the series resumes saturday###afternoon with a rematch of all star game starters at citi###field max###scherzer puts his 18 1 record on the line against new york ace matt###harvey in a nationally###televised###game . you ca n't###beat that matchup , hunter said . if you blink you 're going to miss something . the mets said it 's the first time all star game starters will square off in a regular###season###game during the same season , according to research by the elias###sports###bureau . i figure this place will be hopping pretty good , tigers manager jim###leyland said . it should be fun . minus two injured starters , the mets signed matsuzaka on thursday to fill a hole in the rotation and immediately handed him a difficult assignment . led by cabrera and prince###fielder , the tigers began the night leading the majors in batting###average and second in runs . the right hander from japan , a former red###sox star who had been pitching in cleveland 's farm system , got off to a promising###start . working on three days' rest and wearing no . 16 , he threw a called third strike past jackson and was ahead 0 2 on hunter when the five time all star sent a booming drive far beyond the left###field###fence . cabrera and fielder followed with singles , but dice k prevented further damage . he was n't as fortunate in the second . omar###infante led off with an infield single and jackson walked with two outs . hunter hit a ground###rule###double that bounced over the 408 sign in straightaway center###field to put the tigers up . cabrera crushed the next pitch , a 91 mph fastball that he sent soaring just inside the left###field foul###pole for his 41 st home###run . i was thinking about how i wanted to pitch him from before the game , but it was hard to figure it out until you face him , matsuzaka said through a translator . i do n't think it was a bad pitch , but he hit a home###run off it . chasing his second consecutive al triple###crown , cabrera has comfortable leads in batting###average and rbis . he moved within five home###runs of baltimore slugger chris###davis . it 's just unbelievable , fister said , then changed his tune . it 's no longer unbelievable . it 's definitely believable , and he 's doing it for a long time in a row now . working with rookie travis###d'arnaud , catching his fifth major###league game , matsuzaka settled in from there and did not allow another baserunner . he retired his final 10 batters and was charged with five runs on six hits over five innings . i thought the last three innings he was very , very good , mets manager terry###collins said . the arm issues have caused his velocity to go down a little bit . but i tell you what , his breaking stuff is still very good . i was happy with the way he finished up . jackson added a solo shot in the seventh off reliever carlos###torres , originally###scheduled to start the game before the mets signed matsuzaka ( 0 1 ) for the remainder of this season . the red###sox shelled out more than 100 million to import matsuzaka in . he won 33 games and a world###series###ring during his first two years in the majors , but injuries and poor###performances followed . he had tommy###john###surgery on his pitching elbow in . matsuzaka went 1 7 with an . 28 era in 11 starts for boston last season and was beaten out by scott###kazmir for the final spot in cleveland 's rotation this spring . the 32 year old pitcher agreed to go to triple a columbus , where he was 5 8 with a . 92 era in 19 starts . after working through early###season injuries , matsuzaka had been effective in recent weeks . he was granted his release by the indians on tuesday , and the third place mets decided he was their best option to fill a void the rest of the way . i just kind of studied his old video and went off that , hunter said . fister gave up only an rbi single to marlon###byrd in the first . the big right hander induced two double plays and allowed eight hits in 6 1 3 innings before three relievers finished up . notes martinez , normally a dh , made his first start at catcher for detroit since aug . 4 , 2011 . it felt great all around , he said . ... the tigers said c alex###avila left his rehab game thursday with triple a toledo after three innings due to dizziness . avila is on the disabled###list with concussion symptoms . ... fister was 0 1 in his previous three starts after winning four in a row . ... collins said he wears no . 10 in grateful tribute to leyland and credited the detroit skipper with being a mentor . leyland gave collins his first big###league coaching###job in 1992 with pittsburgh .
the tumbling nets lost again , but this time , at least , the defeat came through bizarrely entertaining means . the nets fell behind by 27 points during a disastrous first half , and fans at barclays###center were soon chatting away , losing interest , as if watching some unknown opening act at a concert . gradually , the nets awakened , catalyzed by mirza teletovic , a scarcely used reserve forward , who scored a career###high 17 points to put them on the verge of an unthinkable win . and then came a shadowy incident involving a dark liquid . after all this , the brooklyn crowd was pulsating , primed for a cathartic burst . instead , the nets slumped to a 99 94 loss against the los###angeles###lakers , watching their record spiral further , to . the lakers came out , and they hit us right off the bat , coach jason###kidd said . but the guys kept fighting . teletovic scored 14 points in the fourth###quarter , and alan anderson dunked with . 8 seconds remaining to cut the lakers' lead to . but it appeared that the nets would require some type of supernatural intervention to prevail and kidd seemed to take it upon himself to provide it in sketchy , if admirably clever , means . with . 3 seconds###left on the clock , jodie###meeks sank his first of two free throws , pushing the lakers' lead to . as meeks was preparing to shoot his second free###throw , tyshawn###taylor and kidd collided clumsily near the nets' bench , and a drink tumbled from kidd 's hands and onto the floor . the game was paused for several seconds while the liquid was wiped up , and during that time the assistant###coach john welch sketched out a final play for the nets , who had no timeouts left . it seemed too fortuitous to be true and perhaps it was . television###replays appeared to show kidd mouthing the phrase hit me , before averting his eyes and running into taylor . after the game , kidd blamed the commotion around the bench as he scrambled to try to substitute players into the game . sweaty palms , kidd said . i was never good with the ball . taylor , too , denied there was any gamesmanship though he did acknowledge the possible helpful ramifications . it might ice a free###throw shooter and be a timeout when you do n't have one , taylor said . but that was n't the thought###process . taylor laughed and added he was just in my way . 'coach , get out of my way , bro ! ' after meeks made his second free###throw , paul###pierce came off a screen with . 2 seconds###left and had an open look at a potential###game###tying 3 pointer . but it missed , foiling kidd 's apparent gambit . the nets were in that position thanks to teletovic , who exceeded 20 minutes on the floor for just the second time this season and added five rebounds , two assists , a steal and a block to his career###high point###total . i can really do much more things than just shoot 3 pointers , said teletovic , who sank four of them . this is what we need , and this is what i try to bring every night , as much as i can . the nets outscored the lakers , 28 23 , during the third quarter , which augured well for the home###team . entering wednesday , the nets had won all four games in which they had outscored their opponents during the third quarter and lost all 10 times they were outscored . but the trend did not hold up wednesday . the lakers extended their winning###streak against the nets to 11 games . the understaffed lakers playing without kobe###bryant and steve###nash have survived this season on 3 point shooting , and it was an ominous sign for the lifeless nets when the lakers opened the game hitting their first three attempts from beyond the arc . the lakers' dominance bled seamlessly into the second quarter . they went up as much as 27 points though the nets did engineer a 15 0 run that helped them cut the deficit to 14 points entering halftime . the nets' immediate future remains murky . they are playing short handed , missing four key players , and there has been little indication about when they might return . they 're day to day , kidd said before the game , using words he has repeated almost indiscriminately this season . these are injuries that , they can come back anytime . so we just take it day by day , and we 'll see how they feel tomorrow . brook###lopez missed his seventh###consecutive game and deron###williams his fourth both players are battling sprained left ankles . the nets were also without the backups jason###terry , who missed his fourth###straight game with a sore left knee , and andrei###kirilenko , who skipped his ninth###consecutive game with a sore back . without them , the nets pulled out all the stops , some shadier than others , and got a stirring game from a rarely used reserve , but still fell short on a wild night .
washington coming off one of his worst outings of the season , washington starter jordan###zimmermann surrendered a pair of first inning hits against colorado on thursday###night . that only gave the rockies false hopes . zimmermann pitched eight innings to win his 10th game , adam###laroche had three hits including a two run triple and the nationals spoiled roy###oswalt 's return to the majors with a 5 1 win over the colorado on thursday###night . ian###desmond homered for the second straight game and denard###span and steve lombardozzi added a double and a single apiece for washington , which began a stretch in which it will play 14 of its next 17 games at home . what a game he pitched . we needed it , nationals manager davey###johnson said of zimmermann . ( after an ) 11 inning###game last night , that was a godsend . zimmermann ( 10 3 ) allowed an unearned###run on six hits , returning to form after surrendering six runs and eight hits in five innings saturday in cleveland . i felt like i threw the ball well and had good fastball command , my slider was good and i got a big strikeout in the last inning there on a changeup , zimmermann said . i was throwing strikes and getting ahead of guys . i know they 're an aggressive team and that kind of works in my favor . throw some first pitch strikes and let them hit the ball . zimmermann retired 16 straight in one stretch , throwing 112 pitches 85 for strikes while fanning nine and walking one . colorado finally got to zimmermann in the eighth . pinch###hitter josh rutledge singled , anthony###rendon committed a throwing###error after fielding tyler colvin 's grounder and rutledge ended up on third . dj lemahieu singled to score rutledge , but zimmermann struck out carlos gonzalez on a changeup and michael###cuddyer to end the threat . he 's starting throwing it more often , he started to get more confidence and now it 's a pretty good pitch , catcher kurt###suzuki said of zimmermann 's changeup . oswalt ( 0 1 ) went five innings in his colorado debut , allowing four runs on nine hits . he struck out 11 and did n't###walk a batter . i felt strong , oswalt said . overall felt pretty well , just , it 's hard to say this , but really too many strikeouts . kind of got my pitch###count up and i was trying to get deeper into the game . the 35 year old right hander was signed to a minor###league contract may , and went 3 2 with a . 16 era in five starts for double a tulsa before being called up . i thought roy threw the ball extremely well , punched out 11 in five innings , colorado manager walt###weiss said . plenty of stuff , plenty of arm , a really good fastball . i thought he had a few tough breaks , the line could have been better than what it showed . todd###helton and lemahieu had two hits for the rockies , who have lost the first four games of a nine game road trip and fell to . 500 for the first time since april . desmond , who hit a grand###slam in the 11th inning of wednesday 's 6 2 win at philadelphia , homered his first time up thursday###night to put washington ahead 1 0 after two . laroche led off the washington fourth with a single . after oswalt fanned jayson###werth and desmond , lombardozzi singled . kurt###suzuki then hit a grounder between third and short that shortstop jonathan herrera managed to deflect . herrera retrieved the ball in short left , but laroche raced around from second and was safe on a close play at home to make it . that feels good , when you 've been lining out at people to get a hit like that feels nice , suzuki said . laroche provided some insurance in the fifth when he tripled with one out , scoring span and rendon . zimmermann drove in the nationals' fifth run with a sacrifice###fly the first of his career in the sixth . washington , which began play second in the nl###east , won its second straight and picked up a game on division leader atlanta . obviously it 's nice to pick up a game , laroche said . we need to get ourselves on track and play some consistent ball . i do n't need to tell you we 've been way too streaky . notes johnson said before the game that of bryce###harper ( left knee bursitis ) ran in the outfield thursday and was going to take swings in the indoor batting###cage as he nears a rehabilitation###assignment . he 's close , johnson said . if it does n't swell up tomorrow , as far as i 'm concerned , he can play some . . cuddyer extended his hitting###streak to 18 games . ... washington of roger bernadina , who missed wednesday 's game with eye###irritation , entered the game in the ninth . ... to make room for oswalt , the rockies optioned lhp jeff###francis to triple a colorado###springs and designated rhp chris###volstad , who was at colorado###springs , for assignment . rockie cf dexter###fowler ( right ring###finger ) missed his third straight game . ... colorado rhp tyler chatwood , 2 . 33 ) opposes stephen###strasburg , 2 . 50 ) friday .
new york rafael###nadal laughed when asked if his serve was reaching the level it was at in , when he got broken a grand total of twice over his first six matches en###route to his only u.s . open###title . no , i do n't think so , he said . maybe not , but it 's certainly been good enough to make his first two matches of 2013 at flushing###meadows a breeze . nadal saved the only break###point against him thursday###night in a , 6 1 , 6 0 rout over qualifier rogerio dutra silva . he 'll head into the third round still not having lost his serve in the tournament and still undefeated on hard###courts , at , this season . in montreal , cincinnati , i was able to serve well , to lose very few serves , he said about the tune up events he won before heading to new york . so , important###thing is try to find a regular serve that gives me the confidence and that gives me the possibility to start a lot of points with an advantage . dutra silva 's lone break###point came in the second game of the second set . nadal took him off the court with a wide serve to his backhand that the brazilian put back into the net . nadal won the next two points to close out the first of 12 straight###games he captured to close the match . he was on court a total of 1 hour , 32 minutes . dutra silva 's road to the second round of this , his ninth career###grand###slam match , caught nadal 's eye . the 134th ranked brazilian won a third set###tiebreaker in his final qualifying###match , then saved seven match###points in his first round###match against vasek###pospisil before pulling it out in a , fifth set###tiebreaker . he made nadal work for it for the first half###hour or so , but eventually the 12 time major champion wore him down . next up for nadal , a third round###match against ivan###dodig , who won their only previous matchup on hard###court , pulling out back to back tiebreakers in 2011 in montreal . he 's a very aggressive opponent , good serve , very good backhand , he goes to the net , nadal said . he 's a tough one . i need to be playing my best if i want to have chances against him .
test###tube burger the times 's henry fountain reports on one researcher 's quest to show the world that meat does n't have to come from the farm . maastricht , the netherlands as a gastronomic delicacy , the five ounce hamburger that mark post has painstakingly created here surely will not turn any heads . but dr . post is hoping that it will change some minds . the hamburger , assembled from tiny bits of beef muscle###tissue grown in a laboratory and to be cooked and eaten at an event in london , perhaps in a few weeks , is meant to show the world including potential sources of research funds that so called in vitro meat , or cultured###meat , is a reality . let 's make a proof of concept , and change the discussion from 'this is never going to work' to , 'well , we actually showed that it works , but now we need to get funding and work on it , ' dr . post said in an interview last fall in his office at maastricht###university . down the hall , in a lab with incubators filled with clear###plastic containers holding a pinkish liquid , a technician was tending to the delicate task of growing the tens of billions of cells needed to make the burger , starting with a particular type of cell removed from cow necks obtained at a slaughterhouse . the idea of creating meat in a laboratory actual animal tissue , not a substitute made from soybeans or other protein sources has been around for decades . the arguments in favor of it are many , covering both animal###welfare and environmental###issues . a 2011 study in the journal environmental###science and technology , for example , showed that full scale production of cultured###meat could greatly###reduce water , land and energy use , and emissions of methane and other greenhouse###gases , compared with conventional raising and slaughtering of cattle or other livestock . those environmental arguments will only gain###strength , advocates say , as worldwide demand for meat increases with the rise of middle###class populations in china and elsewhere . dr . post , one of a handful of researchers in the field , has made strides in developing cultured###meat through the use of stem###cells precursor###cells that can turn into others that are specific to muscle , for example and techniques adapted from medical research for growing tissues###and###organs , a field known as tissue###engineering . ( indeed , dr . post , a physician , considers himself first and foremost a tissue engineer , and about four fifths of his time is dedicated to studying how to build blood###vessels . ) yet growing meat in the laboratory has proved###difficult and devilishly expensive . dr . post , who knows as much about the subject as anybody , has repeatedly postponed the hamburger cook off , which was originally###expected to take place in november . his burger consists of about , 000 thin strips of cultured muscle###tissue . dr . post , who has conducted some informal taste tests , said that even without any fat , the tissue tastes reasonably good . for the london event he plans to add only salt and pepper . but the meat is produced with materials including fetal calf serum , used as a medium in which to grow the cells that eventually would have to be replaced by similar###materials of non animal origin . and the burger was created at phenomenal cost , 000 euros , or about , 000 , provided by a donor who so far has remained###anonymous . large###scale manufacturing of cultured###meat that could sit side by side with conventional meat in a supermarket and compete with it in price is at the very least a long way off . this is still an early###stage technology , said neil stephens , a social###scientist at cardiff###university in wales who has long studied the development of what is also sometimes referred to as shmeat . there 's still a huge number of things they need to learn . there are also questions of safety though dr . post and others say cultured###meat should be as safe as , or safer than , conventional meat , and might even be made to be healthier and of the consumer appeal of a product that may bear little resemblance to a thick , juicy steak . this is something very new , dr . stephens said . people need to wrestle with the idea of whether this is meat or not .
it 's kind of a roster where you have to go player by player and evaluate each situation to see where they are at and see how strong they are , but we are excited about a roster for the gold###cup that really has a shot of winning it , klinsmann said in a statement . this tournament gives us a huge opportunity to see where a lot of the players are . even though we do n't have the european based players that were part of our world###cup qualifying###process , we put together the strongest###team possible for this huge opportunity at the gold###cup . perhaps the most notable player on the roster is landon###donovan , 31 , who has not played for klinsmann 's a team since august 2012 after taking a sabbatical from soccer over the winter . donovan has played in 28 gold###cup games and scored 13 goals , both national###team records . another national###team veteran , oguchi###onyewu , will return for the first time since june . thirteen on the roster play in leagues outside the united###states that are on summer###breaks . six of those damarcus###beasley , edgar castillo , joe corona , herculez###gomez , michael orozco fiscal and jose torres play in mexico . tijuana sends three players to the united###states team , as does real###salt###lake of major###league###soccer . two m.l.s . players defender corey###ashe and striker jack###mcinerney are seeking their first national###team cap . mcinerney is the league 's leading###goal###scorer with 10 goals . all of the tournament 's first round games are part of doubleheaders . the same goes for the quarterfinals ( in atlanta and baltimore ) and the semifinals ( in arlington , tex . ) . the final is scheduled to be played at soldier###field in chicago on july . the united###states begins play in the gold###cup with a game against belize in portland , ore . , on july . it will then play cuba in sandy , utah , on july 13 and close out the first round against costa###rica in east###hartford , conn . , on july . if the united###states finishes first or second in group c , it will advance to the quarterfinals at m t bank stadium in baltimore . mexico , which won the 2011 gold###cup , returned recently from the confederations###cup in brazil , where it represented concacaf . now , however , the sport 's regional governing###body has changed the format . the winners of the 2013 and 2015 tournament will engage in a playoff for the right to represent concacaf in the 2017 confederations###cup in russia . the roster ( m . l.s . unless otherwise noted
it was a momentous week for asteroids one that struck earth , and one that did n't . on friday###morning , people of the russian city of chelyabinsk looked up to see a bright object streak across the sky . about a minute later , they were buffeted by a thunderous shock###wave that shattered windows and caused hundreds of injuries . scientists used recordings of ultra###low frequency sound###waves to estimate that the asteroid that entered the atmosphere at , 000 miles###per###hour was 55 feet###wide , weighed , 000 tons , and released energy 30 times that of the atomic###bomb that destroyed hiroshima . astronomers had no chance of spotting the asteroid beforehand , because it came from the same direction as the rising###sun . an even larger asteroid , designated 2012 da , which astronomers had been diligently tracking , passed a close , but not too close , 17 , 200 miles from earth . the two , coming from different directions , were unrelated . the chemicals of modern###human civilization nitrogen fertilizers , artificial###sweeteners , prescription###drugs wash into bodies of water with unknown effects on wildlife . swedish scientists were curious about what a common anti anxiety drug , oxazepam , might be doing to wild european###perch . in the experiment , the fish became less anxious . they were more active , ate faster and had less regard for their fellow fish . such behavioral changes , if reflected in the wild , could alter the ecological balance . a less anxious perch might boldly venture out and get itself eaten by a predator . what are weather officials to do when a giant storm loses hurricane status just before it comes ashore ? that was the conundrum the national###hurricane###center faced in october as hurricane###sandy headed up the atlantic###coast . as forecast , the winds dropped below hurricane levels as the storm approached landfall . once it was classified as a post###tropical###cyclone , the center could no longer issue official advisories and passed the task to local###officials . in a report released last week , the center called on its parent agency , the national###oceanic###and###atmospheric###administration , to change the rules so that it could still issue advisories to emphasize the dangers of storm###surges even after the winds weaken slightly . a new way to seeit is not a bionic eye , but it is a first technological step to restoring vision for the blind . on thursday the food###and###drug###administration approved what amounts to an artificial retina special glasses that contain a camera and a video processor , which send###signals to a sheet of electrodes that have been implanted in the eyes . the electrodes send the signals to the brain . the treatment is the first to give sight to the blind , although only rudimentary aspects the outlines of objects and contrasts between light and dark . still , that is enough to enable at least some of the blind patients using the device to detect street crosswalks , the presence of people or cars , or even to read large type . a single gene mutation , 000 years###ago appears to help explain the distinctive###appearance of chinese , japanese , koreans and other east###asian people . scientists engineered mice with the east###asian version of this gene , called edar , and these mice indeed had thicker hair shafts characteristic of east###asians . to the surprise of the researchers , the genetically###engineered mice also had more sweat###glands . a chinese member of the research team tested people in china and found that they had more numerous sweat###glands than people elsewhere . the researchers said the mutation occurred in central china , where extra sweat###glands would have been a boon to the hunter###gatherers who lived in the warm , humid region . william###shatner may get to name a moon of pluto . in 2011 and , astronomers at the seti###institute in mountain###view , calif . , using the hubble###space###telescope , spotted two undiscovered bodies orbiting the former planet and designated them p4 and p5 the fourth and fifth known moons of pluto . the institute is inviting the public to vote on more permanent names in a poll at plutorocks . com . voting ends at noon on feb . 25 . in classical###mythology , pluto is the lord of the underworld , so the nine names proposed by the astronomers included styx ( the river that divides earth from the underworld ) and cerberus ( the three headed###dog guarding the gates to the underworld . mr . shatner , best known as capt . james t . kirk of star###trek , suggested vulcan and romulus , the names of fictional###worlds on the show romulus is taken ( it 's a moon around an asteroid , but the astronomers took him up on vulcan , adding that to the poll . of the more than , 500 ballots###cast as of monday###afternoon , vulcan led the tally with more than , 000 votes . after the polls close next monday , the astronomers will confer with the international###astronomical###union on the final names .
barcelona a three pronged investigation will take place into alleged state###aid for several la###liga clubs , including real###madrid and barcelona , the european###commission said on wednesday . athletic###bilbao are one of the teams alleged by a representative of several european clubs , in a complaint filed in , to have benefited from unfair tax advantages along with pamplona based osasuna and the world 's two richest clubs by income , real###madrid and barcelona . the four have privileges regarding corporation###tax as they are exempt from the general###obligation for professional###football###clubs to convert into limited sports companies . it means they have a preferential tax###rate of 25 percent compared to 30 percent . professional###football###clubs should finance their running###costs and investments with sound financial###management rather than at the expense of the taxpayer , read a statement from european###competition commissioner joaquin almunia . member states and public authorities must comply with eu rules on state###aid in this sector as in all economic###sectors . the european###commission added in wednesday 's news release that another line of enquiry will be into the controversial deal between the city of madrid and real where the club sold their training###ground for a considerable profit . land valued in 1998 at , 000 euros , 000 ) was later put at . 7 million###euros , the commission said . valencia , elche and hercules are also part of an investigation into financial###assistance they received from the regional###government in the form of loans and bank guarantees . on tuesday , spain 's secretary of state for sport , miguel cardenal , hit back at accusations the clubs were acting unfairly . the taxation for spanish clubs is a lot more burdensome , cardenal told radio nacional , comparing the system with other european###countries and saying it should be put into context . we are talking about entities , and i have up to date data , that they paid more than 170 million###euros last year , he said referring to the top flight la###liga clubs . i would like the commission , when it talks about a helping###hand in europe , so as not to give the wrong###impression , to explain that the taxation of spanish clubs is considerably more burdensome than their counterparts in germany , england and france with the law that they have in place , and including italy . spain 's economy minister luis de guindos said the government would happily cooperate with the commission 's investigation . i think that we will arrive at a satisfactory solution , he told###reporters in brussels , denying there was a conflict of interest for almunia , in charge of competition###policy for the commission , as a spaniard and athletic###bilbao fan . we have complete###confidence in the professionalism of almunia in the handling of decisions over competition .
in a chilling episode of homeland last year , a terrorist killed the vice###president with a fiendishly clever weapon a remote###control device that attacked the computerized defibrillator implanted in his chest . for former vice###president dick###cheney , it was all too realistic . mr . cheney , who had heart###disease for decades before receiving a transplant last year , had such an implant to regulate his heart###rate and shock his heart back into life , if necessary . the defibrillator could be reprogrammed wirelessly from a short###distance away . in , he had the wireless feature disabled . about the homeland scenario , mr . cheney said on the oct . 20 episode of 60 minutes i found it credible . it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible . but was it really ? medical###experts say the answers are surprisingly complicated . mr . cheney 's cardiologist , dr . jonathan reiner of george###washington###university , said in the 60 minutes interview that he agreed with his patient . an assassin on a rope line or in a hotel###room next door could have instructed the defibrillator to kill mr . cheney , he said , adding that a wireless programmable device seemed to me a bad###idea for the vice###president of the united###states . other experts say the scenario is highly unlikely , though they couch their answers carefully . the devices , used by millions of americans , transmit data from a patient 's home to a doctor 's office , alerting the doctor of a malfunction . but the communication goes only one way the devices being used today cannot be reprogrammed remotely . instead , patients must go to a doctor 's office . with some devices , they must be within inches of the reprogramming machine . others can be reprogrammed from about 30 feet away , but a wand must be held close to patients' collarbones to identify them to the machine . my opinion is it is probably unlikely that a remote attack of this nature could happen today , said kevin fu , a university of michigan expert on computer security . but he emphasized the word probably , adding that he would never say something is impossible . there can always be a flaw we are unaware of , he said . in fact , a precedent for the homeland episode was a 2008 paper by dr . fu and others , who reported they had managed to change the settings on an implantable defibrillator so it would release deadly electric###shocks . of course , dr . fu noted , the experiment required almost a dozen people in a lab full of ph . d.s . and investigators had to be as close as two inches from the defibrillator . still , the experiment became known as a proof of principle . it originated a decade###ago , when dr . fu noticed that the food###and###drug###administration had issued a recall for software on an implanted heart device . he began to wonder about software###updates and the security of medical###devices . so he started###calling cardiologists , trying to get more information . many hung up on him , dr . fu said , adding , they thought i was crazy to worry about the security of a device in the chest . finally , he got together with a colleague , tadayoshi kohno , a computer security researcher at the university of washington . the two investigators and their colleagues set to work seeing if they could breach the security of a defibrillator that had been removed from a patient 's chest . the defibrillator and the device used to program it communicated in their own language from a distance no greater than a few inches , dr . kohno said . the group figured out the language by turning various therapy commands on and off . after they learned the communication language , we could generate the commands ourselves . at that time , security was not on the radar yet for medical###devices , dr . fu said . but there was a rapid trend toward wireless###communication and internet###connectivity . we definitely raised###awareness . he immediately heard from the device industry group , the advanced###medical technology association , or advamed , which invited dr . fu and dr . kohno to speak to its pacemaker working###group , a small meeting where members discuss policy###issues . now , the device###manufacturers are acutely###aware of security issues , said bernie liebler , a director in the group 's technology and regulatory###affairs department . everyone runs a risk###management program , mr . liebler said . you look at what can go wrong , what are the risks , what are the harms , what is the probability , what is the severity .
london there would have been mutterings of i told you so among those who doubted arsenal 's ability to stay the course in the title race as manchester###city hit top gear on saturday . arsenal manager arsene wenger sought to pass a crushing 6 3 defeat off as a bad day at the office , without any knock on effects for what is to come in the title race . yet arsenal fans who have become used to seeing the wheels come off at various points of previous###seasons will be crossing fingers that it is not a sign they are about to suffer another damaging slump . it is not beyond a bad day , it is a bad day , wenger said on bt###sport . we conceded six goals , we lost our discipline at the end and were too open when i took ( mathieu ) flamini off . out of the six goals we gave them five and when we came back to , we had a chance but could not take it . they scored the goals and you cannot say they did not deserve them . we have to come back to reality and it 's about us defending together and we have not done that today . the result raised both eyebrows and temperatures at the etihad###stadium , with the final whistle prompting a verbal scuffle between per mertesacker and mesut ozil . arsenal 's two germany internationals came together for a bout of finger pointing seemingly due to ozil 's failure to applaud the travelling fans . as those fans boarded trains to head back to london , the topic of debate was likely to be whether it was a sign of things to come . it came on the back of a difficult week for wenger 's team , who also dropped points at home to everton last weekend and fell to a 2 0 defeat to napoli in the champions###league on wednesday that left facing a daunting draw in the last . in recent###seasons , periods of inconsistency have effectively###ended arsenal 's hopes of competing for silverware . last season they came unstuck between october and february , exiting every cup###competition they were in and dropping too far off the pace in the premier###league . defeat at home to chelsea next weekend would see them shunted off the top of the table . arsenal fell behind after just 14 minutes as sergio aguero met a flick on from martin demichelis at the far post , arched his back and with balletic agility flashed a waist###height volley into the back of the net for his 13th league###goal of the season . theo###walcott , making his first start since mid###september , side footed the leveler thanks to a slight deflection from demichelis , but alvaro negredo put city back ahead . the spaniard prodded home pablo###zabaleta 's cross from the right and fernandinho capitalized when arsenal gave away the ball at the back with a superb curling finish into the far corner to make it . walcott reduced the deficit with a curling effort , but david###silva sidefooted home a cross from the right to make it 4 2 and fernandinho added a fifth with a delicately chipped finish . after per mertesacker notched a consolation , yaya toure reconfirmed city 's dominance from the penalty###spot . if wenger was upset by his side opening the floodgates and conceding six , his city counterpart was disappointed that his team let in half that amount . to score six goals against arsenal , the best defense and best team , is good , but to concede three goals is too much and that is something that we need to improve , pellegrini said . we will always try to win the title . we have not had great results away from home but we are finding a style of play and we will try to continue a style of play . at the end of the year we will see who is the best team . the only worry for city was an injury to aguero who was forced off early in the second half . sergio will see the doctor , it appears a problem with his calf but i do n't know how many weeks .
but the fact is , the minimum###wage 's anti poverty powers have been declining steadily for decades . in the late 1960s , a full time job at minimum###wage could almost lift a family of four above the poverty###line . by the late '80s , it left them 40 percent below it . that is about where things stand###today . perhaps it is no wonder , then , that the minimum###wage is in the spotlight . low###paid workers across the nation are pressing for a raise . fast###food workers in particular many of whom earn little more than the . 25 an hour federal minimum are pushing for . senate democrats want to raise the minimum to . 10 over three years . at the center of the debate is economic###inequality , which has reached levels not seen since the gilded###age . poverty is at a two decade high . the share of poor working###age americans is the highest since at least , according to a new study by researchers at columbia###university . this sobering reality raises two questions . first , can the minimum###wage be raised significantly without prompting employers to dump workers , close franchises and replace cashiers with computers ? second , could the minimum###wage play a significant###role in mitigating poverty and , perhaps , slowing the widening gap in american incomes ? neither has an easy answer . perhaps the most compelling argument for raising the minimum###wage is simply this it is worth a try . it might not be the most effective tool to raise the incomes of the working###poor . but given the erosion of collective###bargaining and the absence of other labor market regulations , it is one of the few we have . economists disagree about whether raising the wage will cost some workers their jobs . a poll this year found top economists about evenly divided on whether a 9 minimum would make it noticeably harder for low skilled###workers to find a job . and some question whether a higher###minimum would really help the poor over all , since some workers would keep their jobs while others would lose them . it 's kind of a wash , said david neumark of the university of california , irvine . the hit to losers wipes out the gains for winners . he said the earned###income###tax###credit has proved much more effective at relieving poverty among families and , especially , children . back in the '80s , president###ronald###reagan 's top economists argued that the minimum###wage was a job killer . in , alan###greenspan , who had been appointed federal###reserve chairman by mr . reagan , told a congressional hearing i 'm not in favor of cutting anybody 's earnings or preventing them from rising , but i am against them losing their jobs because of artificial government###intervention , which is essentially what the minimum###wage is . in an interview more than 10 years###ago with rick wartzman , my former colleague at the wall###street###journal who now runs the drucker institute at claremont###graduate###university , murray weidenbaum , the chairman of mr . reagan 's first council###of###economic###advisers , said of the minimum###wage if we would have had our druthers , we would have eliminated it . the reagan###administration did n't abolish it . the political cost would have been too high . instead , it let inflation turn it , in mr . weidenbaum 's words , into an effective dead###letter . by the time the reagan years were over , the minimum###wage was worth less than two thirds of its peak value . nonetheless , the real poverty###rate after taking into account other government transfers to the poor was lower than it had been during the minimum###wage 's heyday in . for all the resistance , there is a compelling###case that the minimum###wage should probably rise and not because that would sharply reduce###poverty . it is because the united###states has little else to support the working###poor . the drawbacks are probably not as dire as critics have charged . recent###research , based on the experience of 11 states that have imposed their own , higher###rates , suggests that a modest increase to the minimum###wage has little or no adverse###impact on employment . the minimum###wage can complement the earned###income###tax###credit , which can depress wages because it creates new incentives to work , increasing the supply of workers who will accept a low wage . and it reaches parts of the population that the tax###credit does not touch , like many poor###men and women without children who would welcome a chance to work their way out of poverty . new research suggests that the minimum###wage may in fact slightly reduce###poverty . arindrajit dube of the university of massachusetts , amherst , estimates that a 10 percent increase in the minimum###wage would reduce the poverty###rate by about 2 percent and increase the income of people near poverty by about 2 to 3 percent . it might even slow the widening income###gap . some scholars have concluded that while the decline of the minimum###wage was probably not the main cause of growing inequality since the 1980s , it did play a role in widening parts of the income###gap . these effects are , admittedly , not enormous . but they are gains . and they are more than the labor market has been able to deliver . notably , arguments that more education will on its own improve the lot of workers at the bottom are belied by the fact that low###wage###workers today are more educated than they have ever been . the united###states might not even need a minimum###wage if it had some of the institutions that other advanced nations use to put a floor on workers' living###standards . but it does n't . at the end of the day , it is true that the united###states and its flexible labor markets produce more fast###food employment than those of other rich nations . mcdonald 's has one restaurant for every , 000 americans yet only one for every , 000 swedes . americans' unbridled love of burgers and fries , of course , plays an important###role . but another reason is pay swedish burger flippers earn more than their american###counterparts . that means the prices of burgers are more affordable to the average american than to the average swede . the smallness of the share of the low###skill , labor###intensive private service###sector in many european###countries relative to that in the united###states is at least to some extent due to their higher###price of low###skilled labor , wrote the economists robert lipsey from the national###bureau###of###economic###research , now deceased , and birgitta swedenborg of the center for business and policy###studies in stockholm , in a study a few years###ago about the price disparities . their high###prices inhibit not only the consumption of these services , but also their production and their employment of low###skill workers . keep two facts in mind . first , millions of fast###food jobs are not indispensable for prosperity . sweden may have fewer mcdonald 's outlets than the united###states , but almost twice the share of americans live in poverty . and second , the floor can be raised without a minimum###wage . sweden , in fact , does n't have one . but it does have other tools like a 70 percent unionization rate . in the united###states , the union membership rate in the private###sector is about 7 percent .
kansas###city , mo . hall of famers albert lewis and art still are among nine former kansas###city###chiefs players who have joined a lawsuit that contends the team hid the risks of permanent brain injuries from repeated concussions . the concussions happened between late 1987 and early 1993 when there was no nfl collective###bargaining###agreement in place . five former players filed the initial suit against the chiefs this month , saying the team ignored decades of scientific###research indicating repeated head###trauma causes permanent brain###damage . in the amended suit filed saturday in jackson county###circuit###court , the plaintiffs said arrowhead###stadium 's artificial surface contributed to the head injuries . also joining the lawsuit were dino hackett , todd mcnair , fred###jones , tim barnett , walker lee ashley , emile harry and chris###smith , along with the wives of several of them . ken mcclain , a lawyer whose firm is representing the plaintiffs , said at least 10 more former chiefs could join the suit by before the end of the year . certainly , hall of famers who contributed###greatly to building the franchise add to the urgency for the team to find a just resolution , rather than try to ignore it or act like they had nothing to do with it , mcclain said . chiefs spokesman ted crews said the team had no comment . in recent###years , a string of former nfl players and other athletes who suffered concussions have been diagnosed after their deaths with chronic###traumatic###encephalopathy , or cte , including junior###seau and ray easterling , both of whom committed###suicide . in august , the nfl reached a tentative 765 million deal to settle lawsuits filed by more than , 500 former players who developed dementia or other concussion related###health###problems they say were caused by football . the settlement , subject to approval by a federal###judge in philadelphia , would apply to all past nfl players and spouses of those who are deceased . mcclain called the national settlement which does not include an admission from the nfl that it hid information from players about head injuries insignificant and said it provides compensation only to the former players with the most severe brain injuries . rather than protecting players who sustained concussions , the lawsuit said , the chiefs increased their risks by giving them ammonia inhalants , caffeine cocktails and or toradol to abbreviate the need for concussed employees to miss working time due to a brain###injury . toradol is an injectable , anti###inflammatory drug used short###term to treat moderate###to###severe pain . players were even more prone to head injuries because of the concrete like astroturf surface that was in place until , the lawsuit said . that surface made the players faster and was cheaper than maintaining a grass field , the plaintiffs said . because of the heightened violence of high###speed hits , the suit says , the game became more attractive to fans and increased the team 's revenue . missouri presented a unique###opportunity to file the lawsuit because a state workers' compensation statute was amended in 2005 to exclude cases of occupational injury that occur over an extended time . that exception more commonly applies in workplaces where smoking is allowed and workers suffer lung problems because of it . mcclain also represented workers at a jasper popcorn plant who were awarded millions###of###dollars in lawsuits . they contended they got cancer because of a chemical in butter flavoring used at the plant . former chiefs players leonard griffin , chris###martin , joe###phillips , alexander louis cooper and kevin porter were the initial plaintiffs in the suit .
the stock###market bounced back on tuesday from the previous day 's sell off as strong earnings reports continued to power gains and concerns about europe 's debt crisis eased . the dow###jones###industrial###average rose . 22 points , or . 71 percent , to close at , 979 . 30 , erasing a large part of its loss from monday . the dow traded above , 000 during the day before falling back in the last hour . the standard###poor 's 500 stock###index gained . 58 points , or . 04 percent , to , 511 . 29 . the nasdaq composite###index picked up . 41 points , or . 29 percent , to , 171 . 58 . the rise follows two days of whiplash . on monday , the dow dropped 129 points , its worst sell off of the year so far , as fears about europe 's finances resurfaced . on friday , the index gained 149 points , closing above , 000 for the first time since . the dow is now 185 points below the nominal record high of , 164 it reached on oct . 9 , 2007 . after strong gains for stocks this year , investors are wondering whether they should sell now , or wait and see if the rally still has legs , said brad reynolds , chief###investment###officer at ljpr . the market is extremely skittish right now , that 's why we 're seeing such big moves , mr . reynolds said . contributing to tuesday 's advance was new data showing that home###prices rose in december at the fastest pace in more than six years . corelogic , a real###estate data provider , reported that home###prices rose . 3 percent . in europe , a measure of manufacturing and service businesses rose to a 10 month high in january . est###e###lauder rose . 66 , or 6 percent , to . 71 after reporting earnings that beat analysts' expectations . profits surged 13 percent at the beauty products company as sales in the united###states and emerging###markets rose . computer sciences , an information###technology services company , was the biggest gainer in the s. p . 500 . computer sciences rose . 84 , or . 2 percent , to . 75 after the company said it was raising its earnings outlook for the year because its cost###cutting efforts were yielding better results than it had expected . stocks have gotten off to a strong start this year . the dow advanced . 8 percent in january , its best start to the year since , according to data compiled to s. p . dow###jones indexes . the s. p . 500 rose 5 percent last month . lance roberts , chief economist at streettalk advisors in houston , said that strength was related more to the federal###reserve 's commitment to keep money cheap than to companies' performance . if earnings are beating estimates , he said , it 's largely because expectations were so low . if you lower the hurdles enough , companies can get over them , mr . roberts said . the fact that individual###investors are starting to return to stocks , as they have in recent weeks , is another sign that the market is due for a correction , mr . roberts and other analysts have said . the mcgraw###hill companies , parent of the standard###poor 's ratings agency , fell . 38 , or . 7 percent , to . 92 , after the federal###government sued s. p . the government said that standard###poor 's knowingly misled investors about the quality of the mortgage###backed###securities it was rating in the run up to the financial###crisis that caused the recession . the stock dropped 14 percent on monday after early###reports about the lawsuit . traders sold bonds as they moved money into stocks . the price of the 10 year treasury note dropped , to , while its yield rose to . 01 percent from . 96 percent late monday . among other stocks on the move , kellogg gained 40 cents , or . 7 percent , to . 50 , after reporting fourth###quarter results . it booked a loss because of a pension related charge , but underlying earnings rose . dell , the struggling computer giant , rose 15 cents , or . 1 percent , to . 42 after the company announced a.4 billion buyout deal led by its founder , michael###dell , that will take the company private at . 65 a share . yum###brands , parent of kfc , pizza###hut and taco###bell , fell . 86 , or . 9 percent , to . 08 after the company warned late monday that 2013 profits could decline as it continues to reel from a controversy over its chicken suppliers in china .
the mayoral and city###council candidates in an iowa town who were most closely###aligned with the message promoted by americans for prosperity , the deep pocketed conservative political group , were roundly defeated on tuesday in a sharp rebuke of outside influence in local###politics . the group , founded by the billionaire brothers charles and david###koch , did not back specific candidates , but it targeted incumbents in the town , coralville , for their role in running up a 280 million debt . yet the involvement of an outside group provoked so much anger that the race became as much a referendum on the group 's involvement as on the issues themselves , and it captured national###attention , including from the white###house . vice###president joseph r . biden jr . called the newly###elected###mayor , john a . lundell , who was a city###council incumbent , on election night to congratulate him for overcoming the outside influence . if anything , people in coralville said , americans for prosperity 's efforts backfired and helped the candidates whose positions it was criticizing . the intrusion of the americans for prosperity pretty much poisoned the water of what we were trying to do for the last couple of years , said douglas paul , a member of citizens for responsible growth and taxation , a group made up mostly of area business###owners that also spoke out against the debt and the town 's economic###development strategy . although his group agreed with americans for prosperity on many of the issues , mr . paul said , their positions came off as frightening . they were pretty much like bringing a loose cannon into the room , mr . paul said . they pretty much were a benefit to the incumbents . all three incumbents who ran won . bill hoeft and thomas j . gill kept their seats on the five member council . ( only three seats were up for election . ) the one nonincumbent who won a seat on the council , laurie goodrich , was seen as having an outside shot she was a supporter of the current council and garnered much attention for a meeting she had with members of the citizens' group in which she said she was offered , 000 to run as its candidate , an allegation the group denies . during his celebration at a mexican restaurant in coralville on tuesday###night , mr . lundell said his cellphone buzzed with a number bearing the 202 area###code . the voice on the other end was mr . biden 's , and he said he could tell it was not a prank . ( a spokeswoman for the vice###president confirmed that he had called mr . lundell . ) he says that the coralville race has become a race they began following very carefully , mr . lundell said . the vice###president went on to congratulate him and the town , mr . lundell said , for stepping up against this well funded group , outside influence . mark j . lucas , the president of americans for prosperity 's iowa chapter , said he was pleased with his organization 's efforts in coralville it ran newspaper###ads , knocked on doors and mailed out fliers . he credited that work for drawing a record turnout , 820 people , or nearly a quarter of registered###voters in a town of fewer than , 000 people , and setting the conversation . i think all these people who got elected , they know that the deficit is now an issue , and people are talking about it , he said .
midland city , ala . many things hold little southern towns together . there is a common love of the region , the peace that comes with a rural###life and , often , prayer . in this town of , 300 in the heart of peanut country , people drew on all of those as they endured what by thursday###night had stretched into an unimaginable situation . a relative###newcomer to town a man who had fought in vietnam and appeared to harbor a deep###distrust of government and a grudge against every neighbor shot and killed a bus driver on tuesday , grabbed a 5 year old boy named ethan and then disappeared with the boy into a well equipped bunker he had spent several months digging in his yard . by all accounts , the man that neighbors and a sheriff 's office official identified as jimmy###lee dykes , 65 , had no connection to the boy . as far as we know , there is no relation at all , said michael senn , a pastor at the midway assembly of god church , who comforted some of the children who escaped from the bus and ran to his church . he just wanted a child for a hostage situation . like so many clerics in this bible reading community , mr . senn has been leading prayer services as the hours have stretched into days . by late thursday , no end was in sight . the f.b.i . stayed in contact with mr . dykes by day and let him sleep at night , said police###chief james arrington of pinckard , a nearby city . they 're taking time and trying to wear him out , he said . he may do harm if they try to rush him . we do n't know how much ammunition or bombs he has . mr . dykes , neighbors said , has been known to stay in his bunker for up to eight days . some said they watched him build it , carrying cinder blocks and digging for hours . no one is sure exactly why he took the boy . he do n't care too much for the government , chief arrington said . that 's all we know . the boy , whom his mother calls love bug , is reportedly doing well in the bunker , an alabama state senator , harri anne###smith , said in a television interview early thursday . she and state representative steve clouse have met with ethan 's mother , and said food and medication her son needed for autism was delivered to the bunker through a 60 foot plastic pipe that was about four inches###in###diameter . still , mr . clouse said , the family is just holding on by a thread . as it became clear that the standoff would continue the bunker was well supplied with food and , apparently , a television and lights the national###news###media began###arriving . through wednesday and into thursday , residents watched as their tiny###town , where the national peanut festival in nearby dothan is usually the biggest###event of the year , became a near constant presence on national###television . the killing of the bus driver and the resulting standoff soon became one more point of discussion in the national###debate about guns . many people here own guns and hunt and are steadfast in their belief that guns are not the problem , mental###health is . around town and along the entrance to the dirt###road where the bunker was sunk into mr . dykes 's land , people began arguing in favor of allowing bus drivers to carry###guns . i follow the old boy###scouts motto , 'be prepared , ' said james alexander , 72 , who said he sleeps with a gun by his pillow . i cannot foresee a way to prevent this without shooting the guy . although reporters were held across the highway from a red dirt###road that leads into a wooded###area with about a dozen houses , and there were no major developments to report on thursday , on television the story was regularly spliced between coverage of state and national hearings on gun###violence and mental###health prompted by the shootings in newtown , conn . , in december . it 's crazy , said tyler cobb , a high###school junior who was one of more than 90 students who met to pray for ethan on wednesday . it happened in connecticut . but it really hits home when it happens here . our little town on cnn . it 's just weird . prayer vigils sprung up like farm stands in the summer here . five were held wednesday , and on thursday members of a church youth###group gathered to pray across the highway from the road that leads to bunker . prayer took hold on social###media sites , too . a twitter call to pray for ethan gained steam . the bus driver , charles###albert poland jr . , 66 , encountered mr . dykes on the way home from school on tuesday . the bus stopped and mr . dykes jumped on , according to police reports based on interviews with children on the bus , and then he demanded two boys between the ages of 6 and . mr . poland held mr . dykes at the front of the bus while 21 children escaped out the back . he was hit with as many as four bullets from a 9 millimeter pistol . the well liked driver was quickly called a hero by residents . with the driver down , mr . dykes grabbed two children , the police said . one escaped . ethan may have frozen or fainted , allowing mr . dykes to take him swiftly from the bus . tim byrd , chief###investigator with the dale county###sheriff 's office , told the southern###poverty###law###center 's hatewatch blog that mr . dykes was a vietnam###veteran with post###traumatic###stress who did not trust the government . he was also scheduled to face###charges of menacing in court on wednesday after neighbors said that he shot a gun at them in a dispute over someone driving on his property . meanwhile , the community here did what small###communities do . it did not take long for churchgoers to start cooking , joining the salvation###army and the red###cross to feed more than 50 f.b.i . negotiators and law###enforcement###officers from at least eight agencies . everybody wants to help everybody is talking about the boy , said lisa boatwright , a secretary at a nearby church . but there 's only one thing we can do pray this ends safely .
washington president###obama met for more than an hour on capitol###hill with senate democrats on tuesday , engaging in a lengthy , detailed###discussion about potential changes to entitlements and other ways to balance the budget . the discussion was held on the first of three days of congressional outreach by mr . obama that will include meetings with both parties in the house and with senate republicans . mr . obama expressed###hope of reaching a grand bargain in the next few months , according to the senators at the meetingy , and said he was optimistic about an immigration bill . the president arrived at 30 p.m . and stayed until 45 p.m. , which was a half###hour longer than scheduled , largely because he was peppered with so many questions . while the tenor of the discussion was civil , several senators voiced concerns about cuts in popular programs like medicare and social###security , according to people at the meeting . he clearly shares our concern that we 're not going to do this deal on the backs of needy medicare and social###security recipients , said senator christopher s . murphy , democrat of connecticut . the president was pretty clear that there are pieces of social###security that he 's willing to talk about , but he 's going to need some give from republicans . mr . obama has signaled a willingness to reduce###costs in social###security by changing the way cost of living increases are calculated a formula opposed by many democrats . but he also reiterated that he is demanding billions in additional tax revenue . we need to keep that safety net there for our seniors , said senator jon###tester , democrat of montana . still , senators seemed cheered by the chance to engage mr . obama over the prospects of a grand bargain with republicans . senators are trying to get their arms wrapped around what a deal could be , mr . murphy said .
london no team has won successive european###cups since the format changed to the 32 club champions###league back in , but bayern###munich has laid down a marker that it has the athletic power , the tactical flexibility and , above all else , the willpower to change that . munich did not just beat manchester###city on wednesday###night . it pulverized the english team on the same field where city had destroyed manchester united less than two weeks###ago . the final###score told only half the story . bayern 's 3 1 victory hid the full discrepancy by which the muncheners imposed their supremacy . bayern 's tempo outpaced city in every corner of the field . the visiting###team made two passes for every one attempted by the home side . and it was not just passes there was an embarrassing gulf between the two clubs in the other basic skills of the sport , like movement and striking ability . compliments to our team , said arjen###robben , whose goal on wednesday set a record as he became the first bayern###munich player to score in five straight###games in the top european tournament . those goals stretch back to the semi###finals###and###final of last season 's tournament . robben did something that even gerd###m###ller , whose phenomenal records through the 1960s and 1970s included 79 goals in 70 games in european###competitions , could not accomplish . m ller was a goal scorer , and only that . robben is a winger who , like franck###rib###ry on the other flank , constantly darts in and out and up and down , from wide positions on the field . there was a time when robben was indulgent . he was always good , but he played to please himself . munich has taught him differently . jupp###heynckes , the former coach , demanded that every man runs for the team . that includes robben , franck###rib###ry and thomas m ller , the three scorers on wednesday . it is an attitude , an example of athleticism , exemplified by bastian###schweinsteiger , the workhorse in midfield , and by philipp###lahm , the captain . lahm is , or was , one of the world 's most energetic and astute fullbacks . heynckes used him right or left , depending on what the team needed . but heynckes retired after munich claimed every trophy available to it last year champions###league , bundesliga and german###cup . his successor , pep###guardiola , had nothing to do but to keep the engine ticking . well , it 's the same engine . but guardiola being guardiola , he has already fine###tuned it . lahm is currently not playing on either side of the rearguard . the new coach has put him in central###midfield , nominally as a defender in front of the defense . our midfield players were injured , guardiola said , but we are lucky to have philipp###lahm playing in that position . he is the best fullback in the world , but if i played him as a striker , he would be the best striker there is . the new coach described lahm as among the most intelligent , most adaptable players he has come across . that is saying a lot when you consider where guardiola came from and the players he worked with at barcelona . but it is n't simply the captain . it appears that the whole crew of bayern is up for any conversion , any adaptation of what they achieved half a year ago . guardiola asked them to put pressure on city 's high###priced players , right back to the goalkeeper . press they did , and it was the keeper , the best in england , joe###hart , who cracked . hart was beaten twice with shots low down inside his near post , where goalkeepers reckon they never leave space , never mind get a hand on a shot but allow it across the line . that happened on the first goal from rib###ry and on the third from robben . and in between , hart and left back ga l clichy got their lines crossed and allowed m ller to stroll through to score . we got beat by a better team , admitted city fullback micah###richards . their movement in midfield was where the game was won tonight . good luck to them . manuel###pellegrini , the manchester coach who was hired this summer specifically to address the team 's poor###record in europe , appeared emotionally drained by the gulf between the teams . we played really bad , he said . we must revise a lot of things with our players . a really smart goal scored with a sweeping turn and rising shot from lvaro negredo could not console anyone connected to city , not least the abu###dhabi sheik who has poured extraordinary sums into the team since buying it . negredo 's goal came too late and came at a time when munich was making its substitutions , withdrawing robben and rib###ry and schweinsteiger for another day . their job , their annihilation of a team they had previously regarded as credible opposition , was already done . city must revise , indeed . so must any other team intending to take munich 's title . that includes real###madrid , which cruised to a###4 0 victory over copenhagen to paris st . germain , which beat benfica and to manchester united , which drew 1 1 at shakhtar###donetsk . but if munich is , in the words of robben , really , really nice to play for , there was one other individual making history on wednesday . his name is konstantinos mitroglou . he plays for olympiacos , and with three strikes the third a classically stroked shot into the top corner of the net he scored all the goals in his club 's 3 0 victory over anderlecht in brussels . mitroglou is big , he 's bearded , and when he 's in the mood , he scores hat###tricks for fun . it was not just the first time a greek has scored three in a champions###league match it was the first time that happened in the 58 year history of the european###cup . one caveat . although mitroglou was born in kavala 25 years###ago , his family moved###abroad shortly after that . there is , would n't you know it , plenty of german schooling in mitroglou .
st . petersburg , fla . desmond###jennings drove in the winning###run with a two out single in the bottom of the ninth###inning tuesday###night , lifting the tampa###bay###rays to a 7 6 victory over the miami###marlins . the rays came back from an early 4 0 deficit and won their third in a row . miami lost its seventh###straight game . kelly###johnson opened the ninth with an infield single and took second on evan###longoria 's single off mike###dunn . with two outs , jennings singled against chad###qualls . jennings , luke###scott and yunel###escobar each had three of tampa###bay 's 16 hits . greg###dobbs' two out single off joel###peralta gave the marlins a 6 5 lead in the eighth . singles by scott , jennings and escobar off dunn tied it in the bottom half . chris###coghlan homered , tripled and drove in three runs for the marlins . miami scored five or more runs in a second straight game for the first time this season . marcell ozuna doubled in the miami second , extending his hitting###streak to 13 games , and scored on justin###ruggiano 's single . the marlins made it 4 0 in the third against jeremy###hellickson with the help of rbi triples by derek dietrich and coghlan . coghlan led off the sixth with his first home###run of the season . hellickson pitched 5 1 3 innings , giving up five runs on seven hits . miami starter kevin###slowey also pitched into the sixth , leaving after a double by scott . jose lobaton 's two run double off ryan webb later in the inning tied it at . johnson doubled home a run in the third . he has 25 rbis in 22 games this month . notes rays lhp david price threw for a second straight day , but the al cy###young###award###winner will miss a third start since straining his left triceps on may . the rays have made no announcement indicating price will be taken off the dl when he becomes eligible friday . ... marlins infs joe mahoney ( right hamstring strain ) and donovan solano ( left intercostal strain ) are expected to start playing in minor###league games by the end of the week . rhp nathan###eovaldi ( right shoulder inflammation ) could be ready to return after two more minor###league starts .
cooper tire and rubber 's efforts to require apollo tyres to complete its proposed takeover for . 3 billion has suffered another legal setback , paving the way for apollo , an indian company , to walk away from the deal . on monday , the delaware###supreme###court dismissed the appeal by cooper , an american company , against a lower###court###ruling that apollo was meeting its obligations in trying to reach new contract terms with unions at cooper plants in ohio and texas . with the latest court###ruling , cooper has only a slim###chance to keep apollo from walking away from the deal . apollo , which would become one of the world 's biggest tire makers if the deal were completed , wants to pay less than the 35 per share agreed to in june because of demands by unions at cooper plants and disruptions at cooper 's venture in china . apollo said tuesday in a statement that it was pleased with the decision . cooper 's litigation strategy to date has done nothing but generate unnecessary cost for its shareholders and for apollo , and compound the obstacles that cooper 's situation has created for this merger , the statement said . apollo , which was seeking to cut its dependence on domestic###sales through the cooper acquisition , said it continued to believe in the merits of the merger with the american company and that it was committed to finding a sensible way forward , if possible . cooper said in a statement tuesday that the supreme###court verdict was a procedural ruling that returned the case to the lower court , the court of chancery . cooper believes apollo has breached the merger###agreement and we will continue to pursue our legal###options , cooper said . a new ruling would have to be issued by dec . 31 , when the merger###agreement allows apollo to walk away . apollo stock rose as much as . 7 percent on tuesday , to . 15 rupees , or . 49 , a###level last seen before the deal was announced in june , as investors bet on the indian company dropping its pursuit to acquire cooper . the stock closed up . 2 percent .
new orleans baltimore quarterback joe###flacco , one of the quietest and most polite players in the middle of two boisterous franchises in new orleans for super###bowl xlvii , made some waves monday###night when he was quoted as being critical of the decision to hold the super###bowl at metlife###stadium in east###rutherford , n.j. , next year . flacco , a new jersey native , used an offensive term to describe the idea . i think it 's retarded , flacco was reported to have said . i probably should n't say that . i think it 's stupid . if you want a super###bowl , put a retractable dome on your stadium . then you can get one . asked to clarify his remarks during media day , flacco expressed###regret for using the term , but did not back down from his belief that the game should not be held in a cold###weather city unless the stadium has a roof . they 've done it the way they 've been doing it for 47 years , flacco said . there 's a lot that goes into this game , more than just playing the game it 's about the fans and it 's about the players that played for the right to get there . there are a lot of things that go into it and it 's just kind of a crazy decision , i believe . with average daytime###highs in february of about 40 degrees , the super###bowl in new jersey will have a chance of breaking the record###low for the game , set in new orleans in , with a temperature at kickoff of 39 degrees . bills back in toronto the buffalo###bills and rogers###media announced a new agreement that will keep rogers###centre in toronto as the team 's second home . buffalo will play one regular###season###game at the home of the blue###jays for the next five years , and the new contract also includes one preseason###game in .

a portfolio balanced between stocks###and###bonds , in a roughly 60 40 split , is a staple###diet of investing . these two asset###classes often move to different rhythms , so overall returns tend to have milder swings than either one experiences on its own . but this conventional mix may not be as appealing as it used to be , some investment###advisers say . bonds are extremely overvalued with yields at multiyear lows , they say , and while they view stocks as more reasonably priced , they acknowledge that the ups###and###downs of the last few months are liable to rattle investors' nerves . what can be done ? some advisers suggest adding fresh###ingredients to a portfolio , by buying so called core plus funds that hold a broader variety of assets . others recommend sticking patiently with the traditional###recipe . but either way , they warn , investors should prepare for something that may be less palatable than they are accustomed to . this is not a great time to be investing in anything right now due to volatility in the markets and the enormous amount of macroeconomic uncertainty , said harold ratner , a senior investment strategist at morningstar . across the board , nothing is screamingly attractive . but if investors have the luxury of staying fully invested , mr . ratner does n't consider the two main###asset classes ugly enough to suggest abandoning conventional balanced funds . if investors are saving for retirement or another long###term###goal , then owning the funds is probably an o.k . thing to do , he said , adding that the world has not changed that much in the last five or six years that you would need to change your strategy . someone who is more adventurous , or more sensitive to changing market conditions , might look at core plus funds , he said . although these vehicles keep a large majority of their assets in stocks###and###bonds , they also invest in alternatives like commodities , real###estate###investment###trusts or hedge###fund strategies . depending on how they invest , morningstar will classify them as conservative allocation , moderate allocation , aggressive allocation or world allocation funds , all niches in the balanced fund category . rob arnott , chairman and chief###executive of the investment advisory###service research affiliates , is among those who say it 's time to branch out from conventional funds . he tells investors that they urgently need to build a third pillar . in mr . arnott 's opinion , an investment in alternatives is wise in the interest of diversification and risk###reduction , but if inflation flares up down the road , as he expects , it would worsen the outlook for stocks###and###bonds enough to warrant particularly large allocations elsewhere . stocks###and###bonds are going to be a big###mistake for years , he said . do yourself the favor of building a modest third pillar that can protect you against inflation . bonds perform###poorly in an inflationary environment , something that mr . arnott expects as a result of very loose monetary###policy , he explained , and valuations on stocks fall because inflation generally sends interest rates higher . the drawback to expanding beyond the two main classes now is that alternative assets have joined them in the mainstream , said christopher cordaro , chief###investment###officer of regentatlantic capital , a financial###planning firm in morristown , n.j . many investors have been buying such alternatives to the point that they may have become overvalued . with bond yields at all time lows , investors are looking elsewhere for yield , mr . cordaro said . they 're pouring money into reits , commodities and hedge###funds . this is not the time to get too fancy . i think investors are taking on a huge amount of risk and not realizing it . one evergreen risk of owning any balanced fund stems from the difficulty of knowing what it contains . one portfolio that holds only stocks###and###bonds might be limited to blue###chips and investment grade bond issues , said mr . ratner , the morningstar strategist , while another might reach into emerging###markets , small company stocks and high###yield corporate###debt . when a portfolio starts adding alternative assets , the complexity only climbs from there . the mix might include some holdings that investors would prefer to avoid , advisers say , but because managers report holdings only intermittently , shareholders do n't always know what 's coming or going from their funds . then there is the matter of management quality . an investor who buys a balanced fund , other than one that passively tracks stock and bond indexes , is placing faith in a manager 's ability to be a jack of all trades or at least a jack of two trades . i 'm generally not a big fan of balanced funds because i like to control the mix , said kent kramer , a partner of the foster###group , a financial###planning firm in west###des###moines , iowa . he would rather own separate portfolios to gain###exposure to various kinds of stocks###and###bonds . the vast###majority of investors are going to have a better experience and probably with a lot less cost with a more limited mix of assets , he said . 'souped up' sometimes really means more expensive , and i do n't know if you 're getting bang for the buck . he advises investors who are interested in balanced funds to start the search with vanguard , a fund provider known for low expenses . with vanguard , you get a good explanation of the fees , and the fees are low , he said . the vanguard balanced index###fund seeks to replicate the msci u.s . broad market###index of stocks and the barclays###capital u.s . aggregate float adjusted###index of bonds in the traditional 60 40 ratio . it has annual expenses of . 24 percent and gets four stars from morningstar and a gold rating in the firm 's more subjective analyst rating system . core plus funds favored by morningstar analysts include t . rowe###price capital appreciation and leuthold core investment . the price fund , which gets five stars and a gold rating , the highest on both scales , holds domestic and foreign stocks and conventional bonds , along with convertible bonds , preferred stocks and leveraged loans . the leuthold fund , with four stars and a silver rating , likewise owns domestic and foreign stocks###and###bonds , as well as reits and gold . mr . ratner encourages investors in balanced funds to consider buying not just one , but rather a handful of them , and to make sure that each holds assets in different proportions , even if the assets are just stocks###and###bonds . if they seek funds whose managers prefer more assets or more trading among them , he added , they should remember that more does n't###necessarily mean better . investors need to make sure that they 're comfortable with these additional risks , he said , and that the managers can add value .
cleveland soon after he was hired to manage the indians last october , terry###francona found a place to live within two blocks of progressive###field , choosing to stay close to the stadium , as he had done when he managed at fenway###park for eight years . on monday , during his morning###walk to the ballpark for cleveland 's home###opener , francona said he encountered plenty of friendly , welcoming people , which was particularly helpful for a newcomer . yeah , thank goodness , because i got lost three times , he said . i 'm bad . even when i got to the garage , two people who work here said , 'do you know where you 're going ? ' i was like , 'nope . ' but once he finally found his bearings , the scene before him was all too familiar . in the other dugout was an old foe in recognizable road grays , with a player named robinson cano , who used to cause havoc against francona 's boston###red###sox . cano had a breakout###game monday , hitting two solo homers and scoring four runs to lead the yankees to an 11 6 victory over the indians and spoiling francona 's home###debut . when cano starts###feeling good , he can hit anybody , anywhere , francona said . that 's the last guy we want to get hot . it was the 160th game francona had managed against the yankees , with the philadelphia###phillies , the red###sox and now the indians , not including seven american###league###championship###series games . throw in a few contentious games in spring###training , and francona has managed more than the equivalent of a full season against the yankees , many of those games against joe###girardi . i just saw him , as i was walking out , in a cleveland uniform , and it looks a little different , girardi said before the game . i 'm so used to seeing him in a boston uniform . the game also served as a homecoming for travis###hafner , the former indians player who signed a one year , 2 million deal with the yankees in the off season . hafner still makes his home in a suburb of cleveland , and his wife and some friends were on hand to see him hit a three run homer in the first inning . he drove in four runs and scored three times . hafner played 10 years in cleveland and hit 99 home###runs at progressive###field before joining the yankees , so when was introduced before the game , he received a loud ovation from the announced crowd of , 567 . it was really special , something i 'll###never###forget , hafner said . but after his 100th home###run here , he was not received quite as well . girardi said , i noticed they did n't cheer him much after the first at bat . the game also featured the home###debut of nick###swisher , who signed a four year , 56 million deal in the off season to be the indians' first baseman , after four years in right field for the yankees . in his first at bat against his former team , he singled of hiroki###kuroda through an infield shift and scored to help the indians wipe out the yankees' early 3 0 lead . but the yankees came back in the third as cano and hafner combined to produce a run , and the yankees added runs in each of the next four innings to take a commanding lead . kuroda settled down to throw five and a third innings , allowing three runs , five hits and four walks . he struck out six , showing no problems with the sore right middle###finger that he injured on a line###drive back to the mound in his first start last wednesday . cano came into the game with three hits in 23 at bats , but he laced a double off the left###field###wall in the third and scored on hafner 's base hit . his first home###run was a high , arching blast in the fifth off indians starter ubaldo jimenez . he then he hit one to right field in the sixth off matt###albers . both came on first pitch off speed pitches . i 've been chasing pitches out of the strike###zone , cano said . the thing to do today was to swing at strikes . francona had seen this kind of thing . cano hit . 314 against the red###sox with 17 homers and 77 runs batted in while francona was in boston . now he is in cleveland , and cano is doing similar damage . francona was part of an off season renovation for the indians , who also added swisher , center###fielder michael###bourn and the designated###hitter mark###reynolds as they look to end their streak of four straight sub . 500 seasons . tickets for opening day sold out in six minutes , and fans were tailgating hours before the game . the ceremonial first pitches were thrown out by five sets of former major###league fathers to their sons , three of which included tito###francona to terry , steve###swisher to nick and sandy###alomar to the indians coach sandy###alomar###jr . for the yankees , it was their third opening day of the season , including their own and the detroit###tigers' home###opener , and the first that they won . telephone communication between the yankees' dugout and the bullpen did not operate during monday 's game , so the yankees sent starting###pitcher ivan nova to relay###messages . ... the yankees announced that the premier###league teams chelsea and manchester###city would meet at yankee###stadium on may spain will play ireland there on june 11 in a friendly . ... eduardo nunez returned to the lineup after missing two games with a bruised right biceps .
( reuters ) san###antonio###spurs guard tony###parker apologized on monday after a three year old photo surfaced of him making the same anti###semitic gesture that has landed former france striker nicolas###anelka in trouble . known in france as a quenelle , the gesture is said to be a reverse nazi###salute and has been made famous by french comedian dieudonne , who started using it in . while this gesture has been part of french culture for many years , it was not until recently that i learned of the very negative concerns associated with it , frenchman parker said in a statement released by national###basketball###association 's spurs . when l was photographed making that gesture three years###ago , i thought it was part of a comedy act and did not know that it could be in any way offensive or harmful . since i have been made aware of the seriousness of this gesture , i will certainly never repeat the gesture and sincerely apologize for any misunderstanding or harm relating to my actions . the photo of parker , a french national###team member and three time nba###champion , shows him making the hand###gesture with dieudonne . anelka made the controversial gesture after scoring a goal for his english###premier###league soccer team west###bromwich###albion on saturday . he is facing an fa investigation .
connecticut on monday became the first state to pass a bill that would require food manufacturers to label products that contain genetically###modified ingredients but only after other conditions are met . gov . dannel p . malloy has said he would sign the bill into law , after reaching an agreement with the legislature to include a provision that the law would not take effect unless four other states , at least one of which shares a border with connecticut , passed similar regulations . the connecticut bill also hinges on those states including northeastern###states with a total###population of at least 20 million . this bill strikes an important balance by ensuring the consumers' right to know what is in their food while shielding our small###businesses from liability that could leave them at a competitive###disadvantage , mr . malloy said in a statement issued over the weekend after negotiations on the necessary provisions . the legislature passed the bill on monday , 134 to . more than 20 other states are considering labeling laws , including new york , maine and vermont . early polling suggests widespread###support for a ballot###initiative that would require labeling in washington , as concern spread about the impact of genetically###engineered salmon and apples on two of the state 's marquee businesses . in , alaska passed a law requiring the labeling of all genetically###engineered fish and shellfish , but connecticut would become the first state to adopt labeling broadly . cathleen enright , executive###vice###president for food and agriculture at the biotechnology###industry###organization , said the industry supported voluntary labeling for genetically###engineered ingredients . dr . enright noted that the food###and###drug###administration typically required labeling of foods only when issues like food###safety , consumer health or nutrition were at stake . she also said labeling by an individual state might put that state 's industry and businesses at a disadvantage compared with other states . andrew kimbrell , executive###director of the center###for###food###safety , called connecticut 's move an important first step , and a reminder of where the tide is going on this issue . mark kastel , co director of the cornucopia institute , a liberal farm policy research group , said that while the triggers were unusual , they could work to the labeling movement 's advantage . the hurdles in the connecticut bill , if surmounted , would mean a critical###mass in the marketplace that would emulate the impacts that would have materialized if california had passed its ballot###initiative , mr . kastel said . big food and seed companies like monsanto and dow spent tens###of###millions of dollars last fall to help defeat a ballot###measure in california that would have required labeling . but whether other states will go as far as connecticut is unclear . in new mexico , the state###senate voted not to adopt the report of its committee recommending labeling , effectively###killing the labeling effort there . efforts in vermont , hawaii and maine have stalled . and on monday , the new york labeling bill was defeated in committee after members , including several who were co sponsors of the legislation , were lobbied intensely by a representative from the council for biotechnology information , a trade group whose members are basf , bayer cropscience , dow agroscience , dupont monsanto and syngenta all major makers of genetically###modified seeds and pesticides that work with them . assemblywoman linda b . rosenthal , democrat of manhattan , said there were more than 40 co sponsors when it went into the committee . we had the votes lined up to pass this , and then the lobbyist for monsanto and the other big seed companies showed up and was speaking to members and calling them and visiting their offices , she said . ms . rosenthal said she intended to continue to press for a labeling bill in new york .
shortly before the n.f.l . draft five years###ago , a reporter visiting joe###flacco 's childhood home a few miles from philadelphia was asked by his father , stephen , you draw the short straw with this story ? his son was sprawled on a living###room sofa , his long###legs stretched out while he watched matt###ryan being interviewed on television . flacco was the accidental prospect then , so unsure about his football future that after his junior###season in college , he asked his football###coach if it was o.k . if he played###baseball . his coach informed him he was going to be a draft###choice , prompting flacco to reply , really , coach ? flacco is a prospect no more , although monday , owing to his sleeplessness , he had the same look of detachment as he did that spring day in the home where he still shared a bedroom with his brother , where a batting###cage sat in the backyard . he had just received the keys to a corvette he was shocked , he said for being the most valuable###player of the super###bowl , won by the baltimore###ravens , 34 31 , over the san###francisco 49ers . he was off to walt###disney###world , then to new york to appear on david###letterman 's show monday###night and then eventually back to baltimore for the requisite victory parade . the vertiginous climb that carried him from also ran at the university of pittsburgh has put him ahead of ryan , who was drafted before him , and into the stratosphere of championship quarterbacks . how far he has risen will be quantified later this off season when the ravens will have to come to contract terms with him . no other football free###agent has done more in one year to solidify his bargaining###position than flacco . he turned down the ravens' offer last july reported to be about 16 million a year telling his agent , joe linta , that he thought he would improve . linta said he thought flacco should be paid like a top five quarterback . there was no animosity with the ravens , but there also have not been any negotiations since then . now there will be , under entirely different circumstances , a snapshot of the shifting landscape teams face when they roll the dice on contracts . the ravens gambled and will now pay for it , either in the form of a long###term contract , or with the franchise###tag . flacco 's contract , for five years and 29 million , is about to expire . if the ravens use the exclusive rights tag , they will spend about 20 million next year on flacco but block any other suitors . if they use the nonexclusive tag , likely worth around . 6 million , they risk losing flacco to a franchise willing to give up two first round###picks for him . before this postseason , that would have seemed a ludicrous proposition . no longer . at just 28 it seems flacco has been around much longer because the ravens have been in the playoffs in each of his five seasons flacco moved himself into joe###montana and kurt###warner territory , throwing 11 touchdown passes and no interceptions in baltimore 's run to the super###bowl title . late sunday###night , flacco joked with nfl###network that the team###owner steve###bisciotti had told him in a private conversation that if the team won the super###bowl , flacco could go pound on his desk and stick it to him in contract negotiations . that , flacco said , was exactly what he intended to do . maybe i was lowballing it by saying top five , linta , who was losing his voice , said monday###morning . right now , you have to look at that , based on current events . you have to be mindful of , when a deal is done of this magnitude , are you doing the deal based on what they 've already done or what he 's going to do ? on both fronts , joe is exemplary . eleven touchdowns . all those road playoff wins . only a moron would say that is not significant . flacco has long been considered a step below the top tier quarterbacks , but if his joe cool persona has undermined his profile even ray###lewis encouraged him to become more vocal , a suggestion flacco rejected as unnecessary to leadership he already has as many championships as drew###brees , peyton###manning and aaron###rodgers . brees 's contract , reached last off season , is the one to watch in flacco 's negotiations . it was for 100 million over five years , and was as much a gift for what brees had done as for what the saints hoped he could do again . brees just turned . we did n't###sit there in july and say , 'i 'll turn this down and i 'll show them , ' linta said . it was , 'i think i 'm getting better and we 'll be worth more down the road . ' this salary###cap is going to go up eventually , and you do n't want to be late to the dance on the rising cap numbers . you want to participate when the cap does accelerate . the relatively flat salary###cap which is projected to be just at or slightly below 121 million in 2013 will complicate the negotiations because the ravens are loaded with free###agents , including some who were critical to their super###bowl victory . while lewis is retiring , linebacker paul###kruger , who had four and a half sacks in the postseason , and linebacker dannell ellerbe are free###agents . so is cornerback cary###williams , who somehow avoided ejection in the super###bowl despite shoving one of the officials during a skirmish offensive###lineman bryant###mckinnie and tight###end dennis###pitta . and coach john###harbaugh said sunday that he and safety ed###reed , who insists that he will not retire after winning his first title in his hometown , talked on the bus after the game and agreed that they wanted reed back in baltimore . securing flacco is certainly the first priority , and a long###term deal would free cap space to allow the ravens to keep some of the other players . but the ravens are now facing the n.f.l . version of the rubik 's cube , trying to piece together a puzzle with so many moving###parts . i 'm pretty optimistic , but who knows ? the sleepy flacco said monday###morning . there 's all kinds of crazy###things that can happen with these contracts that we 've all seen before . nothing crazier than what flacco has been through , though . on saturday , he and his wife wanted to get out of the team hotel . they hopped in a cab , which took a half###hour to go the few packed blocks to caf du###monde in the french###quarter . flacco raved about the beignets , but then found himself channeling a mall santa , with a line of fans bearing cameras . for the player who had trouble being recruited out of high###school , who knew nothing of the football factory process , who thought just six years###ago that his future in the sport was so hopeless he might as well try baseball , the rise has been as great as the raise he is about to receive .
kansas###city , mo . during their recent three game series in colorado , joe###girardi had a lot of managing to do . without a designated###hitter , with his bench shortened by injury , and without the usual heavy###hitters in his lineup , he had to improvise . a lot . he moved the pitcher around in the batting order , he made numerous pitching changes and double switches , and even used a career outfielder at third base , all of it just to win two games . here at kauffman###stadium , girardi did not have to do quite so much tinkering . it was more of a sit back and enjoy contest , although girardi is not one to relax during a game . but the result was the same . the yankees pounded the kansas###city###royals , 11 6 , and girardi won his 500th game as yankees manager . shortly after the game , the yankees saluted their skipper , toasting him with champagne as mariano###rivera gave a brief speech noting the accomplishment . girardi became the seventh yankees manager to win 500 games , joining joe###mccarthy , joe###torre , casey###stengel , miller###huggins , ralph###houk and billy###martin , all of whom won at least . i 'm fortunate , girardi said . as a child you dream about playing in the big###leagues , and i do n't know if you dream about managing , but as i got older it was something i really wanted to do , and i got a great###opportunity . the timing of the milestone was appropriate because the victory kept the surprising yankees in first place by percentage###points in the american###league###east , and because girardi has been finding###ways to help his short handed team win . he has had assists from general###manager brian###cashman , who took several players off baseball 's junk pile and watched them turn into vital members of the team . they include vernon###wells , who played an inning of third base on wednesday kevin###youkilis ( now part of the yankees' lengthy injured###list travis###hafner and lyle###overbay , who had a home###run , two doubles and five runs batted in friday . that list could also include ichiro###suzuki , who was signed to a two year deal in the off season and had three hits and three r.b.i . on friday , and shawn kelley , who had his best outing as a yankee , striking out six in two and a third perfect innings of relief . on the night when girardi joined a select###group of yankee managers , cashman gave credit to the man he hired to manage the team after torre left following the 2007 season . he 's been tremendous , cashman said . he went on to praise girardi as just an excellent manager , adding he 's everything i thought he would be when i hired him . before every series , before every game , he 's all about preparation . he knows the game and he works his tail off . girardi won 78 games when he managed the florida###marlins in , but few were as easy as this one . and with the bullpen worn out from the series in colorado , the blowout was more than welcome . the yankees scored four times in the second inning as suzuki and overbay each hit two run homers . starting###pitcher phil###hughes handed much of that back when he gave up a three run homer to the no . 9 hitter jarrod###dyson with two outs in the second inning . it was the first home###run dyson had hit since . hughes allowed six runs in five and two thirds innings in his worst###start of the season , but still earned the win to even his record at . he was followed by kelley , who struck out the first five batters he saw . the yankees batted around in the sixth and scored five times . overbay hit another run###scoring double and brett###gardner pushed home a run with a triple . the wide###margin meant girardi did not have to decide whether to use rivera for the third game in a row , a situation he desperately wanted to avoid . rivera was making his first appearance at kauffman###stadium since he tore the anterior###cruciate###ligament in his right knee here on may 3 last year while shagging fly balls during batting practice . the injury required season ending surgery , but rivera has been perfect in his return this year , with 13 saves in 13 attempts . before the game the yankees had some fun with rivera by taping a hand painted sign on the outfield wall near where he crumpled to the turf in pain that day . the sign read , no mo zone , and had yellow caution tape around the perimeter and two red stop###signs , one in english and the other in spanish . rivera posed in front of the sign as he clutched his knee in mock pain before going out to shag more fly balls , just as he has his entire###career . a sight like that might make a manager cringe . but later on rivera made girardi bow appreciatively with his toast to the manager 's 500 wins .
the instructions were so simple it makes you wonder what part of just shut ... up alex###rodriguez did n't###understand . yankees gm brian###cashman 's directive the other day was calibrated for maximum###effect , sure . he knew exactly what he was doing . it 's why he tucked a profanity in the middle . but cashman also knows better than anyone that for better or worse probably worse , and certainly for the foreseeable future the ball###club and a rod are stuck with each other . bottom line , all he asked for at the moment was a little peace and quiet . like the majority of yankee fans and just about everybody else up and down the club 's chain of command , cashman probably wishes a rod would just retire , preferably to a mountain top retreat . or else beg for a trade , maybe to rodriguez 's hometown marlins , but ideally to a ball###club on the other side of world , say japan or korea . but cashman ca n't do a thing about it . rodriguez has a surgically repaired hip and a legally###binding contract . the yankees desperately need more offense , especially with mark###teixeira now out for the rest of the season with a bum wrist and rodriguez 's replacements at third hitting a combined . 240 , with just four homers and 23 rbis through wednesday . if a rod comes back after the all star break as planned , and manages at age 38 to put up marginally better numbers than those , the job will still be his . that 's assuming that he does n't get suspended , despite being tied to a now shuttered , anti###aging clinic in miami being investigated for dispensing performance###enhancing###drugs . it 's hardly a good solution , but right now it 's the only one . the yankees are committed to paying rodriguez him 28 million this year , and 86 million more through . dumb as that deal looks now , a rod makes it look even dumber every time he calls attention to himself . after benching him through last year 's playoffs , the yankees told rodriguez to focus more on baseball in the offseason than celebrity . but a rod could n't###resist . barely a week later , he was spied escorting former wwe wrestler and girlfriend of the moment torrie###wilson around beverly###hills , checking out pricey real###estate . next he opened a twitter###account and added another publicist or two to his already considerable stable . predictably , trouble soon followed . rodriguez' early posts were about things most people already knew , with the occasional exclamation###point to make it feel more like real news first time facing live pitching today ... simulated game yesterday nice to see real game pitching action ! so , presumably , when a team###doctor cleared a rod to begin###playing real games , he simply treated it as more of the same visit from dr . kelly over the weekend , who gave me the best news the green###light to play games again ! cashman could have reacted by picking up the phone and directing rodriguez to the appropriate pages in the handbook regarding how injuries are reported . as manager joe###girardi reminded him after tuesday###night 's game , it goes through our training###staff , our doctors , our gm and then it probably gets to me . a day later , rodriguez picked up the phone and spoke with cashman and team president randy levine for 30 minutes . everybody is on the same page and we 're all going to communicate and work together to get alex back as quickly as possible , yankees spokesman jason zillo said . they 're all back on track . instead of letting the whole thing end there , someone inside a rod 's camp told###espn . com that rodriguez does n't###feel the club really wants him back . that 's likely true . but unlike rodriguez , and unlike all the past attempts to publicly shame their overpriced asset , the yankees said little . cashman 's terse just shut ... up was revealing for just how annoyed he 's become , but more than that , it was advice that a rod do the same . by coincidence , yankee captain derek###jeter took another step thursday in his own long rehabilitation from a broken ankle . rodriguez has always suffered in the comparison with jeter , and so it was one more time . part of the rehab process involves a minor###league assignment , and when reporters asked the date it would begin , all jeter said was , as soon as i can get out there , i 'll get out there . we have n't got that far yet . not that hard , is it ? jim litke is a national###sports columnist for the associated press . write to him at jlitke ap . org and follow him at twitter . com jimlitke .
denver j.d . martinez hit a go ahead rbi single in the eighth###inning , carlos pena connected for a home###run as part of a three run ninth , and the houston###astros rallied against colorado 's bullpen to beat the rockies 6 3 on wednesday###night . the astros overcame 12 strikeouts and troy tulowitzki 's first multihomer game since 2011 in taking the opener of a two game set at coors###field . marwin gonzalez led off the eighth with a single off reliever edgmer escalona . jose altuve was intentionally walked and rex brothers relieved escalona . brothers struck out jason castro but martinez hit a two out single up the middle , scoring gonzalez to put the astros in front by a run . colorado had runners on first and second with two outs in the bottom of the eighth but first baseman pena made a diving catch of jordan pacheco 's liner to end the threat . pena then started the ninth by homering off reliever rob scahill , called up from the minors prior to the game . the astros added two more runs on gonzalez 's run###scoring sacrifice and brandon###barnes' rbi single . tulowitzki homered in the ninth off reliever jose veras and off starter erik bedard in the fourth for his seventh career multihomer game . the last was aug . 27 , 2011 , against the los###angeles###dodgers . the rockies could n't take advantage of a solid start from tyler chatwood , who struck out 10 batters in six innings . the strikeout total was the most in a game by a rockies starter this season and a career###high for chatwood , who allowed two runs on four hits . bedard also pitched well and did not get a decision . he went six innings and allowed two runs on seven hits . it was the third consecutive outing in which he has allowed only two runs . houston struck first , getting a run in the second inning on matt dominguez 's sacrifice###fly . tulowitzki answered leading off the fourth , when he drove the first offering from bedard the opposite way into the right field seats . it was his 11th home###run of the season and also produced the 500th run scored of his career . tulowitzki 's two out double in the fifth drove in pacheco . but the astros tied it up at 2 all in the sixth when barnes scored on a sacrifice###fly by castro . chatwood escaped further damage in the inning when he fanned martinez and pena for his ninth and 10th strikeouts of the game . his previous high for strikeouts was six . notes the rockies recalled scahill from triple a colorado###springs and made room for him by optioning of charlie blackmon . ... the rockies are six games into a stretch in which they play 17 games in 17 days . ... the astros , whose triple a affiliate is in oklahoma###city , raised , 000 this week through the astros foundation to aid oklahoma 's tornado relief efforts . the money is being forwarded to the red###cross . ... the rockies acquired chatwood two years###ago from the angels in exchange for catcher chris###iannetta .
indianapolis on friday###afternoon , indiana###pacers coach frank vogel stood###alongside the court at bankers###life###fieldhouse with a group of reporters who playfully tried baiting him into giving an impromptu performance of the basketball trick he invented more than 25 years###ago , the one he had once performed on late###night###with###david###letterman . vogel demurred . i thought that video was deleted , he said . few things on the internet die so conveniently . vogel was informed that it had been rereleased , just in time for the postseason , and a quick search on google would deliver footage of the 13 year old vogel , with neatly parted brown hair and a red polo###shirt , spinning a basketball from the end of a toothbrush while brushing his teeth . i still do it all the time at backyard barbecues for my daughter 's friends , vogel said jokingly . he could turn heads with a toothbrush trick , but as a player growing up in wildwood crest , n.j. , along the jersey###shore , vogel lacked the size or quickness or athleticism to garner much attention otherwise . he developed basketball acumen , though , and a feel for the game , which guided the pacers to a central###division###title and into the eastern###conference###semifinals against the knicks . vogel says he has an outwork everybody in sight type of mind set , one he needed as a graduate###student manager at kentucky under the demanding coach rick###pitino and before that as a biology major studying feverishly to go to medical###school . he had dreams of being in sports as an orthopedic###surgeon . at tiny juniata###college , a division###iii liberal###arts school in huntingdon , pa . , vogel played###point###guard and took 16 credits in biology and organic###chemistry . he said orthopedics fit his basketball background and his intellectual###curiosity . i liked medicine , vogel said . i liked helping people . i liked the biology of it and understanding how the body works . by his sophomore year , though , the heavy class workload on top of his basketball duties grew overwhelming . i was giving everything i had to classes , and i was getting a . 6 , vogel said , referring to his grade###point###average . i knew that was n't going to get me into med###school . he watched pitino 's wildcats fall to duke in the 1992 east regional###final and set his mind on joining that program in some capacity . as with his toothbrush trick , vogel 's determination paid off , and he transferred to kentucky , where he was a student manager for pitino , played###point###guard on the junior###varsity team and finished his final two years of biology courses . vogel soaked up all he could from pitino and the assistant jim###o'brien , whom he would wind up working under for 17 years , until he replaced o'brien to become the interim###coach of the pacers in . as a manager and then graduate###assistant video###coordinator who lived in the wildcat lodge , the basketball players' dormitory , vogel immersed himself in the coaching rigor . he charted statistics in late###night games of one on one . he broke down film of summer scrimmages . it was almost like the guy did n't###sleep , said steve masiello , the kentucky point###guard in . masiello , now the coach at manhattan###college , said vogel 's razor###sharp basketball i.q. , from a schematic standpoint , was eye###opening to him . frank was probably 22 years old , not much older than me , basically the same type of goals as i had , and this guy would have cut me to shreds , masiello said . from that point on , i always knew he had a little different mind than most guys . now at the highest###level of basketball , vogel has not lost that edge or that interest in the analytical and schematic approach to the game , still studying basketball as he might feverishly cram for a biology seminar . he 's spent his whole career in the film room , pacers point###guard george hill said . he 's watching film 24 7 and has been doing it for years . but when it is time to work , vogel seems to know exactly what it takes to get the job done . it 's easy for us to play for him , pacers guard paul###george said . the way he approaches practices , film , game planning , everything is well thought out .
astronauts aboard the international###space###station will venture outside on three spacewalks to replace a malfunctioning pump that has shut down part of the station 's cooling system , nasa announced on tuesday . the space###agency also postponed until january the launching of a cargo supply###ship , which had been scheduled to lift off on thursday . the first spacewalk is on saturday , with the second on monday and the third next wednesday . two loops of circulating ammonia cool equipment on the station . the problem started last wednesday with a malfunction of a valve inside the pump , which is on one of the station 's exterior trusses . flight###controllers shut down that cooling loop . the remaining loop is sufficient for regulating the temperature of critical equipment , and nasa said there was no immediate danger to the six crew members . nasa managers want both cooling loops to be operating before the cargo###ship is sent into orbit . the orbital###sciences###corporation , a private company hired by the space###agency to bring cargo to the space###station , had rolled out its antares rocket , carrying , 230 pounds of supplies , to the launching###pad on wallops###island in virginia . the launching will now occur no earlier than jan . 13 . during the spacewalks , each lasting six and a half###hours , the nasa astronauts richard mastracchio and michael###hopkins will remove the malfunctioning pump module , which had been installed three years###ago , and replace it with a spare one . nasa also said it has fixed a problem with a spacesuit that led to the near drowning of luca parmitano , an italian astronaut , when his helmet started filling with water during a spacewalk in july . a faulty part has been replaced , and tests showed no further leaks .

sydney david###moyes left for tokyo on the third leg of manchester united 's pre###season###tour of the asia###pacific on sunday with his first win under his belt and the enormity of the job on his hands confirmed . the 50 year old , who took over when alex###ferguson retired at the end of last season , has been astonished by the passion for the club both on the first stop of the tour in thailand , where united lost , and in sydney , where they won 5 1 on saturday . more than , 000 turned out to watch the english champions train on friday###night and tickets for saturday 's match against an all star xi picked from the local a###league sold out in eight minutes with , 127 packed into the olympic###stadium . it was a good game for us , moyes said afterwards . ( but ) more importantly to get , 000 at the game and i 'd say all manchester united supporters is incredible and i thank all of them for coming to the game . it was a great night and a very special night to get my first victory as manchester united manager . with great support also comes great expectation and every day in the job makes it clearer and clearer just what a monumental task he faces to get anywhere close to his most hallowed predecessors matt###busby and ferguson . the enormity of the job sunk even more yesterday when i saw an incredible video about manchester united , seen sir###matt###busby followed by sir###alex###ferguson , he said on friday . if i did n't know it before , i certainly knew it when i saw what those two gentlemen had done before me . it 's a great job , it 's a fantastic club a football###club that everybody in the world knows the name of and i 'm very fortunate and privileged i was given the opportunity to manage . and i hope i can come as close to the success that the two gentlemen before me enjoyed . moyes 's task over the six years of his contract is to ensure he is being bracketed with the two illustrious scots and not with wilf###mcguinness , frank###o'farrell , tommy###docherty , dave###sexton and ron###atkinson , who were less successful in the job . the former everton manager also got an inkling this week of what kind of protection he can expect from the massed ranks of the manchester united machine , represented in sydney by nearly 200 club staff . australian reporters , who work in one of the most commercialized sporting environments in the world , were astonished by control exerted by the club in the few opportunities there were to talk to moyes over the week . at the post###match news conference on saturday , the club official accompanying moyes was trying to extract him from his chair pretty much as soon as he sat down . as a result , the story of the rift with wayne###rooney that threatens to end the england striker 's time at the club bubbled all week without a meaningful contribution from moyes the man whose comments apparently###caused it . there was precious little more information on moyes 's transfer targets , particularly the attempt to wrest barcelona midfielder cesc fabregas away from the camp###nou . i 've not had any more news , moyes said on saturday . i have no more updates on anything really , so there is nothing positive###or###negative .

texas a m quarterback johnny###manziel , facing allegations that he broke n.c.a.a . rules by receiving###payments for signing###autographs , has been suspended for the first half of the aggies' season###opener against rice on saturday . the n.c.a.a . and texas a m , in a joint###statement wednesday , said there was no evidence that manziel had received money in exchange for autographs , based on currently available information and statements by manziel . the statement referred to his infraction as an inadvertent violation regarding the signing of certain autographs . it left###open the possibility that the n.c.a.a . would further investigate if more information became available . for now , however , the potential of a significant penalty seems to be behind manziel , who won the heisman###trophy last season as a redshirt###freshman . about three weeks###ago , espn reported that the n.c.a.a . was investigating###claims that manziel had accepted a five figure flat###fee for signing###autographs at the site of the bowl###championship###series title game in january . texas a m submitted , and the n.c.a.a . accepted , conditions for manziel 's reinstatement to the team , including the suspension for half of saturday 's game . manziel must also address the team about the situation , and the university must revise how it educates its athletes about signing###autographs for individuals who present them with multiple items , according to the statement . student###athletes are often asked for autographs from fans , but unfortunately , some individuals' sole motivation in seeking an autograph is for resale , kevin lennon , an n.c.a.a . executive , said in the statement . it is important that schools are cognizant and educate student###athletes about situations in which there is a strong###likelihood that the autograph seeker plans to resell the items . john###sharp , the chancellor for the texas a m university system , said of manziel we all take the aggie code of honor very seriously , and there is no evidence that either the university or johnny violated that code . the situation involving manziel , a 20 year old who was the first freshman to win the heisman , became part of a wider###debate about whether college athletes should be allowed to be compensated for actions like signing###autographs . the n.c.a.a . bars such payments . to some observers , the relatively quick resolution to the manziel case , and the comparatively###light penalty , could add to criticism of the n.c.a.a . 's enforcement process , which has been chided for being unequal in levying sanctions . karen weaver , an associate###professor of sport###management at drexel , said it appeared that the n.c.a.a . handled manziel 's case with kid gloves . weaver added i 'm not sure another , lower profile athlete would have received the same consideration . the fact that they have given this much deferential treatment is highly###unusual , maybe different than any other athlete has received . manziel and texas a m have said little about the investigation , but fans , journalists and sports###talk show hosts have been busy in recent weeks making calculations about manziel 's fate and what it could mean for the aggies and the college###football season , particularly with texas a m awaiting a showdown against alabama on sept . 14 . texas a m handed alabama its lone loss last season , but the crimson###tide went on to win the national###title . manziel has become a larger than life figure on campus in college###station , tex . , and in the college###football world . last year , with his passing and running , he led the aggies to an 11 2 record , including a blowout###victory over oklahoma in the cotton###bowl . one of his highlights in the win over alabama in which he bobbled the ball before throwing a touchdown pass was repeatedly shown at the end of last season as he came into focus as a front runner for the heisman .
reaction wheels like the ones that nasa officials say have failed aboard the kepler spacecraft , effectively###ending its mission to detect potentially habitable###planets outside the solar system , are simple devices , at least in concept . but making ones that can survive the rigors of a rocket launching and then spin for a long time to keep a spacecraft properly oriented in kepler 's case , to keep its telescope precisely pointed at the same field of stars is difficult . really simply , it 's an electric###motor turning a flywheel , said doug sinclair , whose toronto company , sinclair interplanetary , makes tiny reaction wheels for suitcase size satellites . kepler 's wheels are bigger because kepler is bigger ( with a mass of more than a ton , but they function in the same way the rapidly###spinning flywheel is accelerated or decelerated , producing a corresponding slow rotation of the spacecraft in one direction or the other . the principle at work is one that physics students and figure###skaters are familiar with conservation###of###angular###momentum . there must be at least three wheels , one on each of three perpendicular axes . a spacecraft 's thrusters could also be used to control orientation , but there is a limited amount of propellant aboard . reaction wheels use electricity , which can be produced in essentially unlimited supply by a spacecraft 's solar###panels . but victoria l . coverstone , a professor of aerospace###engineering at the university of illinois , said that in some situations thrusters must still be used . the solar###wind can cause a small , constant rotation of the spacecraft that can make a reaction###wheel rotate faster and faster until it reaches its operational limit . when that happens , she said , a thruster can be fired to rotate the spacecraft in the opposite###direction and slow the wheel , a procedure referred to as a momentum dump . kepler has four wheels , providing some redundancy . one stopped###working last july after about three years of operation , and nasa announced last week that a second had failed . mr . sinclair said the most likely source of failure was in the flywheel bearings . that is the no . 1 challenge in building a wheel , he said . when you launch , you shake this thing , and you 're supporting this heavy flywheel on these bearings . that beats them up . then you spin them for years .
macy 's is seeing signs that the holiday###shopping###season will be strong . the department###store###chain reported on wednesday a quarterly profit that handily beat wall###street expectations , with the company citing revamped advertising and promotions for helping reverse a slip in sales in the previous quarter . macy 's chief###financial###officer , karen m . hoguet , said on a conference call with analysts and investors that traditional gift categories like fine###jewelry , cashmere and housewares were selling well . she also noted positive trends for cold###weather items like coats , boots and sweaters . if we have anything close to a normal weather pattern this year , this could add significant volume , she said . the holiday###shopping###season is a make or break time for retailers because it can account for as much as 40 percent of annual###revenue . this year , there are also six fewer###days between thanksgiving and christmas , intensifying the pressure for companies to perform . already , macy 's has said it plans to open on thanksgiving evening for the first time . we expect a heightened###sense of urgency among customers , so it 's important that we be ready for her every day , every time , in every way she shops , ms . hoguet said . retailers are also facing continuing concerns about shoppers' willingness to spend in the weak economy . macy 's , for example , has stepped up promotions , which led to a slide in gross###profit margins in the quarter . macy 's , which also operates the bloomingdale 's chain , is the first of the major###retailers to report third quarter results and is often seen as a barometer of spending among middle to upper income shoppers . for the fiscal third quarter that ended nov . 2 , macy 's reported its net###income rose 22 percent , to 177 million , or 47 cents a share , from 145 million , or 36 cents a share , a year earlier . revenue rose 3 percent , to . 28 billion . analysts had expected earnings of 39 cents a share on revenue of . 19 billion . revenue at stores open at least a year , a crucial retailing measure , was up . 5 percent . analysts had expected a.1 percent increase . earnings for the year are expected to be . 80 to . 90 a share , above wall###street 's expectations of . 78 a share .
cape###canaveral , fla . ( ap ) a recently###discovered comet is closer than it 's ever been to earth , and stargazers in the northern###hemisphere finally get to see it . called pan###starrs , the comet passed within 100 million###miles of earth on tuesday , its closest###approach in its first ever cruise through the inner solar system . the ice ball will get even nearer the sun this weekend just 28 million###miles from the sun and within the orbit of mercury . the comet has been visible for weeks from the southern###hemisphere . now the top half of the world gets a glimpse as well . the best viewing days should be next tuesday and wednesday , when pan###starrs appears next to a crescent###moon at dusk in the western sky . until then , glare from the sun will obscure the comet . california astronomer tony###phillips said the comet 's proximity to the moon will make it easier for novice sky watchers to find it . binoculars likely will be needed for the best viewing , he said , warning onlookers to avoid pointing them at the setting sun . wait until the sun is fully below the horizon to scan for the comet in the darkening twilight , phillips advised in an email sent from his home and observatory in the sierra###nevada mountains . pan###starrs' name is actually an acronym for the hawaiian telescope used to spot it two years###ago the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system . the volcano top telescope is on constant prowl for dangerous asteroids and comets that might be headed our way . thought to be billions of years old , the comet originated in the distant oort###cloud a cloud of icy bodies well beyond the orbits of neptune and pluto and somehow got propelled toward the inner solar system . it 's never passed by earth before , phillips said . a much brighter comet show , meanwhile , is on the way . comet###ison may come close to outshining the moon in november . it was discovered last september by russian astronomers and got its acronym name from the international scientific optical###network . neither pan###starrs nor ison pose a threat to earth , according to scientists .

's concussion committee . such demands for reform in body###checking and fighting may seem unrealistic . yet researchers made similarly ambitious recommendations after the first mayo###clinic hockey concussion conference , in , and leagues across north###america adopted many of them . the n.h.l . barred all targeted contact with the head and adopted a stricter , quiet###room protocol for in game evaluation of players believed to have sustained concussions . usa###hockey and hockey###canada increased the minimum###age for body###checking to 13 in response to a university of calgary study showing alarming injury rates for 11 and 12 year old players in alberta , where body###checking was allowed . at the mayo###clinic last week , researchers presented new findings suggesting more strongly than ever that repeated hits to the heads of hockey players can cause serious harm . and although there still is no conclusive###evidence that fighting specifically leads to brain###damage a justification the n.h.l . has used for tolerating it researchers like aynsley smith want to keep pressing . my concern is we ca n't###wait for the data that tell us all the neurons that died with each head impact before we stop unnecessary fighting , said smith , a mayo###clinic sports psychologist and an organizer of the conference . we need to take action now . one example of the latest findings comes from the university of ottawa , where researchers simulated the hits that commonly caused concussions in hockey players a head on check to the head a fall to the ice and a left or right hook to the jaw as thrown in a hockey fight and measured the forces they delivered to a helmet rigged with sensors . they found that the left or right hooks were by far the most likely to cause concussions , because of the sharp rotational forces they deliver to the brain . boxers and fighters in hockey know that the way to knock someone out is to catch him with a hook , and down he goes , said blaine hoshizaki , director of research at the university 's neurotrauma impact science laboratory . and lo###and###behold , we found that the hook delivered more than twice the rotational acceleration than anything else . it 's the most effective way to give someone a concussion . results like that are behind the researchers' call for junior###hockey to adopt the same prohibitions against fighting as youth hockey and the n.c.a.a . have , whereby a single fight results in immediate ejection and possible long###term suspension . they also want the n.h.l . to go to immediate ejections for fighting , for players' safety and because the league is the role###model for the rest of hockey . according to dr . michael###stuart , another conference organizer , the old argument that fighting deters more dangerous on ice behavior is shot down by the results of the ottawa study . the kind of blow delivered in a hockey fight , he said , is as dangerous to a brain as it gets . stuart 's support for a fighting ban carries weight . besides being the chief###medical###officer for usa###hockey , he has three sons and a son in law who have played in the n.h.l . the researchers also said that in game concussion protocols must be followed more strictly . mark aubry , the chief###medical###officer of the international###ice###hockey###federation and team###doctor for the ottawa###senators , told the conference that the latest findings reiterate the need to take players off for evaluation at the first sign of possible concussion instead of allowing them to stay on the ice or the bench . but the night before in san###jose , calif . , the rangers' nash continued to play after being staggered by an elbow to his jaw from sharks defenseman brad###stuart ( no relation to the mayo doctor . nash struggled to the bench in the game 's third minute but skated the rest of the first period before leaving the game for good . he is now out with what is officially###termed a head###injury . under the n.h.l . 's concussion protocol , nash should have been taken to an examination###room immediately . and although some might criticize the rangers for not seeming to follow that protocol strictly , they did keep nash out of the last two periods a big###change from what n.h.l . teams would have done , say , five years###ago . aubry , a member of the n.h.l . 's concussion subcommittee , will brief commissioner gary###bettman and other league officials about the mayo conference at the subcommittee 's next meeting in early###november . presumably , they will hear about researchers' calls for stricter concussion protocol compliance , curbs on injurious body###checking and an end to fighting . whether the n.h.l. , the minors and junior###hockey heed those calls remains to be seen . but if the trend of the last few years continues , under the scientists' influence , hockey will become a less dangerous###game to play .
phoenix ricky###nolasco looked right at home in dodger blue . the right hander made a sparkling debut for surging los###angeles on tuesday###night , limiting arizona to four hits in seven innings in a 6 1 victory , the dodgers' 14th win in 17 games . i was pretty pumped up , nolasco said . i have n't been that locked in in a long time . it worked out great . i was able to make good pitches . i was definitely excited . the energy and adrenaline was going those first few innings , so it was awesome . nolasco , acquired saturday in a trade with the miami###marlins , also doubled and singled , driving in a run and scoring another . it just gives you more confidence when you 're adding it to ( clayton ) kershaw , ( zack ) greinke and hyun###jin ( ryu , three pretty kind of top notch guys there at the top of the rotation , dodgers manager don###mattingly said . then to add ricky , if he can pitch like this , every time you go out there you think you 've got a good chance to win . adrian###gonzalez drove in three runs for los###angeles but hanley ramirez went 0 for , snapping his 19 game hitting###streak . ian###kennedy , facing the dodgers for the first time since serving a 10 game suspension for his role in a###bench###clearing###brawl a month ago in los###angeles , allowed six runs , five earned , and nine hits in 5 2 3 innings . he hit ramirez with a pitch in the first inning . the dodgers pulled within 2 games of the nl west leading diamondbacks . plate###umpire marvin hudson warned both benches after dodgers reliever ronald belisario hit miguel###montero in the leg with a pitch in the ninth###inning . belisario had warned after the brawl that it 's not over . he repeated that sentiment after the game but insisted he did n't hit montero on purpose . it 's not over , belisario said , but it was n't on purpose . so it 's still not over ? no , he said . the dodgers , who won by the same score in monday 's series opener , have won 11 of their last 13 against nl west opponents , picking up seven games in the standings since they were a season worst 9 out on june . nolasco , who fanned five with no walks , shut out arizona until the seventh , when aaron hill doubled off the glove of a diving yasiel###puig in right field and scored on martin prado 's single . arizona center###fielder adam eaton , making his season debut after being activated from the disabled###list , stumbled and dropped gonzalez 's fly ball at the warning###track with the bases###loaded in the fifth . kennedy had made his last seven starts on the road , including the june 11 outing in los###angeles , where he hit puig and greinke with high pitches in a testy game that included a bench###clearing melee . of the eight suspensions that followed , kennedy 's was the most severe at 10 games , although he missed just one start . the arizona right hander made things###interesting in the first inning tuesday when he plunked ramirez in the shoulder . nothing intentional , kennedy said . up and in changeup slipped out of my hand , he said . we know that kennedy 's not trying to hit hanley , mattingly said . that was a changeup . they were just trying to get in . that 's nothing . nolasco 's two out single to right brought in the game 's first run in the second . a.j . ellis and skip###schumaker singled to start the inning , then jerry###hairston###jr . grounded into a double###play , leaving a runner at third with two outs as the pitcher came to the plate . andre###ethier led off the dodgers fourth with a single . with ethier running on the play , ellis struck out but montero 's throw to second sailed into center###field and ethier wound up at third with one out . with the infield playing in to cut off the run , schumaker bounced one to second , but hill dropped the ball , ruining any chance for a play at the plate . schumaker was thrown out at first , but the unearned###run scored to make it . nolasco opened the fifth with a double to right center , then carl###crawford reached on a bunt single and puig walked to load the bases with no outs . gonzalez lofted one to deep center , where eaton lost his footing on the warning###track and as he fell to the ground the ball popped out of his glove for an error . two runs scored to make it . puig came barreling around third on the play and attempted to score , but montero took the relay throw from shortstop didi###gregorius . puig shoved montero as the tag was applied , then the two stared at each other as the young dodgers star walked toward the dugout . he plays with a lot of arrogance , kennedy said . i do n't know if he was trying to run ( montero ) over or what . after kennedy walked two to load the bases in the sixth , gonzalez 's two run single off tony###sipp broke it open at . gregorius robbed schumaker with a soaring grab of a line###drive to end the los###angeles seventh . notes kennedy leads the nl with 10 hit batters . detroit rhp doug###fister leads the majors with . ... arizona 3b eric###chavez was a late scratch with a sore hip . ... los###angeles pitchers have five hits in the first two games of the series . ... seeking a sweep , the dodgers send ryu , 2 . 82 era ) to the mound and arizona counters with tyler skaggs , 3 . 65 ) in a matchup of left handers wednesday###night .
louisville , ky . teddy###bridgewater had no . 9 louisville up by two touchdowns before he threw an incomplete###pass . bridgewater hit his first nine passes and matched a career best with five touchdown throws as the cardinals defeated ohio 49 7 on sunday . coming off an 11 2 finish and a sugar###bowl upset of florida , bridgewater and the cardinals dominated . that pleased a sellout###crowd of , 332 seeing them for the first time since that bcs win set off the school 's remarkable run of success that included an ncaa men 's basketball title , the women 's team 's runner up ncaa finish and an appearance in college###world###series . bridgewater kicked off his heisman###trophy campaign by going 23 of 28 for 355 yards . damian copeland and kai de la###cruz each caught two touchdowns and devante parker and robert###clark each had one . michael dyer , the former auburn star , debuted for louisville and broke off a 46 yard touchdown run in the third quarter . the cardinals outgained ohio . but it all started with bridgewater . he studies the game and studies the receivers and he does a great job of checking and taking what the defense gives him , louisville coach charlie###strong said . it was just fun to watch teddy . it 's just amazing how he keeps getting better and better . it was an impressive showing for a louisville squad out to prove that last year was n't a fluke while starting this season with high###expectations . the cardinals began with their highest preseason ranking in school history and are favored to win the new american###athletic###conference that would earn another bcs bowl bid . bridgewater has drawn even more attention following a breakout sophomore###season with , 718 yards passing and 27 touchdowns . he certainly met expectations in his season debut , completing his first nine passes for 121 yards before copeland dropped a catchable ball down the middle . by then louisville was up 14 0 after bridgewater hit copeland for touchdowns for 34 and 19 yards , helping the senior receiver match his 2012 total . the quarterback had a couple more drops and threw an interception , but was otherwise locked in and efficient in moving to fifth in program history for yardage and fourth in touchdown passes . i 'm all about this team executing , bridgewater said . at the end of the day , i play the game to build a relationship with guys in the locker###room and to win games . as far as individual stats , i could n't care less . if i go 0 for , i just want to win the game . like last season , bridgewater involved many targets in the offense and found them wide###open much of the day . parker was at least 10 yards past a defender when he caught a 27 yard pass for the cardinals' third td in the second quarter . de la###cruz meanwhile had 20 clear yards in front of him after catching a bridgewater pass for a 40 yard touchdown in finishing with team and career###highs of 116 yards on four catches . only clark faced ohio coverage before diving for his 25 yard score late in the third quarter . backup will gardner followed bridgewater in the fourth but did n't###miss a beat , hitting de la###cruz for 30 yard touchdown for a 49 7 lead . it felt great , said de la###cruz , a junior . no greater feeling to show what i 've been working on all summer and offseason training . ... it just felt very easy . louisville had hiccups such as four false###starts and a face###mask penalty in the first quarter . a pass###interference###penalty late in the third quarter helped ohio break the shutout as ryan boykin scored from 10 yards . but those were the only mistakes on a day that the cardinals cruised . they were hitting on all cylinders today , ohio coach frank###solich said . bridgewater was precision perfect on a lot of throws . at times , we made it a little easier than we should have made it for them as far as leaving receivers wide###open . still , their passing###attack obviously was a great passing###attack . ohio 's hopes of following up last year 's season opening upset of penn###state with another win over a bcs school were thoroughly dashed as the bobcats found little to nothing against a fierce cardinals defense . beau blankenship , a , 600 yard rusher last season , had just 22 yards on 12 carries and tyler tettleton completed 11 of 23 pass yards for only 140 yards and was briefly replaced by derrius vick in the first half . ohio had the ball for just 44 . cardinals defensive###end lorenzo mauldin , briefly hospitalized last week after a vehicle hit the moped he was riding , dressed and started on the right side . he was one of the first cardinals charging on to the field .
greenburgh , n.y . henrik###lundqvist 's nightmarish season took another bad turn wednesday when the rangers confirmed he had a lingering injury that would keep him out of thursday 's game at philadelphia . it 's something that 's day to day we think we can nip it in the bud , coach alain###vigneault said of the unspecified injury after lundqvist missed his third consecutive practice . cam talbot will make his n.h.l . debut against the flyers , and jason missiaen , recalled from hartford of the american###hockey###league , will be the backup . lundqvist said on twitter regarding my day to day injury . been dealing with it for 2 weeks , now was a good time to get back to . he added , last few days it 's been getting better with treatment and exercise . vigneault said if this would have been a playoff###game , he probably would be playing . it might take one more day or maybe two . but it 's something that we should be able to turn the page on and not hear about anymore . lundqvist won the vezina###trophy in , was a runner up for the award last season and is generally###considered the n.h.l . 's most consistent goaltender . his save###percentage in seven games is . 890 , 38th among the league 's 45 regular goalies entering wednesday 's games . ( lundqvist 's . 926 career percentage is second among active goalies , behind tim thomas . ) he followed his one strong###performance this season , a 2 0 shutout in washington on oct . 16 , with a shaky performance in a###4 0 defeat at new jersey on saturday . after that loss , which plunged the rangers to , lundqvist said his focus was off . it may merely be a short###term slump , and while there has been speculation that the new rule making leg pads two inches###shorter has left him more vulnerable , that seems unlikely because the goals he is surrendering have not been through the five hole . the most ominous theory involves the potential distraction of the stalled contract talks between his agent , don meehan of newport sports , and general###manager glen###sather . lundqvist is in the final year of a six year deal###worth . 875 million per year . he is believed to be asking for a contract that would make him the n.h.l . 's highest###paid goalie , somewhere around 8 million for the maximum eight years . if there is no agreement , he becomes a free###agent in july . vigneault said that the injury surfaced around 10 days###ago , but that lundqvist played well with it when he won in washington . he said it acted up a little bit after the devils game , when lundqvist felt it more and reported some irritation . lundqvist 's only appearance the last three days was before practice tuesday , when he briefly tested new skates . talbot , 26 , has a . 914 career save###percentage in five seasons with hartford . he was signed as an###undrafted###free###agent after playing four years at the university of alabama###huntsville , a hockey program that has produced just one n.h.l . player , jared ross , a former flyers part timer . talbot had a strong training###camp last month , and the rangers decided he was ready to take over as lundqvist 's backup . they waived martin###biron last week , which led to biron 's retirement , and talbot joined the big###leagues . i 've waited a long time for this , talbot said wednesday . it was n't until the last week of my college###career that i thought this would be a reality . it 's an unbelievable ride so far . i 'm just taking it all in .
east###rutherford , n.j . the 0 2 giants found a ray of hope this week in the knowledge that their last such start came in , when they swept their next six games and went on to win super###bowl###xlii . the belief that they can repeat such a turnaround could hinge on how they fare sunday against quarterback cam###newton and the carolina###panthers , an opponent they are meeting at a familiar time and place . the giants traveled to charlotte , n.c. , with a 1 1 record in their third regular###season###game last year . they used a 36 7 thumping of the panthers to start a torrid stretch in which they won five of six games . that helped###lead to a winning###record ( 9 7 ) but not a playoff###berth . there has to be a sense of urgency , defensive###end justin###tuck said of this year 's slow###start , because we are not getting those two games back . any sense of d j vu surrounding sunday 's kickoff in charlotte ends for the giants with the absence of running back andre brown . against the panthers on sept . 20 , 2012 , brown carried 20 times for 113 yards and 2 touchdowns . he and the rest of the giants' offense played the best possible defense against newton by keeping him off the field the giants dominated the time of possession , keeping the ball for 36 minutes 10 seconds . this year , brown is on injured###reserve until mid###november with a broken left###leg . the giants have missed his hard###charging style . with their aging offensive###line struggling to create running lanes , they have 33 rushing attempts for 73 yards , a meager . 5 yards per game . it appears the defense will also be lacking a key###figure cornerback corey###webster is listed as doubtful after missing friday 's practice with a hip###injury . aaron###ross is expected to make his first start for the giants since super###bowl###xlvi to close the 2011 season . he left as a free###agent to sign with jacksonville but played only one year with the jaguars before he was released . ross said that he had not been told he would start but that he would embrace the opportunity . i love to play . i love to compete . i 'm a fierce###competitor , he said . any time i have a chance to go out there , i 'm excited . ross , drafted by the giants in the first round in , said he had always been ready to rejoin the lineup . he said of his study habits it 's the same as it is every week . i go in preparing like i 'm a starter , because you never know what is going to happen . ross hurried into action in the season opening 36 31 loss at the dallas###cowboys when prince amukamara collided with safety ryan mundy and sustained a concussion . ross held up well against tony###romo , the cowboys' elusive passer . we 're not looking for any kind of letdown , safety antrel###rolle said of the probable lineup###change . we 're looking for ross to play ball as he did against dallas . no matter the circumstances , the giants expressed###confidence they could defeat the panthers if they repeated the success they had last year against newton , the first player taken in the 2011 draft and one of the game 's most dynamic players . the giants held newton to 16 of 30 passing for 242 yards and intercepted him three times . although newton is difficult to tackle at 6 feet 5 inches and 245 pounds , the giants limited his effectiveness as a ball carrier by taking a double###digit lead . he rushed six times for 6 yards , including his team 's only touchdown . it came in the third quarter , after the visitors had built a 23 0 lead . it was a rare poor afternoon for newton , who became the only player in n.f.l . history to pass for more than , 000 yards , 045 ) and 40 touchdowns ( 41 ) while running for more than , 000 yards , 045 ) and 20 touchdowns ( 22 ) in his first 33 games . he passed for , 869 yards and rushed for 741 yards and 8 touchdowns last year , when he became the first quarterback to lead his team in rushing since donovan###mcnabb paced the philadelphia###eagles in . he is a special athlete , mundy said . he can bring the ball down and get 5 yards or he can get 70 yards . although the giants have only two sacks , defensive###end mathias###kiwanuka said he thought they could turn up the pressure against newton . everybody knows about his feet and when he escapes the pocket , that he can still look down the field and he can make people miss , kiwanuka said . so our job will be to push the pocket , get people up in his face and make sure we get him down on the ground . hakeem###nicks was given an excused absence from practice so he could attend to personal###matters . nicks was expected back for sunday 's game . ... coach tom###coughlin continued to keep focus on the game rather than on the death of his younger###brother , john , who will be buried tuesday . asked how his players had rallied around him , coughlin said let 's not go there , please . everybody 's working###hard to get where we want to be .
an american indian child being raised by her biological###father should not have been taken from her adoptive###parents , the supreme###court ruled tuesday , saying that a federal law devised to keep indian families together did not apply in the case . the 5 to 4 decision , which reversed a ruling by the south###carolina###supreme###court , found that the case represented an exception to the 1978 indian child###welfare###act , a federal law that made it more difficult for american indian children to be removed from their families . that landmark legislation effectively###ended the practice of taking indian children from their homes and placing them in boarding###schools and foster###care . the court 's majority held tuesday that the case , adoptive couple v . baby###girl , no . 12 399 , did not involve removing a child from an indian home because the girl 's father had relinquished his parental rights before the girl 's birth and her biological###mother had agreed to allow the south###carolina couple to adopt the girl . four months after the child 's birth , the father , dusten brown , a member of the cherokee tribe , changed his mind and sought custody of his daughter . he said he had not realized that his former fianc e was going to put the child up for adoption . the girl was in the process of being legally adopted by matt and melanie capobianco , a white couple who raised her for 27 months before south###carolina courts ruled in favor of mr . brown . the child , now nearly , has been living with mr . brown in oklahoma for the past year and a half . the state###courts found that both the capobianco family and mr . brown had provided the girl with safe , loving homes . the baby veronica case , named for the girl at the center of the dispute , has stirred powerful emotional###responses from child welfare groups , adoptive###parents and indian###tribes , all of whom have sought a clearer legal###standard of how the indian child###welfare###act should be applied when it appears to conflict with state law . in the baby veronica case , for instance , south###carolina law would have allowed the toddler to remain with the capobiancos , but that state 's courts found that mr . brown 's parental rights under the federal law trumped state law . the supreme###court###ruling however , decided the case along fairly###narrow lines . justice samuel a . alito jr . wrote for the court 's majority that the indian child###welfare###act does not apply where the indian parent never had custody of the indian child . instead , justice###alito wrote , the federal law was designed###primarily to counteract the unwarranted removal of indian children from indian families , not as part of a custody dispute in which an indian child 's adoption is voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non indian parent with sole custodial rights . justice###alito was joined in the majority###opinion by chief###justice john g . roberts jr . and justices anthony m . kennedy , clarence###thomas and stephen g . breyer . justices thomas and breyer concurred separately . justice sonia###sotomayor wrote the principal dissent , joined by justices ruth###bader###ginsburg and elena###kagan . justice antonin###scalia , who agreed in part with the dissent , wrote that the court 's majority###opinion needlessly demeans the rights of parenthood , and added this father wants to raise his daughter , and the statute amply protects his right to do so . there is no reason in law or policy to dilute that protection . mark d . fiddler , a lawyer for the capobianco family , said the adoptive###parents burst###into###tears of joy when the ruling was announced . they planned to return to the south###carolina###state court system , which mr . fiddler said needed to figure out how to ease veronica 's transition back to the capobiancos and address a pending adoption . but when , or even if , veronica will be sent back to the capobiancos is far from clear . this is his daughter , his whole life , john###nichols , one of mr . brown 's lawyers wrote in an e mail on tuesday . he will fight for her right to stay with her family . he loves her and she loves him , and he 'll do whatever it takes to keep his daughter . mr . brown said in a statement that he was very disappointed with the decision and that his daughter was part of a happy and loving extended###family . i would not want any other parent to be in this position , having to struggle this hard and this long for the right to raise their own child , he said . i have fought for my daughter and will continue to fight for her and her right to be raised by her family . family courts ordinarily base custody decisions on the best interests of the child before them . joan heifetz hollinger , a law professor at the university of california , berkeley , who filed a brief in support of the child 's interests , said that if the state###of###south###carolina holds a custody hearing for baby veronica that there would be strong presumption that the child 's best interests are to allow her to remain where she is , absent evidence of abuse###or###neglect by dad . if , however , the court resumes the original adoption proceeding , she said , the outcome is likely to be in favor of a return to the adoptive###parents .

florida and michigan will open the 2017 season in the cowboys classic in arlington , texas . the prime time game is scheduled for saturday , sept . 2 . it will be florida 's first regular###season , non conference game outside the sunshine###state since the gators lost at syracuse in . you do n't get these opportunities very often , florida athletic###director jeremy###foley said . our schedule has been pretty consistent through the years . we were presented this opportunity and just thought it was something that our fans would embrace , our program would embrace . it would give us great national visibility . obviously , a very difficult ballgame against a storied program that excites us . michigan will be the away team florida the home###team . game officials and replay crew will come from the big 12 conference . each school will receive , 000 tickets for the neutral###site###game at at t stadium , home to the nfl 's dallas###cowboys . the . 2 billion stadium opened in . it already hosted the super###bowl and is scheduled for the 2014 ncaa men 's final four and the first college###football national###championship under the new playoff###format in january . we are excited to make a return###trip to dallas for the cowboys classic against florida , michigan coach brady###hoke said . this is a great way to reach our fan###base in the south and to continue to expand our recruiting###efforts in the state of texas . our goal is to have as many michigan fans at the game as possible . this will be the third meeting between michigan and florida . both previous matchups came in bowl games . michigan won both a 38 30 victory in the 2003 outback###bowl and a 41 35 victory in the 2008 capital one bowl . florida has struggled to fill stands for home###games the last few years , especially in games against non conference###opponents aside from florida###state . so moving a home date to a neutral###site venue and guaranteeing a sellout and a significant payout made sense financially . this is a great###opportunity to expose the university of florida nationally , playing one of the greatest programs in the history of college###football , foley said . i think a tremendous trip for our fans . we just have n't done much of this , certainly as long as i 've been athletic###director . i think there are a lot of positives that come out of it .
new york saying the nfl###players###association is holding hgh testing hostage after more than two years of squabbling with the league , the top democrat on the house oversight###and###government###reform committee warned thursday that congress could get involved . in a statement emailed by his office to the associated press , rep . elijah###cummings of maryland said the union continues to disregard its promise to implement hgh testing . he added continuing to block hgh testing in this way essentially will force congress to intervene , which nobody wants . the oversight###committee held a hearing in december to take a look at the science behind blood tests for human###growth###hormone . hgh is a banned performance###enhancing###drug that is hard to detect and has been linked to health problems such as diabetes , cardiac dysfunction and arthritis . two full nfl seasons have passed and another is about to begin without a final###agreement on hgh since the august 2011 labor deal paved the way for testing . in his statement , cummings pointed to extraordinary concessions from the nfl , numerous###meetings with members of congress , and a parade of experts verifying the validity of hgh testing and said after two years of negotiations , the nflpa is now holding hgh testing hostage because of matters wholly unrelated to testing . the league says the main sticking###point right now is whether commissioner roger###goodell or someone he designates will continue to hear###appeals for violations other than a positive test . the nfl wants to keep that part of the drug policy in place , while the union would prefer a panel of arbitrators to hear###appeals that involve breaking a law or the demonstrated use of a performance enhancer without a positive test . hours before cummings weighed in , the man who oversees the nfl 's drug program said the union has buyer 's remorse about hgh testing . a union official retorted that the only thing the league cares about is power . the latest public back and forth featuring adolpho birch , the nfl senior###vice###president of labor policy and government###affairs , and george atallah , the nflpa assistant###executive director of external###affairs comes exactly two weeks before the first game of the 2013 regular###season . there is a chance it wo n't###happen this season , the nfl 's birch told the ap . i will also say there is a chance it will . i strongly hope that it does . i would have said the same thing last year . i would have said the same thing in october . noting that the union wants to change the appeals###process for certain types of cases , birch said if their interest is in advancing the interests of players who play clean , and reassuring the public we have competitive integrity , and restoring public###confidence ... we can get this done . if their interest is worrying about people who have broken the law , and how to protect them , then we 've got more of a problem . birch mentioned concessions he said the nfl has made during negotiations , including dropping its desire to increase suspensions for a second offense from eight games to 10 games . the union 's atallah said players have been asked to vote twice on whether to allow goodell to keep his appeal authority for violations of law , and two times the players have said , 'no . ' i do n't###expect the players' position to change on that , atallah said in a telephone interview . none of this stuff can move forward , none of the policy can change , without a vote . that 's how our constitution works . ( nflpa executive###director demaurice smith ) ca n't unilaterally agree to anything without taking it to a vote . earlier thursday , the nfl issued a statement from birch in which he said it is time for the nflpa to stop the delay tactics . he called the desire to change the appeals###process simply a case of buyer 's remorse , and an effort to renegotiate part of a long###term agreement that they have now decided they do n't like . atallah responded via his twitter###account , linking to a page on the nflpa website that contained his reply the only case of buyer 's remorse is the attached letter that the nfl agreed to weeks###ago . our signature is on it . sign it , like you agreed to , and we start drawing blood from players immediately . your refusal to sign it confirms that the only thing you care about is power . posted below his statement was what atallah said was the signature page with smith 's handwriting , but not goodell 's from the sides' agreement on how to carry out a population study . that would entail drawing blood from every player at training###camp in 2013 to determine what level of hgh would constitute a failed test . team###rosters must be reduced to the regular###season count of 53 by aug . 31 . the sooner they sign the population study letter , the sooner we can move forward , atallah told the ap . but time is running out .
chicago urban###meyer , the football###coach at ohio###state , stepped to the lectern at big ten media day wednesday and summed up his predicament succinctly . tough couple days , he said . for an event usually highlighted by buzzwords like excitement , two a days and potential , meyer 's afternoon was decidedly more somber . the way meyer runs his program has been scrutinized since aaron###hernandez was charged last month with the murder of odin lloyd . hernandez , a former new england patriots tight###end , had several brushes with the law at florida , where he played for meyer . critics have noted that 41 players from meyer 's 2008 florida team , which won the national###championship , were arrested during or after college . recently , concern has risen over player conduct at ohio###state . this week , meyer announced discipline for four buckeye players . running back carlos###hyde was suspended after he was investigated in connection with an assault case . the junior cornerback bradley roby did not attend media day after he was arrested on a battery charge . the freshman marcus baugh will not play in the team 's first game after he was charged with possession of fake identification and underage possession of alcohol . tim gardner , another freshman , will not be on the team this season after a charge of obstructing official police business . all of that meant meyer faced a series of questions wednesday about the pattern of behavior , personal###responsibility and his role in the episodes . at times , he sounded like a guidance###counselor as much as a football###coach . i think you always can do more , meyer said . i mean , that 's something you wake up every day with . meyer , for the most part , spoke calmly , dutifully and with a measure of introspection . asked what it was like to hear his name mentioned in discussions about hernandez , meyer paused before answering . it felt awful , meyer said . it was a sick feeling . your thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victims . every player 's situation , every recruit 's situation , it 's in the back of my mind . he seemed to vacillate between soul###searching about what he could have done differently and expressing frustration in his players who have had legal troubles . in the end you 've got to feel in your heart we 're doing the right thing , that we 're in the people business and we have to do what 's right by those people , meyer said . there 's never been one time that i thought that we did wrong by that person . now , sometimes i sit back and evaluate that we give too many second chances . that seems to be a big key , and that 's something i 'm going to continue to evaluate . he added , in defense of the ohio###state program the guys work too hard . to have a couple of knuckleheads make some decisions that reflect the entire program , it 's something that bothers me , bothers our staff , and we work very hard to avoid with our players . meyer , about to enter his second season as the buckeyes' coach , dominated the proceedings at a downtown chicago hotel . most of the other big ten coaches were asked to comment on his situation and to discuss what , if anything , coaches could do to ensure their players were good citizens . gary###andersen , the first year coach at wisconsin and a former meyer assistant at utah , acknowledged the difficulty meyer was facing . but andersen expressed###confidence in him . he 's a good person , good family man , and somebody i have great###respect for , andersen said . i think coach will handle it very fairly . of coaching college players , andersen said they 're never going to be perfect , but that does n't mean we should n't strive for that and educate them , help them grow from young###men to men . then you hope they make the right decisions . ohio###state quarterback braxton###miller also expressed###support for his coach . people are coming down on coach meyer , but i do n't really feel like that 's his responsibility or his fault , miller said . i feel like it was just college kid mistakes . in his introductory###remarks , meyer joined the chorus of the coaches who preceded and followed him , speaking of high hopes for the coming###season . but he was not afforded much of an opportunity to talk about football once the question###and###answer###session began . after 15 minutes with reporters in a large###ballroom and another 15 minutes in a more intimate###setting at an upstairs banquet###hall , meyer looked weary . after yet another question about player conduct , he said , i 'm going to move on and talk about the buckeyes . one of the best things that happens is in 12 days we move into a hotel , he added , referring to training###camp . we wake up every morning and go to work .
texas lawmakers got out of the kumbaya session alive , ducking most of the opportunities for bitter fights by ducking most of the issues that cause legislative fights to turn bitter . they did n't mess with immigration , abortion laws , voting###laws or school###vouchers issues that divide lawmakers along ideological###lines and make for contentious gatherings like the 2011 legislative###session . that peace might end . after the regular###session came to a close on monday , gov . rick###perry immediately called lawmakers back . he wants them to ratify redistricting maps drawn by federal###judges for use in the 2012 elections . and he has the power to add to the agenda as the 30 day special###session proceeds . the list of items he might add is almost as long as the line of lawmakers and other supplicants asking for additions . and that 's the measure of his power now that the regular###session has ended . the control of the agenda moves from the offices of the legislative leaders into the office of the executive###branch . that shift , along with a potential change in legislative math in the special###session , means that some of the people thwarted in the regular###session now have the upper hand , and that the back seat is full of people who had been in front . lt . gov . david###dewhurst , for instance , might get a chance to deliver some of the pelts he promised texas conservatives , including new limits on abortions and allowing concealed handguns on college###campuses . in a special###session , he 's pushing the senate to get rid of its so called two thirds rule , which requires approval from two thirds of the senators before something can come up for a vote . on partisan issues , it means democrats have enough votes to block the republican###majority . as you might imagine , that rule can be frustrating to the majority , though it sometimes provides cover for not taking votes they would rather not take . it has certainly been frustrating to mr . dewhurst , who blames the democrats for the absence of action on the issues he especially wanted to advance . a special###session plays to the disadvantage of other regular###session winners . that would include the democrats who could , should they wish , flaunt the lieutenant governor 's complaint as proof of their own value . they make up barely more than a third of each house of the legislature , and yet they have had outsize influence so far this year . the newly disadvantaged could also include a prominent###republican leader house speaker joe###straus . going into overtime on redistricting or other conservative red###meat issues could be especially difficult for the speaker , who managed his chamber with a coalition of republicans and democrats the same democrats who would have to be elbowed aside to get those conservative issues passed . for instance , during the session , the house stymied the redistricting effort , saying it would be happy to look at anything that had already been approved by the senate . that 's an insider 's way to kill a political bill a longstanding###tradition prevents either chamber from voting on the other chamber 's political map first . the house approves the senate map only after the upper chamber backs it , and vice versa . anything else would be a breach of protocol mr . straus and everyone else in that conversation understands that . but a special###session changes things . the map question is limited all the governor has asked is that lawmakers ratify maps drawn by federal###judges . real mapmaking is n't what he 's after . a simple up or down vote on the maps could be fast drawing new maps could raise the political stakes for everyone , especially in the house . it 's on the other issues that the pendulum could swing . republicans needed democrats during the session to pass a state###budget , a water plan and so on . without those issues in play , the majority does n't have to trade a vote on one thing for support on another . simple majorities , if they can put them together , are all that would be needed to settle some of those partisan questions . republicans can produce those simple majorities all by themselves , if they can settle their internal differences . and if the governor , with his power over the agenda , decides to add those issues to their to do list .

atlanta a clamorous football crowd can induce visiting squads into committing penalties by drowning out the signal calls . full throated basketball fans can nudge officiating in favor of the home###team . but in no sport can devotees more directly###influence the outcome than at a pga###tour event . such power can be exerted even if they are not present . all it takes is a television remote###control with rewind capabilities , a cursory knowledge of the rules and the phone###number to a given tournament 's host course . the tour permits anyone , even tv viewers , to submit evidence that a player might be guilty of an infraction often with improperly improving the ball 's lie that was not detected or reported by the player or others on the spot . one of the most prominent instances involved tiger###woods , whose illegal drop at the masters was spotted by a former rules official watching the tournament on television . woods received a two stroke penalty the next day . at the bmw championship last weekend , woods was assessed a two shot penalty after the second round when his ball moved###slightly as he removed debris behind the first green . this time , the informant was on the crew of pga###tour entertainment , the circuit 's###video production wing . the tour 's commissioner , tim finchem , expressed###concern tuesday about the format 's fairness , in part because some players , like woods , tend to be on tv more . speaking at east###lake###golf###club , the site of this week 's tour championship finale , finchem indicated that the tour 's policy###board would discuss amending the procedure by possibly limiting the scope of information considered before declaring a result official . all the other sports close their books quicker than we do , so to speak , said finchem , noting that he personally had no position on the matter . i do n't like it sometimes , he added . it feels awkward when it happens . yet he alluded to golf 's foundation of adherence to the letter of the law , which has long held that no transgression should go unpunished . the seven time tour winner peter###jacobsen , who now divides his time between the champions###tour and the tv announcers' booth , endorsed the status###quo tuesday , even though he said that woods unevenly bore the brunt of the custom . when we have fans calling in after watching it on tv , it only strengthens the rules of the game and how good we have to be , said jacobsen , who received the payne###stewart award , which recognizes sportsmanship , character and charitable###activities . i do n't###mind people calling in , said jacobsen , adding that integrity was one of the measuring sticks out here on tour . finchem pointed out that the field could be leveled for all players if technology advances to where a camera is aimed at every shot . at the same time , tournament offices might require a phone bank to answer all of the calls about potential violations . the commissioner mentioned other adjustments the policy###board might consider at its november meetings as the tour winds down . reducing the penalty for inadvertently signing an incorrect scoreboard , which traditionally calls for disqualification . the issue has become complicated with the advent of tv watchers reporting perceived infractions . toughening the penalty , generally at two strokes , for an individual 's slow play in the ongoing effort to accelerate the game 's pace . altering the points formula for the fedex###cup###playoffs , which culminate this weekend , to lessen the often drastic movement of players in the standings and to reward consistency during the long grind leading to it . we like volatility , finchem said , but it is too much volatility ? you want the season to mean a lot .

lincoln , neb . longtime nebraska football fans karen shelton and sue schrader arrived at memorial###stadium eager to show their support saturday for embattled coach bo###pelini . the sisters wore matching t shirts proclaiming i 'm a boliever . a couple of hours later they walked into a stadium where there have been 329 consecutive sellouts since . the words through these gates pass the greatest fans in college###football are etched above each entrance . the loyalty of cornhuskers fans was tested after 2 year old audio of pelini 's expletive filled rant against fans was leaked to the deadspin . com sports website on monday . in interviews with fans before the game against south###dakota###state , some were offended and said the tirade was a continuation of a pattern of bad###behavior by pelini . some took the forgive but wo n't###forget stance . others said they were n't insulted and pointed out pelini 's words were spoken at an emotional time and during what he thought was a private conversation . all 10 fans said the person who leaked the audio showed bad form . pelini apologized in a statement monday , again during the big ten coaches' teleconference on tuesday and in a letter to fans that was posted on the athletic###department 's website friday . university###administrators said wednesday they were putting the matter to rest . shelton , who has been attending games since the 1960s , said she did n't flinch after listening to the audio . gosh , we all make mistakes , shelton said . my biggest###thing has been , if people could read our minds , a lot of us would be in trouble . fans stood , clapped and cheered as usual during the team 's traditional entrance and pregame tunnel walk . the deadspin audio caught pelini , minutes after a 34 27 come from behind win over ohio###state in , speaking off air with husker sports network play###by###play###man greg sharpe and an athletic###department staff###member . pelini criticized people who left the stadium in the third quarter , when the huskers trailed by 21 points . pelini repeatedly used expletives while talking about fair weather fans and how the day was coming that he would be gone and he wondered how the team will fare without him . he also used profanity while criticizing two omaha###world###herald sports writers . i still think he 's a good coach , schrader said . it 's too bad that it came out , but in my estimation , it was somebody who wanted to ruin him and i think it was to ruin his career . they 're too cowardly to come forward , which is pathetic . tim lippincott of papillion , who has had season###tickets for five years , said pelini 's rant caught his attention but he was n't insulted . he said he was surprised pelini had such a negative###attitude after his team made the biggest###comeback in program history to beat the buckeyes . i would think he would be so darn high about , 'my , gosh , look what our guys did , ' lippincott said . whether the rant stays in fans' memories depends mostly on how pelini 's team fares this season . if we win around here , you can about do anything , lippincott said . i hate to say that , but as long as you 're not doing anything illegal , if you win , you can forgive a lot of things . pelini 's temper has been a topic###of###conversation in these parts since , when he was nebraska 's defensive###coordinator and tried to confront kansas###state coach bill snyder for running up the score after a 38 9 loss . since he returned to nebraska as head###coach in , he 's had a number of memorable sideline blowups caught by tv cameras . brian rank of omaha said he has no problem with pelini 's job###performance but was offended by the audio . i 'm a firm believer in the fact everyone can make a mistake and should be forgiven , rank said . my concern is there is a pattern . the guy is a hot###head . we all knew that . we thought we kind of liked that . now it seems we 're realizing that hot headedness does n't###match with nebraska values . j.r . durbin of louisville said he 's sure many passionate###fans have used the same language as pelini when expressing displeasure with the coach , his assistants and players . durbin 's wife , linda , said it 's the kids we support and she and her husband will always be husker fans . he 's a great###man . he 's a good coach , linda durbin said of pelini . everybody has things they regret . done deal . over and done with .
imagine taking a 10 story###building , launching it , angling it so that it shifts 330 feet to the side as it rises 820 feet into the air and then landing it on the same spot it started . that is essentially what the rocket scientists at space###exploration technologies corporation , the company commonly known as spacex , did on tuesday in their latest###effort to develop a rocket that can be used again and again . currently rockets are used just once , with the first stage disintegrating as it falls back to earth . this bothers elon###musk , the chief###executive of spacex , who likens it to building a , flying it cross###country and then throwing it away . a reusable rocket would make it less expensive to get to orbit , but generating the energy needed to lift off from earth and accelerate to , 500 miles###per###hour the speed needed to stay in orbit is a major challenge . nasa 's space###shuttles partially solved that problem with reusable orbiters and rocket###boosters , but the result was so complicated and fragile that it ended up costing more money than throwaway rockets would have . in , on the first two flights of its falcon 9 rocket , spacex attempted to use parachutes to recover the first stage , without success . mr . musk then changed strategies . instead of parachutes , the rocket engines on the first stage would fire again after separating from the second stage , and the first stage would fly back to the launching###pad . to execute this strategy , spacex built a test vehicle called the grasshopper , which it started testing late last year , with each flight a bit higher and more challenging than the last . the latest flight demonstrated more pronounced steering maneuvers in moving to the side . the launching took place at spacex 's testing###site in central###texas . it was reminiscent of flights two decades###ago of an earlier reusable spacecraft called the delta clipper experimental , or dc x , which was built by mcdonnell###douglas . first financed by the defense###department , for servicing of orbiting###space weapons , and then by nasa , the dc x made a dozen flights between 1993 and . a landing strut failure and a fire on the last flight badly###damaged the rocket , and nasa decided not to build another . veterans from that program are gathering in new mexico this weekend for a conference commemorating the 20th anniversary of the first dc x flight . spacex is still a long way from what it needs for a practical reusable rocket . on a falcon 9 flight , the first stage separates at an altitude of about 50 miles , hundreds of miles from the launching###pad while traveling thousands of miles###per###hour . the first stage would have to slow down , turn around , re enter the lower atmosphere and retrace its trajectory before setting back down .
los###angeles ucla coach jim###mora and the 16th ranked bruins returned to football practice on monday for the first time since the death of walk on receiver nick pasquale . the team practiced in preparation for this weekend 's game at no . 23 nebraska . pasquale was hit by a car and killed while walking in his hometown of san###clemente on sunday . the 20 year old receiver played in the final offensive series in ucla 's season opening victory over nevada on aug . 31 . the bruins were off last weekend and pasquale had gone home to visit his family . it 's a very tragic time , a very difficult time , said mora , who has a son close to pasquale 's age . the coach hailed pasquale for being more than a player on the scout team . he was a kid who epitomized everything that you 're looking for in a football###player , from his spirit , his selfless work ethic , his commitment to the team , his toughness , mora told a group of reporters . mora spent time with the freshman 's family on sunday in san###clemente , where hundreds of pasquale 's friends , family members and fellow football players gathered at the high###school 's field for a vigil . pasquale 's older###brother , a.j. , played at the high###school , where his father mel pasquale is director###of###football###operations . our thoughts and prayers are with his family , that 's the most important###thing , mora said . he later told###reporters , every day we honor nick and his family . the way we do that is the way we play . it 's not about wins and losses . mora said he was happy that pasquale got into the season opening victory . by us getting the lead that we did because of the fine work of some starters , guys like nick , whose dream was to always play for ucla , got a chance to run out on the rose bowl field and play in front of his parents , the coach said . that 's something his parents will have forever . mora closed all practices this week to the media , and ucla players were n't made available for comment . our players are dealing with it each in their own way , he said . we think that 's the right way to do it . the important###thing is they 're together . this is a very close team and they care desperately about each other . nebraska coach bo###pelini said the university 's thoughts and prayers were with pasquale , his family , and ucla . that 's a lot bigger than any football game , he said . obviously , this has got to be a very difficult time for them . the bruins will wear a no . 36 patch on their jerseys the rest of the season . mora said nebraska 's players will have a sticker with pasquale 's number on their helmets and there will be a moment of silence before saturday 's road game in his honor . grief counselors were made available to the team on monday . i 'm not sure that all of them know how to process their emotions yet , so i just think it 's important we give them time to do that , mora told a group of reporters . pasquale was walking in the early###morning###hours on sunday along a street when he was hit by a car , according to the orange###county coroner 's office . the driver stayed at the scene and was not charged with any crime or infraction , said lt . jeff hallock of the orange###county sheriff 's department . no drugs or alcohol have been found to have been factors for the driver , hallock said . an autopsy report and later toxicology information will determine factors for the pedestrian . after starting to say that pasquale had only played a few plays , mora stopped mid###sentence during a monday news conference when a video reporter in the back of the room began###talking at the same time . mora told him shut up before the reporter , who had been obscured by a potted###plant that he was standing behind , emerged and motioned for the coach to continue talking . mora grew angry and chastised the reporter for displaying a lack of respect . the reporter apologized . mora got up , told the gathering , i got nothing to say , grabbed his backpack and left the room . he met later with a group of reporters .
rio de janeiro spain won by a landslide as expected but tiny tahiti emerged with their reputations enhanced and their dignity intact despite their 10 0 loss to the world and european###champions in the confederations###cup on thursday . fernando###torres scored four times , and missed a penalty , david###villa hit three , david###silva two and juan###mata one as spain scored double###figures for the third time in their history . the outcome of one of the most unlikely matches ever to take place in a senior fifa competition was never in doubt and even tahiti coach eddy etaeta said before the game his side 's chances of winning were quite impossible . despite the hammering , tahiti played some attractive attacking###football against a second string spain side that still contained some of the biggest###names in european###football including juan###mata , sergio###ramos and pepe###reina . tahiti 's first ever meeting with european opposition was more of an occasion than a match in many respects , and the fans created a superb atmosphere in the newly###refurbished maracana , the venue for next year 's world###cup final . they cheered every tahiti pass and tackle and roundly booed spain . two of the loudest cheers were for two fine###saves made by 20 year old tahiti goalkeeper mikael roche midway through the second half with his side already 7 0 down . the first goal arrived after only five minutes when torres scored in the huge###gap which roche left between himself and the near post . tahiti kept spain at bay for the next 26 minutes and weaved some neat passing moves together with teheivarii ludivon providing some of the best distribution for his side . but they were unable to make any real impact on the spanish defence apart from a fine angled shot from ricky aitamai just before half time . by then spain were already well in control and leading 4 0 with silva , torres and villa all finding the target in an eight minute spell . but despite spain 's obvious superiority against the oceania champions , who are ranked 138th in the world , the amateurs from the south pacific never stopped trying to play football to the delight of the , 000 plus crowd . spain midfielder santi###cazorla even earned himself a booking for a clumsy challenge in the first half , which ended with the crowd###cheering tahiti off . spain flexed their muscles after the break with villa adding two more and torres one in the first 15 minutes of the second half before mata made it eight when he got a lucky deflection after a one two with david###silva . torres then missed a penalty after 78 minutes , prompted a huge cheer from the crowd , but got his fourth###goal and spain 's ninth a minute later when he rounded roche to score . silva made it double###figures in the 89th minute after another move that slit open the tahiti defence .
jersey###city , n.j . kevin###stadler teed off just after breakfast and finished right before dinner . it took him nearly 11 hours to complete a 7 under 64 at liberty national , his lowest###score on the pga###tour since the first week of february . and he still is n't guaranteed to be the first round leader at the barclays . the fedex###cup###playoffs got off to a soggy start thursday with two rain delays that lasted six hours . it was a start again , stop again day on the bank of the hudson###river , but that did n't###stop stadler . he ran off three birdies early , then returned from the second delay and threw in four more birdies on a soft golf course . asked if it was difficult to stay mentally prepared , stadler replied , i 'm never really mentally prepared . same as usual . it was all good . tiger###woods , the no . 1 player in the world and in this playoff###series , came out of the first delay by missing a short birdie###putt on the par 5 13th and then rolling in three straight birdies to get into the mix . he cooled slightly after the slightly###longer second delay , and failed to make birdie on any of the par 5s in his round of . woods did n't###mind the long day . he was more concerned about the next long day on the horizon . only the top half of the draw finished the round . the later starters ben###crane played only two holes were to resume the round friday###morning and then go straight to the second round . that left the top half facing extra holes on saturday to get the tournament caught up . we 're done , woods said . it was a long day , and tomorrow will be a short one . and then saturday will be pretty much a marathon . british###open champion phil###mickelson and masters champion adam scott were among those who did n't###finish . pga champion jason dufner had a , while u.s . open###champion justin###rose recovered from a double###bogey on the par 5 13th for a . camilo###villegas , who started the season with conditional status and is no . 110 in the fedex###cup###standings , ran off four straight birdies around the turn and was the only player to reach 8 under for now until back to back bogeys late in his round . he had a , along with henrik###stenson and ryan###palmer . three breakfasts , three warm###ups , two lunches and a bunch of birdies , which is good , villegas said . jason day and matt###kuchar shot . day made two bogeys that kept a good round from getting away from him . his ball dropped over the rocks and into the water to the left of the fifth green , and he got up and down from there . on his closing hole , the par 4 ninth , his drive went deep into the bushes and forced him to take a penalty drop . he got onto the green and made another bogey . the rain allowed for some low scoring at liberty national , which hosted the barclays in 2009 and produced a winning score of 9 under . the course also went through significant changes to soften some of the landing###zones and green complexes . plus , there is virtually no rough . nothing allows for low scoring quite like soft conditions , however . nearly half of those who finished their rounds shot in the 60s . that group might have included rory###mcilroy , except for a few loose swings . he had three double bogeys and still managed a . mcilroy blasted out of a bunker and over the 15th green . his approach found the water on no . 5 . and his tee###shot on the ninth took a wicked kick off the cart path , over the bushes and a fence and out of bounds . the rest of it was actually pretty good , he said . stadler needed a good start . he has n't had a top 10 since new orleans in late###april , and he started these playoffs at no . 87 . only the top 100 advance to the second tournament next week outside boston , and the top 70 from there go on to the third event in chicago . i 've had a pretty lousy summer , but really started hitting the ball a lot better a couple of weeks###ago and was looking forward to playing some golf again here recently , he said . finally got something out of it today . stadler has not played in any of the world golf championship and only one of the majors the pga###championship , where he missed the cut so this event feels like a big one . it also happens to have arguably the strongest and deepest field on the pga###tour , particularly since everyone earned a spot based on this year 's play . all those guys are here this week , so in that regard , it 's pretty###cool , he said . but it 's just another week . stenson last year started the fedex###cup###playoffs at no . 117 and was gone after one week . he is one of the hottest players in golf , having been runner up at the british###open , the bridgestone###invitational and he was third at the pga###championship . he is no . 9 in the standings this year , and his 65 on a long thursday showed why . i came in from europe on monday###night , so i 'm a bit jet lagged and i only saw the course once , stenson said . i 'm very pleased with the way i played out there and took advantage of some good shots . and it was a little bit of a shaky finish . he missed a short par###putt on the par 5 eighth hole and had to make a 6 footer for par on the last . got some good practice of night golf , because that 's what we are going to have tomorrow###night when we start our second round , i guess , he said .
washington president###obama on friday plans to announce the nomination of james b . comey , a senior justice###department official under president george w . bush , to become the next director of the f.b.i. , according to white###house officials . the senate , which will not be in session in august , is bracing for a significant fight over nominations in july , and it is not clear whether the administration has allotted enough time for the senate to confirm him by sept . 3 , when robert s . mueller iii , the f.b.i . director , is mandated to leave his post . f.b.i . officials in washington had expressed###concern that if mr . obama did not nominate a new director by the beginning of june , the bureau would probably have an interim###director for some time . mr . comey is best known for his role in a 2004 incident in which , as the acting united###states###attorney###general , he refused to acquiesce to aides to mr . bush , who wanted mr . comey to reauthorize a controversial national###security###agency surveillance program . the program was ultimately reauthorized , but under a different legal###framework . as part of mr . comey 's confirmation , he is expected to be questioned about his views on that program and the ones that have been disclosed in recent weeks . among the factors mr . obama considered , one of the white###house officials said , was that the f.b.i . has been transforming into a domestic###intelligence agency bent on detecting plots and preventing terrorist attacks rather than just solving###crimes . one option would have been to put an intelligence professional in the position , but mr . obama decided he wanted to select someone with strong###ties to the department of justice and its culture . he felt it was important that the f.b.i . stay tethered to the justice###department , and in particular the fealty and , frankly , obligation of the department and by extension the f.b.i . to uphold the rule of law , the official said .
madrid###spain 's 3 0 reverse to brazil in the confederations###cup final was a mere blip and they will be back in brazil next year confidently chasing a second straight world###cup triumph , according to forward fernando###torres . the spanish had a miserable night at a festive maracana stadium on sunday , as sergio###ramos missed a second half penalty and gerard pique was sent off with just over 20 minutes left for bringing down his new barcelona team###mate neymar . the defeat ended spain 's record run of 29 unbeaten competitive###matches going back to a 1 0 loss to switzerland at the 2010 world###cup and torres said it served as a useful reminder that you ca n't###win all the time . everybody thinks that spain should win every match and reach every final but it 's not as easy as that , the chelsea striker , who won the tournament 's golden###shoe award , said on fifa . com . this team does n't need a wake up call , nor do we need a defeat to regain our motivation , he added . if there is something positive to be taken from the match , it 's this it 's confirmed something that we already knew , that it 's not going to be easy to beat brazil on their own patch . that said , in one year 's time we 'll be back here as world###champions to defend what 's ours . sunday 's match in rio de janeiro turned in the 41 st minute when brazil centre back david###luiz slid in to conjure an incredible goal###line clearance and deny pedro an equaliser . three minutes later , neymar , voted player of the tournament , smashed a left###foot drive past iker###casillas and when fred netted his second of the night and brazil 's third early in the second period , there was no way back for spain . we must congratulate brazil because they showed that they know how to play against spain , ramos told###reporters . we have won a lot of important titles and one day , the moment has to arrive when you do n't###win , the real###madrid defender added . we are n't machines . our conscience is clear because we gave the best we had . spain top european world###cup###qualification group i by a point from france after five matches and play their remaining three games away to finland in september and at home to belarus and georgia in october . securing a place at next year 's finals should be a formality and torres said the players were already looking forward to another crack at brazil . football is great for that , because you always get another chance , he said . one year from now , hopefully we 'll be here and have a chance to make up for today , not necessarily to gain###revenge on brazil , but for our own sake . we 're world###champions and two time european###champions and have achieved something that no other team has ever done won three major###tournaments in a row . next year we 're coming over here to make it four .
chicago alex###rodriguez sat in the far corner of the yankees clubhouse monday###afternoon , staring at a computer screen displaying video images of chicago###white###sox pitcher jose quintana , whom he would soon be facing . a mere 30 minutes had passed since major###league###baseball had announced rodriguez was being suspended for 211 games in connection with its months long doping investigation , but rodriguez , the 38 year old third baseman , appeared unfazed . behind him stood dozens of reporters , most sent specifically to observe and record rodriguez 's every move on a day when he was simultaneously handed the largest doping penalty in baseball history while incongruously preparing for his first game of the season . as rodriguez casually chatted with a bystander hours before the yankees' 8 1 loss to the white###sox , derek###jeter walked###past and said , how 's it going , man ? as if it were any other day . but it was far from that . it was one of the most unusual days in recent baseball history , even for a lightning###rod player like rodriguez . he had spent the first four months of the baseball season recovering from hip###surgery and watching while baseball investigated his ties to an anti###aging clinic in south###florida suspected of distributing performance###enhancing###drugs . and then on monday , baseball pounced , suspending rodriguez and 12 other players as the result of its investigation but with only rodriguez drawing more than a 50 game ban . in turn , only rodriguez decided to appeal , a process that may allow him to play right through the end of the regular###season and even into october , should the injury battered yankees somehow find a way to grab a playoff###spot . that is fine with rodriguez , who in a pregame news conference with more than 100 members of the news###media declined to directly answer###questions about drug use but said he was intent on sticking up for his rights and playing###baseball . i 'm fighting for my life , he said . i have to defend myself . if i do n't###defend myself , no one will . still , while he was composed in the clubhouse , there were times in his measured opening###statement when he seemed to put on a display of emotions . he called the last seven months of his life , since reports first tied him to the clinic , a nightmare . and yet , in another part of the news conference , he said he felt like a teenager because of the sheer joy of being able to get back on the field . i am thrilled and humbled to have the opportunity to put this uniform on again and play major###league###baseball again , he said . i feel like i was 18 years old , back in fenway###park in 1994 when i went in to face the red###sox for the very first time . it 's been 20 years and i 'm just very excited to have the opportunity to go out there and play baseball and help my team win . by the time rodriguez stepped to the plate two and a half###hours later for his first at bat of the season , the yankees needed help . it was the top of the second and they were already trailing , 3 0 . amid a backdrop of sustained booing nothing rodriguez has n't###heard before during the course of his controversial career he hit a bloop single to left . he went 1 for , and by the time he came to bat in the eighth , the boos had transformed into chants of a roid , a roid . it 's been crazy , rodriguez said . but from this point on , i 'm going to do my very best to focus on baseball . every game is very important . it was good to get the first one behind me , even though it was n't a win . rodriguez 's debut began hours after the announcement he had been suspended through the 2014 season , beginning thursday , on grounds he had both used performance enhancers and attempted to thwart baseball 's inquiry . rodriguez , with the full backing of the players union , is planning to appeal the ruling through baseball 's arbitrator , a process that could take as long as three months or more to conclude , according to michael weiner , the union 's executive###director . weiner said the penalty was way out of line , and he said the union agreed with rodriguez 's decision to appeal . in , rodriguez admitted to using steroids years###earlier when he was with the texas###rangers . in this instance , he was less forthcoming . asked if he had used performance enhancers in the much more recent period outlined in baseball 's investigation , he declined to answer yes or no . we 'll have a forum to discuss all of that and we 'll talk about it then , he said , in an apparent reference to the appeals###process . rodriguez was also vague about his relationship with the yankees , which has gone from cool to testy to outright combative in recent weeks . rodriguez has made indirect accusations that the yankees were involved in baseball 's investigation as a way to escape their immense financial###commitment to him . he is owed roughly 95 million through . rodriguez has also insinuated that he has not received adequate care from the yankees' medical###staff . both charges have angered the yankees , who issued a statement monday challenging them . the new york yankees in no way instituted and or assisted m.l.b . in the direction of this investigation or used the investigation as an attempt to avoid its responsibilities under a player contract or did its medical###staff fail to provide the appropriate standard of care to alex###rodriguez , the statement###read in part . but despite this mutual antagonism , the yankees can use any help rodriguez can provide . even as he returned to the lineup , jeter , the team captain , was going back on the disabled###list for a third time with more leg troubles . he has been unable to stay on the field this season , and now he will watch as rodriguez tries to play , one more twist in a bizarre and nightmarish season no yankee could have anticipated .

boston for cardinals fans , it was a depressing sight with their team already trailing the red###sox in the second inning of game , carlos beltran , st . louis 's switch hitting star , was clutching his ribs in pain . he had just crashed into the short bullpen wall while saving his team the indignity of allowing a grand###slam to boston 's david###ortiz . beltran was found to have a right rib contusion and was taken to a hospital for further examination . but on thursday , he was in the lineup for game , batting second and giving the cardinals hope . it shows you how bad he wants to play , john###mozeliak , the cardinals' general###manager , said . it took him so long to get to the world###series , and in the second inning , to be taken out of a game , obviously he was disappointed . i know he 's worked very hard over the last 20 hours to get to this point . asked what beltran had done in the previous 20 hours , mozeliak said , they 've been giving him any medical care they can in trying to push him through this . for the cardinals to even the series , they needed a productive beltran . entering the world###series , he had driven in 12 runs in 11 postseason###games . in the national###league###championship###series , he drove in all three runs in a 3 2 win over the dodgers in game , then went 3 for 4 in the series###clinching game . the rib###injury was likely to limit beltran 's ability to swing effectively , mozeliak indicated . but beltran took batting practice , and he was deemed able to play . you could obviously tell that carlos was in some pain , cardinals outfielder jon###jay said , but hopefully he can be able to contribute . mozeliak said , right now , he says he feels good . buchholz's stiff shoulder one of the top talents in the red###sox' rotation , clay###buchholz , will probably only make one start this world###series , if he pitches at all . he revealed wednesday###night that he had been bothered by stiffness in his pitching shoulder . manager john###farrell said he would give buchholz as much time as he could , but he also indicated buchholz would start game 4 on sunday in st . louis . we fully expect him to go , farrell said thursday . buchholz missed three months of the season with neck and shoulder problems , and he returned for four september starts . he pitched well , but in the postseason , against tampa###bay and detroit , he seemed to wear down late . his one start against the rays , in game , was the red###sox' only loss in the american###league###division###series . buchholz shut out the rays for four innings , then allowed three runs in the fifth . his two starts against the tigers in the american###league###championship###series , in games 2 and , followed a similar pattern in each game , he pitched well until the hitters got to him in the sixth . boston won both games . if buchholz cannot pitch game , the left hander felix doubront might start . doubront posted a . 32 earned###run###average in 27 starts this season but was used as a reliever in the a.l.c.s . rivera honored at series the yankees did not make the postseason for the first time since , but mariano###rivera found himself at center stage again . before game , commissioner bud###selig presented the newly retired rivera with the commissioner 's historic achievement###award . rivera , in a light mood , joked that he had decided not to retire and would maybe try the national###league this time . ( he reiterated it was a joke . ) he also suggested he would stop by yankee spring###training next year , just to say hello . the award was last issued to ken###griffey###jr . in . other recipients included barry###bonds , roger###clemens , roberto###clemente , tony###gwynn , rickey###henderson , mark###mcgwire , cal###ripken###jr . , sammy###sosa , ichiro###suzuki and rachel robinson .
arguing that the federal defense###of###marriage###act imposes serious administrative and financial###costs on their operations , some of the nation 's largest###companies filed a supporting brief with the supreme###court on wednesday , urging it to overturn a section of the act that denies federal benefits and recognition to same sex couples . the brief drew 278 signers , including more than 200 companies among them giants like citigroup , apple , mars and alcoa as well as city governments , law###firms and other groups . in statements on wednesday , many declared their firm opposition to discrimination based on sexual###orientation . but the friend of the court brief focused more on the burdens imposed by the 1996 law on companies that offer benefits to same sex###spouses . the brief was one of many received by the court as it considered landmark###cases on gay###rights and marriage . with a wide###swath of leading###companies signing on , it is the latest sign of the rapid shift toward acceptance of same###sex###marriage in the corporate###world as well as in the country . recent###polls indicate that a majority of americans now agrees that same###sex###marriage should be legal . nine states plus the district of columbia have legalized gay###marriage and three more states recognize gay marriages performed elsewhere . prominent###republicans also announced they would also file a supreme###court brief in support of a suit seeking to strike down proposition , a california ballot###initiative barring same###sex###marriage , and all similar bans . in the brief , the signers said the federal law puts us , as employers , to unnecessary cost and administrative complexity . but the law also , the brief stated , forces us to treat one class of our lawfully married employees differently than another , when our success###depends upon the welfare and morale of all employees . for companies operating in the states where same###sex###marriage is legal , the ban on federal benefits under the law has proved a headache . contradictory marriage laws in different states have also complicated benefits and other programs of companies operating in multiple states . treating heterosexual and same sex married employees differently under federal law , the brief said , imposed high administrative###costs as companies maintained dual systems of tax withholding and payroll . it results in extra tax###burdens for both companies and employees with health plans , and can affect payments including retirement , pension and life###insurance as well as having a bad effect on morale . we feel it 's critical for the court to understand the burdens that this law imposes on both employers and employees , said james klein , president of the american benefits council in washington , whose members###include a broad cross###section of major###employers . doma is not just a piece of social###legislation , but it also has very practical costs for the business community and the people they employ . those signing the brief included major companies like walt###disney , starbucks , amazon , microsoft , levi###strauss , marriott###international and new york life , as well as smaller###firms like the u.s . balloon company in brooklyn and holdredge wines in california . the list also includes wall###street firms like blackrock , goldman###sachs and morgan###stanley . the brief was filed in support of united###states v . windsor , no . 12 307 , which challenged a part of doma that defined marriage as being only between a man and a woman for the purposes of more than , 000 federal###laws and programs . the case involved edith windsor of new york###city , who had married thea clara spyer in canada in . ms . spyer died in , leaving her property to ms . windsor . but the internal###revenue###service said that under doma , ms . windsor could not be treated as a surviving###spouse and she faced a large tax bill that a spouse in an opposite###sex marriage would not have to pay . ms . windsor sued and a federal###appeals###court struck down the 1996 law , the second time an appeals###court called this part of doma unconstitutional . the case is one of two now before the supreme###court concerning same###sex###marriage a second , involving proposition , is the subject of another amicus brief supported by some of the same corporations that signed the windsor brief . the court is expected to hear arguments on both cases in march . the windsor amicus brief , mainly drafted by sabin willett , a lawyer with bingham mccutchen in boston , outlined the costs imposed on both employers and employees when companies must maintain dual policies for those in same sex and opposite###sex marriages . but it also argues that the discrimination undermines their business performance . it 's , the face of the nation is changing and to be competitive , to win in business today , you need to change with the demographics of the nation , said bernadette harrigan , an assistant vice###president in the law department of the massachusetts mutual###life###insurance###company , one of the signers , who has been active on gay###rights issues . several companies , in statements issued wednesday , stressed their concerns about the impact of doma not only on costs but also on fairness . mars' decision to support the amicus brief was based on our belief that all married mars associates should be treated###equally under the law , said a statement from the candy maker . a johnson###johnson statement said we have joined the amicus brief because , as an employer , we believe that all lawfully married employees should be treated by our company in the same way . john holdredge , of holdredge wines in healdsburg , calif . , said in a telephone interview , we do n't want to have to ask employees about their orientation and we do n't want to have to discriminate .
new york new york jets rookie offensive###lineman oday aboushi , one of the few palestinian americans to play in the nfl , defended himself friday against a website 's article that called him a muslim extremist . aboushi was angered by the story , published tuesday by frontpage###magazine , as well other comments in response to the piece . it is upsetting to see people try and tarnish my reputation without even knowing me , he said in a statement issued by the team . but i appreciate all the support i have been getting from people of all backgrounds across the city and country . the brooklyn born aboushi , who now lives on staten###island , was drafted in the fifth round by the jets out of virginia . he is one of just a small handful of palestinian american players to enter the nfl , including former linebacker tarek saleh , former quarterback gibran hamdan , and former defensive###lineman nader abdallah . aboushi told the associated press in an interview in may that being a palestinian american in the nfl was an honor and added that for being able to kind of break that mold and sort of open the door for other people and show them that it is possible , it 's a great feeling . in the statement friday , aboushi again expressed pride in his culture , as well as in being born and raised in the united###states and having a chance to play in the nfl . as for the israeli###palestinian###conflict , he said , i hope that both sides make peace and live in prosperity . the story on frontpagemag . com said aboushi 's latest infraction came last month when he was in virginia and gave a speech at a radical muslim conference sponsored by a group denying israel 's right to exist and associated with blatantly anti###semitic and terrorist propaganda . the anti###defamation###league issued a statement in aboushi 's defense , saying there 's a lot of exaggeration and hyperbole in all the talk about the player . absolutely nothing in the public record suggests aboushi is anything other than a young###american athlete who takes pride in his palestinian heritage , adl director abraham h . foxman said . his participation in a conference organized by the el bireh society , a palestinian community organization that was until recently defunct , should not be used to tar him as an extremist . foxman added that being pro palestinian does not mean you 're an anti###semite or an extremist . ... the record simply does not show that aboushi has crossed that line . the jets , in a statement , said they strongly believe in diversity , inclusion and tolerance of others . while not directly###addressing the issues involving aboushi , the team added that we also encourage all of our employees to use good judgment when exercising their rights to freedom of expression and speech to be certain that they are constructive and respectful . the team reports for training###camp in cortland , n.y. , on july .

vienna any director who stages la###fanciulla###del###west has got to be tempted to tamper with its setting . puccini based his opera on david###belasco 's play , the girl of the golden###west , about the blossoming of true###love in a california mining town during the gold###rush , circa . yet golden or otherwise , the west is so deeply woven into the fabric of the opera that comparisons with western imagery is inevitable . there is a saloon where whiskey is drunk neat , a hero bandit who overcomes his deviant ways , a high###stakes###poker game and , finally , a ride into the proverbial sunset . for puccini admirers , fanciulla the first opera to have its world###premiere at the metropolitan###opera , in 1910 is a work of great musical richness but one eclipsed by the popularity of operas the composer wrote earlier . yet its story is constructed around a familiar operatic love###triangle . minnie , a woman who exists amidst a throng of miners , may lack the vulnerability of other puccini 's soprano heroines , but her love for the tenor , dick###johnson , redeems him from his criminal past , while the baritone , sheriff jack rance , lusts after her in vain . by rights , la###fanciulla###del###west ought to be accepted as readily as madama###butterfly and turandot , as an opera with an exotic setting reinforced by dabs of local###color , but its western details keep emerging as clich ridden distractions . it would be a fool 's errand to insist on downplaying them , but at least a production can avoid matching them with an equally clich ridden set . marco arturo marelli , in his generally persuasive new production at the vienna staatsoper , updates the action to roughly the present day yet keeps it securely rooted in the west . puccini 's saloon operates from a trailer wheeled into a three tiered encampment made of corrugated###metal , where miners not only carouse but also freshen up after the day 's work and hang out . a nostalgic song , which makes one of the minders homesick , is heard from a cassette player , yet sheriff rance wears a fancy black western shirt , and act 3 brings a panoramic view of an unmistakably western vista ( mr . marelli also designed the sets and lighting . no less a figure than the twelve tone master anton###webern in a letter to his mentor arnold###sch###nberg , extolled the score of fanciulla for its entirely original sound throughout brilliant , every bar a surprise . it is full of modernistic touches , which are worked into puccini 's overall style so skillfully that they might be overlooked . even debussy turns up as an influence ( puccini saw pell###as###et###m###lisande and was taken by it ) music based on whole tone scales is frequent . time and again you think you know what is coming harmonically , only to hear a chord of unexpected complexity instead . the americanisms built into the music are also appealing , including a cakewalk and a simple but infectious waltz that has the hint of a folk###song and accompanies minnie and dick###johnson 's first dance . the orchestration is brilliantly colorful . the staatsoper offers a glorious opportunity to hear the music . the orchestra ( whose members also constitute the vienna###philharmonic ) plays superbly under franz welser m st , who knows how to shield the voices from it yet lets it resound excitingly as the occasion demands . and the singers could hardly be better . nina###stemme , best known for her splendid wagnerian portrayals , shifts to minnie with ease . although curiously costumed ( by dagmar niefind ) she bounces in at her first entrance with red hair and overalls looking like raggedy###ann she soon has an arresting moment when , in teaching the miners about the bible , she becomes transfixed by the concept of forgiveness of sin , thereby foreshadowing the transformation of dick###johnson . ms . stemme goes on to chart the development of minnie 's character into a mature woman convincingly , and her voice rich and true sounds every bit as idiomatic in puccini 's music as it does in wagner 's . jonas###kaufmann , with ample experience balancing german roles with italian ones , sings dick with burnished tone that is possessed of both heft and ring . it is hard to imagine the waltz tune sung more ardently , and one admires the beauty and restraint , in lieu of grandstanding , that mr . kaufmann brings to the opera 's one distinct aria , ch'ella mi creda , sung as it appears he is about to be lynched . the character of jack rance is tricky , because his frustrated passion for minnie is so strong that it can deflect the emotional focus away from the lovers . first , rance loses a rigged poker game meant to decide minnie and dick 's fate , then he must watch helplessly as they achieve happiness together . tomasz konieczny sings strongly , with a snarl to the voice as appropriate , but mr . marelli errs centering on rance at the end , who points a gun to his head as if suicide is next . better to have the lovers simply sail off together , as they do literally here in a colorful hot###air###balloon . it must be mr . marelli 's way of acknowledging the hollywood like ending , but it is modest compared with nikolaus lehnhoff 's staging in amsterdam four ago ( to be seen at the paris###opera this season , which had a blond and glamorous minnie , dressed in a strapless gown , make her third act entrance descending a staircase while mgm 's roaring###lion was projected above . in any case , fanciulla will always summon visions of hollywood , and perhaps once in a while , if you ca n't###beat them , it may indeed make sense to join them .
norton , massachusetts canada 's graham###delaet is following the ice###hockey tradition of not shaving during the playoffs and the superstition appears to be working after he shot the week 's best round so far at the deutsche###bank###championship on sunday . delaet 's nine under 62 at tpc boston , coming after he bogeyed the first hole , left him at 16 under par for the tournament , just three strokes behind leader sergio garcia . a similar round on monday will secure his place on the internationals team for october 's presidents###cup in ohio and could even bring him his first pga###tour win . it would mean the world to me to be on that team , there 's no question , said delaet after sunday 's round . but at the same time when i 've been on the golf course i 've been focused on what i need to do and i 'm proud of the way i 've handled it because there is a lot of pressure on the outside . i 've been playing well so it 's easier to stay in the moment when you 're trusting your golf swing and making a few putts as well , he said . delaet missed the cut at the canadian open and the pga###championship but bounced back impressively at the barclays last week where he finished t2 after a final round . this week , with the 'playoff beard' even scragglier , delaet has shot rounds of , 68 and 62 at the par 71 course . last week definitely helped . sunday , i mean that was a tough golf course . the wind was up there and i was able to put together a nice round , he said . just coming in here this week i was really feeling good about the way i was hitting it and the way i was putting it . and especially when you can make a few putts early you can just get a little bit more confidence going . i just hope that i can have half that kind of day on monday , he said . delaet had a busy morning before his round , taking his wife to the airport for her trip to italy before being caught in the rainstorms while driving back on the highway . his 62 tied his career low and was just one stroke off the course record . if , as expected , delaet is named in the internationals team next week by captain nick###price , he will become just the second canadian following mike###weir to make the team . and for another few weeks at least , the beard is staying . i 'm canadian , that 's what we do in the playoffs , you do n't shave until you 're done , he laughed .
the united###states now ranks 11th in the world in cases of plague , according to a new survey of the disease . with 57 cases in a decade , it is far below the hardest hit countries , congo with , 581 and madagascar with , 182 . still , it is the only wealthy country on the list 97 percent of cases are in africa . the survey was published monday by the american journal of tropical###medicine and hygiene . the black###death killed a third of europe in the 14th century , but cases are no longer found there , probably because cities keep rat populations down , said the author , dr . thomas c . butler , a plague expert at ross university medical###school in the west###indies . by contrast , in the american###southwest , the bacteria have shifted into rural squirrels and prairie dogs . most cases come from flea bites , but in the united###states a national###parks biologist died after inhaling the bacteria while doing a necropsy of a mountain###lion , and a 60 year old geneticist in chicago died , apparently after being careless with a research strain he believed was safe . the biggest outbreaks were among gold and diamond miners in congo . outbreaks were also traced to infected camel meat one animal in afghanistan infected 83 people . a 2009 outbreak among herdsmen in china was unusual because it was traced to infected dogs , who had been thought to be plague resistant . diagnoses can now be done with a rapid dipstick test and a vaccine may be available within a decade , dr . butler said . donald g . mcneil jr .
the anxiety arrived first , when the sun was still high above the ballpark matt###harvey , who was in the midst of another pitching gem , left the game before the start of the eighth###inning , pointing to his right hip as he ducked into the mets' clubhouse for treatment . it was the sort of sight that can make the score seem insignificant . yet as afternoon oozed into night , a resolution to the game stubbornly would not come . inning after inning , the mets and the miami###marlins the major###leagues' two worst clubs in batting###average looked incapable of summoning just one more run to break a 1 1 deadlock . the marlins finally did , notching a 2 1 win , but only after 20 excruciating and increasingly absurd innings . through their joint ineptitude , the teams produced the longest###game at citi###field and the longest involving the mets since they beat the st . louis###cardinals in 20 innings three years###ago . in , the mets lost to the cardinals in 25 innings . the latest marathon was a crushing loss for the mets , who until recently could at least claim that they were not the worst###team in the national###league###east . that characterization seems arguable now . the mets ( 23 34 ) have lost four straight###games against the division rival marlins , who have 17 wins this year , 7 against the mets . i wish i had an explanation , manager terry###collins said of the mets' futility . we 're not getting it done . that 's the bottom line . we 're not doing the things that got a lot of us to the big###leagues . amid such desolation , any layoff for harvey , 24 , would be demoralizing for the team . he pitched###seven###innings saturday , allowing six hits and striking out six batters without a walk , and he lowered his earned###run###average to . 10 . i mean , my goodness gracious , collins said . if there 's anybody right now we do n't need hurt , it 's matt###harvey . the crowd was officially###announced as , 338 , but it felt as quiet as a zen garden when harvey was being checked on the mound . as he left the field , he received a hesitant round of applause . after the game , harvey said he felt tightness around his right hip that dissipated as soon as he received treatment around the joint . collins said the team would take every precaution not to aggravate the injury , but harvey played down any concerns . everything 's fine , and i 'll be ready to go for my next start , harvey said . the remaining fans watched as the mets squandered one chance after another , finding new ways each time to fail . they put a runner in scoring###position in 8 of the last 12 innings but failed to push across the winning###run . over all , they went 0 for 19 with runners in scoring###position , a franchise###record . a sort of relief swept through the ballpark long after the last slivers of sunlight had disappeared . in the top of the 20th inning , shaun###marcum , the mets' eighth pitcher , threw an outside cutter that adeiny###hechavarria slapped into left###field for a run###scoring single . the crowd let out a halfhearted mixture of boos and cheers . marcum , usually a starter , did not expect to pitch when he arrived at the ballpark . hours later , he was dueling kevin###slowey , the marlins' seventh pitcher , into the early###evening . marcum pitched eight innings in all , allowing five hits and one run . strangely , it was his longest and possibly best outing of the year . not expecting to pitch or pitch that long , it was definitely different , said marcum , who fell to . but on the other hand , sometimes guys pitch better that way . when you 're not expecting to pitch , you do n't think as much . the game , then , featured two pitching duels . the first pitted harvey against jose fernandez , a 20 year old right hander . harvey was trying to bounce back from a subpar outing against the marlins last sunday , and he was hot from the start , firing 98 mile an hour fastballs as he retired 10 of the first 11 batters he faced . fernandez , a bright###orange glove on his left###hand , could not match harvey 's early tidiness , but he was effective . he lasted six innings , struck out seven mets and allowed one run . ike###davis , batting sixth for the mets , drew a walk from fernandez to start the second inning . one out later , davis was galloping home from first base on juan lagares 's double to left###field , his helmet falling off somewhere near third . harvey 's one slip up came during the fourth , when he gave up consecutive one out singles . he then let chris###coghlan float a ball to right field for a sacrifice###fly that tied the score at . harvey grew###stronger from there . during the sixth , he hit 99 m.p.h . three times . but he felt a tug after throwing his last pitch of the seventh , and the mets were not going to take any chances . it 's frustrating coming out of the game when you 're finally starting to get into a rhythm , harvey said . for mets fans watching the action against baseball 's worst###team , the six and a half###hour struggle was probably just as frustrating . the mets said they would designate outfielder rick###ankiel for assignment before sunday 's game . kirk nieuwenhuis was to be recalled to the majors to take his place .
miami the new york yankees and premier###league###club manchester###city have formed a major###league###soccer ( mls ) team to play in new york###city from , aiming to win over america 's largest sports market to the global game . city , owned by sheikh###mansour of abu###dhabi , will be the majority partner in new york###city football###club with the biggest name in baseball , the yankees , as a minority###partner active in running the team . new york###city has been without a top professional soccer team since the demise in the mid 1980s of the old cosmos , which featured soccer greats like brazil 's pele and germany 's franz###beckenbauer . while the new###york###red###bulls are based in harrison , new jersey , mls has long coveted a chance to get inside the five boroughs of the city itself . this is another big day for soccer in america , mls commissioner don###garber told###reuters . we have worked for quite some time on trying to finalize a deal to bring the 20th mls team to new york###city . two of the biggest , most prestigious and clearly most respected sports organizations in the world are joining together to own this team , he added . mls has steadily grown since its formation in 1996 with successful , well supported teams in city 's such as los###angeles and seattle . but it has failed to attract large television audiences and the league hopes a new york team will change that . garber said mls viewed a top flight team in new york###city itself as a defining###moment for the league . this is a big market and represents over 19 million people , he said . i think it will be transformational for mls and for soccer in america . this country is rapidly becoming a very powerful and passionate soccer nation and it is our view that bringing together these two organizations will allow us to continue that tremendous momentum and bring it arguably to the most important city in the entire###world , he added . manchester###city , who won the premier###league in the 2011 12 season before finishing second to local###rivals united this year , hope the yankees will allow them to tap into expertise in reaching sports fans in new york . this is the best of both worlds we believe we know how to manage a soccer###club and the yankees are a top sports organization in the world and are true new yorkers , manchester###city chief###executive ferran soriano told###reuters . we have a long###term###plan for soccer in new york and there could n't be a better partner , he said . while city have been working on the details of an mls franchise for nine months , yankees president randy levine said his organisation only joined the process very , very recently . we are really excited . george###steinbrenner , the boss , and the steinbrenner family , ( owners ) hal and hank steinbrenner , have long been soccer fans , levine told###reuters . this is a phenomenal opportunity for us , in our home###market , to partner with manchester###city , one of the great organizations in the world , he added . the new team will play at a temporary home in 2015 while efforts to find and build a new stadium are completed and levine said yankee###stadium was one option in the meantime . sheikh###mansour 's wealth and the yankees local contacts should help in the construction of a new stadium . mls has already begun discussions with the city of new york about the possibility of building a new stadium in flushing###meadows###corona###park in queens but other options will also now be looked at . i do n't think there have been any setbacks ( with flushing###meadows ) and i think clearly that is an option , said levine . we just got into this and we are going to sit down with our partners and the commissioner and get the lay of the land and review and see what is the best alternative . this is just to see what are the best available options , he added . as well as the red###bulls in new jersey , the other professional team in the new york area is the re formed cosmos who will join the second tier north###american###soccer###league later this year . retired former england midfielder david###beckham , who played for los###angeles###galaxy , is in talks with mls regarding an option he has to create a new mls team but his deal with the league explicitly ruled out new york###city as a possible location for such an expansion###franchise . soriano said beckham was never considered for any role in the new franchise .
arlington , tex . brent###lillibridge already had a lot on his mind by the time he was preparing to go to the on deck circle in the ninth###inning . he had committed an error in the sixth###inning that opened the door for four runs to score , and then he was told that unless eduardo nunez got a hit in front of him , he would come out for a pinch###hitter . in fact , if the yankees had a spare third baseman , lillibridge would most likely have been taken out of the game before that , or might not have been playing at all . even if his self confidence was ebbing and his ego was bruised , lillibridge said he told himself , stop pouting . if nunez got a hit , there would be work to do . nunez did get the hit , ripping a triple to center###field that scored vernon###wells from second base with the tying run off joe###nathan , the rangers closer who blew his fifth save against the yankees , including one big one in the 2009 playoffs . spared the indignation of being pulled back to the dugout , lillibridge went to the plate with nunez on third base and laced a single to left . nunez scored the go ahead run and the yankees beat the texas###rangers , 5 4 , in their 100th game of the season . mariano###rivera sealed the victory with his 32nd save . rivera threw a perfect ninth###inning and the yankees won for only the fourth time this season when trailing after eight innings . lillibridge , who had played in only two games before tuesday and was batting just . 167 , was forced into the starting###lineup when luis cruz was unable to play because of a right knee###injury . with cruz out , manager joe###girardi decided that he would pinch hit for lillibridge only if nunez made an out , and in that case , catcher chris stewart would have entered the game as the third baseman in the bottom of the ninth . stewart , a high###school shortstop , has not played third base in the major###leagues , and played there for one pitch in the minors . but it did not matter as nunez got the triple , giving lillibridge the chance to stay in the game and deliver a memorable hit . i started creeping back over and stopped pouting after a couple of pitches and said , 'hey , i 've got a chance to maybe hit again and i got a big###hit , ' he said . the yankees improved to , which translates into about an 86 win season . the last time yankees won fewer than 90 games was , when their string of playoff###appearances ended after 13 seasons . in the ninth , nathan gave up a one out walk to vernon###wells , who went to second on a wild###pitch by nathan after nathan 's plant foot slipped on the mound . the ball bounced three feet in front of the plate , ricocheted off the back wall and rolled all the way to third base . then nunez drove a ball over the reach of center###fielder craig gentry , who crashed into the wall . wells scored easily to even the score at 4 4 as nunez stumbled his way to third . phil###hughes , who has had an inconsistent season , pitched well without his best stuff and gave up three runs all of them unearned in the sixth . with one out in that inning , nelson###cruz hit a ground###ball to third base that attacked lillibridge , and he was charged with an error . lillibridge was at third only because of luis cruz 's injury , which may necessitate a trip to the disabled###list after the knee swelled significantly tuesday###morning . with nelson###cruz on first , adrian beltre doubled to center to plate texas' first run . it was only the third hit hughes had allowed . one out later beltre scored on a single to right by elvis###andrus . that signaled the end for hughes , who trudged off the mound with a one run lead , hoping that boone###logan could get out of the inning with the lead intact . but logan gave up a two out home###run to mitch###moreland , who drove a juicy 1 0 pitch over the wall in center###field , giving the rangers a###4 3 advantage . hughes sat in the dugout during the rest of the inning with a blank stare on his face . it was a grind , he said . it was n't###easy . derek###jeter took batting practice with the yankees for the first time since he strained his right quadriceps july . he also took ground###balls and ran sprints in the outfield without any problems . jeter is eligible to come off the disabled###list saturday and still believes he can make that date . ... mariano###rivera had lunch with the panama national###soccer###team tuesday in dallas . panama is playing mexico in the gold cup###semifinals at cowboys###stadium on wednesday .
florham###park , n.j . ellis lankster has a large###extended###family , and growing up in prichard , ala . , he spent a lot of time with his cousins older , bigger , stronger cousins who dispensed tough###love in maximum doses . impromptu wrestling matches . flagrant elbows on the basketball court . gang tackling in football games . after he took enough bumps and bruises , his survival mechanism kicked in . when his cousins chased after him , he ran faster . he also learned to hit back . i had to get them before they got me , lankster said . this was , as lankster now realizes , valuable preparation for his career in the n.f.l . in a dangerous sport , he might have the most dangerous role . he is a gunner , or flier , on the jets' kickoff and punt coverage units , the man asked to evade one opponent , sometimes two , while sprinting downfield ahead of everyone else for the privilege of hurling his body into a returner . steve###tasker , the former buffalo###bills receiver considered the pre###eminent gunner of recent###times , likened his mission to fighting your way up a down escalator that 's very crowded and only having five seconds to do it . you 're in that big a hurry , tasker , now a cbs analyst , said in a telephone interview . and you 're going to get your butt kicked pretty good if you do n't want it . those five seconds are mayhem , a street fight on the dead run , and lankster cherishes it . all of his studying during the week watching film , practicing technique , choreographing moves to beat the double###team is just preamble to the physical###confrontation , that act of becoming a human missile without regard for his well being . which he did , and quite well , on the second half kickoff last sunday against the bills . lankster said that ben kotwica , the jets' special teams coach , had told him , no lane , no contain . that gives lankster the freedom to improvise as long as he runs toward the ball . so he dashed up the middle , evaded the two man wedge and , unblocked , flung himself at marcus easley 's knees , upending him at the buffalo . conscious of the n.f.l . 's crackdown on violent hits , lankster goes right for the legs that is always his strategy , but especially so on kickoffs , when he and the returner are running at full speed . on punts , he tends to home in on the returner 's outside leg . whoever catches the ball goes right or left first anyway , so i just take my shot , lankster said . i 'll tell you , it 's been working good . sometimes , however , he must adjust . covering a fourth###quarter punt in the jets' season opening victory against tampa###bay , he split two defenders and arrived just as eric page caught the ball . lankster tried wrapping up page from the side , but , he said , he just did n't want to fall . so the 5 foot , 190 pound lankster picked up the 180 pound page he felt light , real light and suplexed him to the turf . i think he got that move from watching cable###tv or something , kotwica said . lankster 's aggressiveness belies a gentle soul , one of the jets' more likable and quirkier personalities . one of those quirks when choosing among three mississippi junior###colleges , lankster picked jones county . why ? because it 's in ellisville , he said matter of factly . that 's the only reason i went there . he balances the yes sir no sir politeness of his upbringing he insisted upon moving an interview out of the locker###room because it was too noisy with the exuberance of someone who cannot believe that he plays football for a living . before games , he 'll skip around the locker###room yelling and singing , said linebacker nick bellore , another special teams force . i mean , it 's terrible singing , and i do n't know what he 's yelling half the time , but he definitely switches moods . we all do , but he really does . a cornerback by trade , lankster has carved this niche out of necessity . as other defensive###backs have passed him on the depth###chart , cutting into his playing time , lankster has remained valuable because of his special teams prowess . tim###mcdonald , who coaches the jets' secondary , said that lankster recently told him that he would make the pro###bowl for special teams . when you 're not a starter in this league and you 're a defensive back , you better be darn good at special teams , mcdonald said . you 've got to be fearless . you 've got to be tough . you have to be willing to throw your body in front of a guy moving 100 miles an hour . ellis is all of those things . lankster , 26 , also has a fair amount of know how . for all of the aggression his job demands , finesse can be just as important , if not more so . it is one of the more underappreciated skills in the league , the ability to keep a punted football from traveling into the end###zone by batting it back into the field of play . the foundation was established in practice early last week , when lankster grasped that ryan quigley tended to angle his pooch punts toward the left sideline . and so late in the fourth###quarter against the bills , when he was lined up on the right of the formation , lankster pushed aside his defender and zipped toward the far corner . he tracked down the bouncing###ball and threw it back into the field of play before it crossed the goal###line . isaiah trufant downed it at the buffalo 1 with 21 seconds remaining , forcing the bills to go 99 yards for the tying###score . the next day , a week after telling lankster the jets needed a big special teams contribution from him , coach rex###ryan singled him out in a team meeting for his performance . tasker said he used to derive more satisfaction from pinning the opponent at the 1 you get 19 yards of field###position , he said , and that 's enormous than from delivering a powerful tackle . lankster , perhaps not surprisingly , disagreed . i 'm not scared to give a hit or take a hit , lankster said . if you want to try to stop me , you better get ready for a physical battle . i 'm going to make that tackle , and no one 's going to stop me .
new york wealthy###chinese are hiring u.s . women to serve as surrogates for their children , creating a small but growing###business in , 000 designer american babies for china 's elite . surrogacy agencies in china and the united###states are catering to wealthy###chinese who want babies outside the country 's restrictive family###planning policies , who are unable###to###conceive themselves or who are seeking u.s . citizenship for their children . the possibility of emigration is another draw u.s . citizens may apply for green cards for their parents when they turn . while there are no figures for the total###number of chinese who have sought or used u.s . surrogates , agencies in both countries say demand has risen rapidly in the past two years . u.s . fertility clinics and surrogacy agencies are creating chinese###language web###sites and hiring mandarin speakers . circle surrogacy , based in boston , has handled half a dozen chinese surrogacy cases over the past five years , said john weltman , its president . i would be surprised if you called me back in four months and that number had n't doubled , he said . that 's the level of interest we 've seen this year from china and the very serious conversations we 've had with people who i think will be joining us in the next three or four months . the agency , which handles about 140 surrogacy cases a year , 65 percent of them for clients outside the united###states , is opening an office in california to serve clients from asia better . mr . weltman said he hoped to hire a representative in shanghai next year . the increased interest from chinese parents has created some cultural tensions . u.s . agency###staff members who ask that surrogates and the prospective parents develop personal###relationships have been surprised by potential chinese clients who treat surrogacy as a strictly commercial###transaction . in china , where surrogacy is illegal , some clients keep secret the fact that their babies were born to surrogates , going so far as to fake pregnancies , agents say . chinese interest in obtaining u.s . citizenship is not new . the 14th amendment to the u.s . constitution gives anyone born in the united###states the right to citizenship . a growing number of pregnant chinese women travel to america to obtain u.s . citizenship for their children by delivering there , often staying in special homes designed to cater to their needs . while the numbers are unclear , giving###birth in the united###states is now so commonplace that it was the subject of a hit romantic###comedy movie , finding mr right , released in china in march . over all , the number of chinese visitors to the united###states nearly doubled in recent###years , from one million in 2010 to . 8 million in , u.s . immigration statistics show . mr . weltman said that prospective chinese clients almost always want u.s . citizenship for their babies . other agencies pointed to a desire to have children educated in the united###states . some wealthy###chinese say they want escape###routes overseas because they fear they will be the targets of public or government anger if there is more social###unrest in china . there is also a perception that their wealth will be better protected in countries with a stronger rule of law . at least one chinese agent promotes surrogacy as a cheaper alternative to the american eb 5 visa , which requires a minimum investment in a job creating business of , 000 . while the basic surrogacy package chinese agencies offer costs between as much as , 000 , if you add in plane###tickets and other expenses , for only , 000 , you get two children and the entire###family can emigrate to the u.s. , said a shanghai based agent . that cost still means the surrogacy alternative is available only to the wealthiest chinese . prospective parents typically pay the surrogate between , 000 and , 000 , an agency fee of , 000 to , 000 and legal###fees as high as , 000 . if egg donation is required , that can cost an additional , 000 and prenatal###care and delivery fees can run between , 000 and , 000 . indeed , surrogacy in the united###states is so expensive that in recent###years hundreds of american parents have reportedly###turned to surrogates in india .
in the quarter of the united###states open women 's draw so loaded with italians it should have been officially###named little italy , intracountry clashes have flourished . fittingly , there will be an all italian quarterfinal . under very different circumstances and on two sides of a long rain delay , flavia###pennetta and roberta###vinci broke through in their fourth###round matches monday . the unseeded pennetta stopped one of the hottest player on tour this summer , the no . 21 seed simona###halep of romania , and vinci topped a young upstart from her own country , camila giorgi . seeded 10th , vinci is the highest###ranked of the italian women left in the draw , and despite a grandstand court crowd enamored with her younger , more fashionable opponent , she won in overpowering fashion , 6 4 , 6 2 . she finished the match just minutes before the sky opened and soaked the billie###jean###king###national###tennis###center , an all too familiar occurrence . of course i am very happy , vinci said , proclaiming herself lucky to have beaten the turn in weather . i knew it was a tough match . she played good . she plays always strong , flat . i knew i had to change a lot of my focus . next door , at louis###armstrong stadium , pennetta had a different stroke of luck . when the rain started , halep , with three titles in her last six tournaments , was mounting a comeback after losing the first set , 6 2 , and was serving for the second set at 5 4 and . the rain delay lasted about four and a half###hours , long enough to cost halep her momentum and allow the veteran pennetta to rest and rebound . when the match resumed , halep lost not only set point , but also the game and then the set , in a tiebreaker . pennetta seemed to pounce on halep 's nervous start , and raced ahead , 6 1 , in the tiebreaker winning one 18 shot rally with a punishing forehand and closed it out soon after . the long delay forced tournament officials to rearrange the schedule , postponing the scheduled###match between no . 2 victoria###azarenka and no . 13 ana###ivanovic until tuesday###morning . the rain also interrupted daniela hantuchova 's , 5 7 , 6 2 victory over alison###riske , which had kicked off the day at arthur###ashe###stadium . after the delay , riske rallied to win the second set , but could not maintain the momentum against the veteran hantuchova , who reached the quarterfinals of the open for the first time since . i 've never been in a moment like this before , said riske , who had not advanced###past the first round of a major before this one . she is a seasoned player . she played ball today . so , you know , i did all that i could for this moment , and that 's all i could do . riske , a 23 year old wild###card , was one of two american women remaining in the tournament , along with no . 1 serena###williams . the vinci giorgi matchup was stylistically fascinating , and not just because giorgi 's mother designs her tennis outfits . giorgi , 21 , is the youngest and smallest of the italian women in the draw , but with a powerful game that belies her size ( 5 feet 6 inches and 119 pounds ) and her ranking . she had powered her way into this round with a three set upset of no . 6 caroline###wozniacki , pounding the ball so hard it left everyone wondering where that power comes from . it also made her the crowd###favorite during the match . vinci , 30 , said she knew not to be offended , even if she had been the stalwart of her country 's tennis scene . it is normal , she said . camila is young###player . of course the public wants that camila goes to the quarterfinal or semifinal . when i was on the court , i was thinking about my game , not the public , not the crowd . vinci , a solid veteran , also had plenty of scouting on giorgi . that combination of knowledge and experience paid off in helping her weather giorgi 's early run , when she came out pounding the ball with the ferocity she had against wozniacki and raced to a###4 1 lead in the first set . that go for broke strategy eventually came undone she ended up with 35 unforced###errors to 20 winners as vinci recovered to win the final five games of the set . vinci 's steady play , with only 9 unforced###errors to 12 winners , overcame the free swinging style of giorgi . vinci is headed to her second straight open quarterfinal , having played an all italian one , last year , when she lost to her doubles partner sara###errani . this year , errani was bounced in the second round by pennetta , not playing up to her no . 4 seeding in a match in which she admitted crumpling under the pressure of being seeded so highly . but the upswing in italian women 's tennis continued . there were six italian women in the draw , five of them clumped together to form the little italy quarter . four all italian matches have resulted . the all italian quarterfinal pits the grande dames of the group against each other . pennetta said vinci was like a sister because they were roommates for four years as teenagers . i think is going to be just a really tough match for both of us , said pennetta , who reached the open quarterfinals for the fourth time . you know , we know each other really well . i know her since i think 20 years or more because we live almost in the same place . just , 45 kilometer my house from her house . pennetta , 31 , is a former top 10 player whose ranking fell off after a wrist###injury last season . vinci has quietly climbed the rankings throughout her career , not by radically changing tactics or coaches , but by sticking with what she knows and improving . always the same stuff , same practice , she said . probably the age . so when i go on court , i have more experience than before , but nothing special . what is special is a wave of players from the same country , and not the country fans might have expected . after all , there is one american woman left in the draw and no american men . the united###states open might just become the italian open .
detroit###red###wings goaltender jimmy###howard has maintained his composure despite the increased chippiness of detroit 's series against the chicago###blackhawks in the western###conference###semifinals . wave after wave of blackhawks blazed a path toward howard during game 3 on monday , but he stopped 39 shots in the red###wings' 3 1 victory . the unflappable howard is a primary reason detroit holds a 2 1 series lead . i 'm just trying to breathe and make sure i keep doing it back there , howard said wednesday on the eve of game 4 in detroit . this is when it is fun to play . the crowd is going crazy everybody 's flying around stuff is happening everywhere . you just want to be a part of it and do your job . he added i take two good , deep breaths during the national###anthem , really get calm and focused , and then it 's time to go . in game , the top seeded blackhawks took advantage of the red###wings' turnovers and poor defense to earn a###4 1 victory . but howard was sharp in games 2 and , limiting the high powered chicago offense to one goal in each game . howard has a . 923 save###percentage and a 6 4 record during the playoffs . he helped the red###wings prevail in a seven game first round series against the anaheim###ducks , winning three of four overtime games . detroit coach mike###babcock said howard 's play did not take star###billing often enough . howard was 21 13 7 with five shutouts during the lockout###shortened 48 game regular###season . from the time i came here until now , we need good goaltending now more than we ever did , babcock said . and he 's providing it for us he 's strong and competitive in there . you only talk about your goaltending when it 's no good . probably should talk about him more , because it is good . howard , a 29 year old native of ogdensburg , n.y. , became the starter during the 2009 10 season , taking over for chris###osgood . he considers his ascent a gradual one , with jim bedard , the goalie coach , and osgood , a team###consultant , serving as mentors . what i like about jimmy is you know what you 're going to get he 's consistent , red###wings general###manager ken###holland said . it 's not an accident . he 's done his time , moving up from college at maine , to the minors , to learning from ozzie , to taking over the job himself . he 's always had confidence , but there 's something different about it now , holland added . he 's calmer , more assured . the play comes to him , and he knows what he needs to do . bedard has known howard for more than a decade , first as a scout who recommended that the red###wings draft him . howard was chosen 64th over all in . being steady and staying calm have helped howard along . you ca n't go to the experience store and just buy some , bedard said . jimmy 's come through to this point because he 's had to learn from everything . and those who ca n't get through that process get left behind . the red###wings rewarded howard in april , signing him to a six year , 31 . 8 million###contract###extension . handling the stress of playing goalie in detroit is not easy . photos of howard 's stanley###cup winning predecessors , dominik###hasek , osgood and mike###vernon , are displayed in the hallway leading to the red###wings' locker###room from the joe###louis###arena ice . i try to tune it all out , but sometimes you hear things anyways we 're human , howard said . the only things i can control are how i prepare and how i play . i 've got a great team around me , and we 're all working###hard toward winning . that 's all that matters . the captain henrik###zetterberg gave a wry smile when asked about howard 's performance . i do hear some things at times about goalies in our city , zetterberg said . i do n't know if it is a tradition here that you 're not really believing in your goaltending , but i do n't know what he needs to do to get people believing in him . we in here know he 's a really good goalie it 's been shown .
endicott , n.y . willie wood struggled for so long that when he finally notched that breakthrough victory he knew exactly where to celebrate . no need for anything lavish . i went to a wendy 's drive###thru for dinner , wood said , recalling the aftermath of his triumph a year ago at the dick 's sporting###goods open after making the field as an open qualifier . that was exciting . and career changing . the champions###tour win at en joie golf###club ended a victory drought of more than 16 years . it boosted my confidence###level , said wood , who beat michael allen on the first hole of a playoff . it 's fun to feel good about your game . probably the worst###thing is expectations change . not just expectations for me , expectations from other people . i used to get texts from other people when i 'd finish 25th in a tournament saying , 'well done . ' now , if i finish 25th it 's , 'hang in there . it 'll be ok next week .

los###angeles since making the announcement last spring that he is a gay professional basketball###player , jason###collins has been widely###praised , received much support and made many new friends . but with training###camp for a new season under way , he has been waiting for a call from an n.b.a . team . any n.b.a . team . when collins , 34 , a 7 foot center , wrote his coming out cover story for sports###illustrated my declaration , he said he proudly spoke of having been called a pro 's pro for his team first , lunch pail style . never a star , he has nonetheless had a career###spanning 12 years and 6 teams after four years at stanford , where he played with his twin , jarron . that 's how i still consider myself , he said wednesday in his first interview since n.b.a . training###camps opened last month without his participation . sure , i 've picked up another title . but i feel that 's always who i 'm going to be that person who sets a good example , who represents the sport and is an asset to my team and a role###model for other players . the question collins has to ponder is why he has not been signed as a free###agent . is it because he is at best a marginal player with modest career###statistics . 6 points and . 8 rebounds a game ) nearing the end of his career , one who would cost more than a younger player based on the league 's collectively bargained pay###scale ? or is there something more sinister at work related to the new role he would play ? collins did not dismiss the latter notion or address it . you do n't want to speculate i do n't go there , he said while picking at a bowl of greens in a cafe in the brentwood section of los###angeles , near where he lives . but while conceding he would be at the lower end of a team 's depth###chart at this stage of his career , he admitted being perplexed because , he said , i feel there are players in the league right now that , quite frankly , i 'm better than . as teams firmed up their rosters in late###summer , collins 's agent , arn tellem , received inquiries from at least three teams in the market for a reserve big###man who understood positional defense . one of them , the detroit###pistons , settled on josh###harrellson , a third year player who cost the pistons more than , 000 less than the nearly . 4 million collins would have earned the minimum###salary for a player with his experience . several league executives said the number of teams interested in collins had shrunk because of new penalties for teams exceeding the luxury tax threshold . brooklyn was thought to be a potential landing###site because collins spent roughly###half his career with the nets when they played in new jersey , where he was a trusted teammate of jason###kidd , now the team 's coach . but with the nets' soaring payroll , collins would have cost the team almost four times his salary in taxes . collins acknowledged that signing younger players would be more prudent financially , but he asked how experience could be discounted in such a competitive###sport . in my mind it should n't be about that , he said , referring to minimizing costs . the n.b.a . is for the best players , not for the most affordable players . there is n't a professional athlete that does n't want to play , 13 years . what i did when i was younger was look up to the guys like dikembe###mutombo and alonzo###mourning who played over a decade . what did they do to last that long ? a lot of it is keeping your body in shape , keeping your mind sharp , staying hungry . you should always want guys around like that to set that example , in my mind . david###stern , the n.b.a . 's commissioner , and adam###silver , who will replace stern in february , would not comment on collins , other than to say that the league had been in close###contact with tellem and that they were satisfied that teams were making only basketball related###decisions . but one team 's general###manager , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said that some teams just might not want to deal with it because of the media implications . the issue of what might be a challenge for an individual team versus what is best for the league 's overall image figured to be a thorny one for the n.b.a . from the moment collins publicly###declared his intention to be the first openly###gay###man playing a major american team###sport . ( robbie###rogers of major###league###soccer 's los###angeles###galaxy has since filled the breach . )

london from the moment last saturday 's premier###league game between arsenal and aston###villa began , goalkeeper brad###guzan was in constant###motion . left###arm outstretched and gloved index###finger pointed , he continually warned villa 's back line of potential###danger . he shouted encouragement to one of his central###defenders , told his right back where to position himself and applauded when pressure from his left back prompted an arsenal cross to sail harmlessly over the crossbar . and that was just in the game 's first three minutes . for guzan , every moment on the field is golden . he was a backup for most of the past four seasons , a holding###pattern that tested his persistence and cost him his place on the united###states national###team . this season he has finally established himself as aston###villa 's starter , but the journey has been long and hard and , at times , even a little embarrassing . it 's been a bit up and down , guzan said , preceding the sentence with a laugh . there have been definitely some good and great times , but there have been some frustrating times as well . like making a single appearance in a premier###league game in his first three years with villa . or waiting until his fourth###season to get a start in one . even guzan 's highest moments were accompanied by staggering lows , like the time he led aston###villa to the league###cup###final against manchester united in 2010 only to be dropped for the final in favor of a fellow american , brad###friedel . villa 's manager at the time , martin###o'neill , had been instrumental in acquiring guzan from major###league###soccer in , but after buying him , he rarely used him . the league###cup matches had been guzan 's opening , and o'neill had started him in each of villa 's previous###games in the competition that season . he watched guzan save four penalties one in regulation and three more in a shootout against sunderland in the fourth###round . i think he 's a great keeper in the making , o'neill said after the game . still , o'neill opted to go with the more experienced friedel in the final . missing out on the rare chance to make a start at wembley , guzan admitted , left a sour###taste that still has not gone away . but overtaking friedel , who extended what became an eight year streak of consecutive###starts in the premier###league during his three years in the midlands , was never realistic . seeking , and needing , playing time after his inactivity cost him his place as tim###howard 's backup for the united###states , guzan went on loan to hull###city of the second tier###league championship for three months early in . hull is not the most glamorous destination it was once labeled the worst place to live in britain by a television show but it suited guzan fine . he made 16 starts for hull###city , winning praise from the club 's hierarchy and supporters before returning to his old spot on villa 's bench for the final month of the season . when friedel left for tottenham that july , guzan must have thought a promotion was forthcoming . his dream , however , was quickly dashed when alex###mcleish the third of four permanent managers guzan has played under at villa signed the veteran shay given , who by then had been capped more than 100 times by ireland . guzan filled in capably when an injury###sidelined given for a month last season , but when given was healthy , guzan slid back into his backup role . frustrated , guzan and his agent at the time , richard motzkin , decided to end talks about extending his contract , which expired when the 2011 12 season ended . it had been multiple years that brad did n't have the chance to play game in , game out , which obviously takes its toll , motzkin said . for a keeper it 's particularly difficult because a field player might be able to get minutes here and there . as a keeper , typically it 's a 90 minute position , so if you 're not the first choice , you 're sitting quite a bit . at the start of last summer , guzan began###preparing for a move motzkin said teams in england and germany had expressed interest but when mcleish was fired and replaced by paul###lambert , guzan began to consider a return . i felt villa was extremely###loyal to me in terms of giving me a chance to come from the u.s . to england and start my european career , he said . crucial to the securing of a three year contract in july , motzkin said , was a whirlwind trip guzan made to meet lambert after an initial phone###conversation . he took an overnight flight from chicago , got to the airport , drove to villa , met with lambert and drove back that afternoon and flew home , motzkin said . for a manager to see a player take a trip across the pond for about 24 hours , it says a lot about how important it was to the player . the conversation had nothing to do with money . it was about football . the manager did n't###guarantee brad anything , but he told brad it was going to be a fair competition .
dublin , ohio jordan###spieth 's mother had just finished telling a reporter about her son 's unease with being the center of attention at this week 's presidents###cup when spieth 's practice group arrived at the par 3 12th tee at muirfield village golf###club . stepping up to hit after a teammate , tiger###woods , the 20 year old spieth sent his 7 iron shot toward the flagstick 173 yards away . from where she stood in the gallery , christine spieth could not see her son 's swing , only the flight of the ball as it tracked toward the pin . she watched as the ball landed a foot from the hole and trickled into the cup for an ace . spieth 's mother excused herself to phone her father about spieth 's latest attention###grabbing feat . by the time she dialed his number , it was too late . he said he was watching spieth being interviewed on the tee by a golf###channel reporter . never one to parade his successes , spieth suddenly###finds himself on the pga###tour 's lead float after a summer in which he has become in short order the first teenager in 82 years to win a tour event the first player since woods in 1996 to start the season with no status and end it at the elite field tour championship and the first rookie to play for the united###states in the presidents###cup , after being chosen as one of the captain fred###couples 's discretionary picks . the other americans all want to be paired with spieth , who will play in thursday 's four ball matches with 46 year old steve###stricker in a may november pairing against ernie###els and brendon de jonge of the international team . brandt###snedeker described spieth as having that wow factor , and his game , according to the 42 time tour winner phil###mickelson , is far more advanced than his was when he won a pga###tour event as an amateur at . the world 's news###media want to hear from spieth , who wednesday###afternoon was ushered to the microphone stand surrounded by the most cameras , the same stand that had been vacated minutes###earlier by mickelson , who appeared in his first presidents###cup in , when spieth was barely walking . the attention , spieth said , is just what comes with it if you 're playing well , and maybe because of my age it 's added a little bit . he added , i do n't###necessarily enjoy it or strive for it . spieth 's play , and his poise , have won him a bevy of followers , none as ardent as one of his first fans , his sister , ellie . born with an undiagnosed neurological###disorder , she is 12 with the mental###capacity of a 5 year old . she has attended two tournaments this year , and he finished in the top four in both . spieth lights up when he talks about his sister 's singular sense###of###humor and how hanging around her keeps him grounded . when i 'm upset at a tournament or do n't###finish it off the way i should , it really does put things in perspective , he said during the fedex###cup###playoffs . that was a crowd 's roar to his mother 's ears . you hear something like that , she said , and you 're like , 'oh , o.k. , he does get it . spieth , who was born and raised in dallas , is the firstborn of christine , who played division###iii basketball in college , and shawn , who played###college###baseball . the couple 's middle###child , steven , is a freshman basketball###player at brown . spieth experienced###success as a quarterback and as a left handed pitcher before deciding to concentrate on golf when he entered his teenage###years . his friends questioned his decision because they thought football and baseball scored much higher in the coolness factor than golf . i think he kind of hid his talents from his friends , spieth 's mother said . when he 'd come home from tournaments with trophies , he would n't display them and he 'd say , 'no , i 'm not telling anybody what i did . ' this year , spieth has heard from a few of the friends he made playing###football and baseball . they have sent him e mails and texts to let him know how cool it is that he is doing so well playing###golf . the validation , he said , is nice . the main###attraction of the game , spieth said , is that nobody has ever recorded a perfect round , so there is always room for improvement . i like controlling my own destiny , he said . raising a child with an undiagnosed disorder can leave a family feeling helpless , as if no one has any control . there 's no plan of action , spieth 's mother said . it 's a day by day , month by month , year by year progression of how ellie does . in high###school , spieth started helping out in his sister 's classroom once a week . his mother described it as a turning###point for him . he saw that we 're not alone , that so many families are going through this , she said . also , spieth said , i got to see her around her peers . he added , a lot of them are much smarter at certain subjects than we were at their age , and , you know , they just have some things that they do n't do quite as well , but it 's a lot of fun to be able to help . when all three spieth children were living at home , both parents rarely attended their son 's tournaments . usually his father would accompany him while his mother attended his brother 's games and tended to his sister 's needs . now , with their sons expanding their horizons , the spieths have more freedom to stretch their schedules . on wednesday , someone asked spieth 's parents if they were planning to attend the winners only tournament in maui , hawaii , in january . his father said they were .
on wednesday , 30 pianists from 13 countries will gather at a hotel ballroom in downtown fort###worth for a drawing of names , a tradition that will establish the performance###schedule for the van###cliburn###international###piano###competition . two days later , the recitals and concerts will begin at bass performance###hall before a 13 member jury . the competition , held once every four years , mixes a little bit of american###idol with a whole lot of liszt and rachmaninoff . it will end on june 9 with the awarding of the victory medals . this year 's cliburn , its 14th iteration , will be different from previous competitions in one critical respect van###cliburn , the concert pianist for whom it is named , will be absent . mr . cliburn died in february of bone###cancer . his death came as the competition , which was established in 1962 to honor mr . cliburn 's 1958 victory at the international###tchaikovsky###competition in moscow , had reached a crossroads . in recent###years , other piano competitions have eclipsed it , and some suggest that such events in general have outlived their usefulness , especially in an age of reality###television competitions , when audiences , rather than elite judges , often decide which performers rise to the top . the question now is whether the cliburn can survive without van###cliburn . i think it may have coasted too long on the founder 's name and failed to keep up with global developments , said norman###lebrecht , the author of who killed classical###music ? and the maestro myth . the piano competition as a spectacle was turned around by the last international###tchaikovsky###competition in moscow in , where every stage was viewable online and daniil trifonov emerged as a world star , he added . nothing at the cliburn has come close to such excitement in many years . the cliburn began###streaming audio of the competition online in , and in 2009 offered extensive online###video coverage of performances and rehearsals . the 2011 tchaikovsky upped the ante , with innovations like four simultaneous video streams and audience###voting . the famously courtly mr . cliburn was never involved in the operation or judging of the competition , but he was a regular fixture at performances and could often be seen hugging contestants after especially grueling rounds . his presence lent star power to an event that in its heyday in the 1960s and '70s was one of the world 's most prestigious piano competitions . yet for at least the past decade , criticisms have dogged the cliburn . one common###complaint is that few widely embraced performers have emerged from it . the only winner of the competition who has become a legendary###figure is radu###lupu , said scott cantrell , the classical###music critic for the dallas###morning###news , referring to the grammy winning , romanian born pianist , who won the competition in . whether this kind of gladiatorial situation is an ideal way for identifying significant musicians is a real###question . mr . lebrecht has asserted that many piano competitions , including the cliburn , are too insular and may indulge in favoritism . at least two judges on this year 's jury have current or former students competing . cliburn officials counter that if a judge tried to vote for his or her own student , the vote would be nullified . mr . lebrecht suggested that one solution might be to allow online audience###voting to factor into the judges' decision . the days of smoke filled rooms are over , he said . if the competition is to survive , walls need to be broken down . a series of high###profile turnovers have also troubled the van###cliburn foundation , the organization that oversees the competition . following the 2009 edition , its longtime###president and chief###executive , richard rodzinski , left to become general director of the tchaikovsky , which he is widely###credited with revitalizing . mr . rodzinski 's replacement , david worters , left in , after six months . the longtime chair of the foundation 's board , alann sampson , became interim###president , then resigned abruptly last fall . whether the changes at the top signal a larger problem is not known no one involved has been willing to discuss the matter publicly . in a recent interview , jacques marquis , who was named###president of the foundation in march , declined to answer###questions about the possibility of organizational infighting . talking about management is not an option , he said . mr . marquis plans to expand the cliburn 's online presence to include behind the scenes features and additional profiles of competitors . this year , for the first time , audience members can use mobile###devices to vote , with the results posted###online . ( the votes will not be a factor in the jury 's decision . ) a series of tributes to mr . cliburn are planned during the event , but mr . marquis does not want the proceedings to turn into an extended memorial###service . at the awards###ceremony we will give the prizes , and then we go on . because carrying van 's vision forward means moving the vision along .
( reuters ) englishman john###parry built on a recent improvement in form to card an eight under par 64 and take a one shot lead in the opening round of the scottish open in inverness on thursday . his round featuring eight birdies put him ahead of compatriot simon###khan with american phil###mickelson and thailand 's thongchai###jaidee among a group of seven tied for third on six under . parry , a former tour champion at the 2010 vivendi cup in paris who had to secure his return to the european###tour last november at its qualifying###school , had missed the cut in seven of his first 10 events this season before finishing###tied 28th at last month 's u.s . open . i think from when i lost my ( european###tour ) card , i maybe panicked a bit coming into the last few events because you know you 're struggling , the 26 year old parry was quoted as saying on the tour website ( www . europeantour . com . just make sure you do the right things constantly and you 'll get the results . i 've been playing better . i think the u.s . open was the catalyst for me to start playing better , making cuts . it 's renowned for being the toughest event of the year ... if you can compete on that , you know you can compete on any course . last year 's winner , india 's jeev###milkha###singh , is on five under while south african ernie###els , who will defend his british###open crown next week , is at level par .
propellers where faces ought to be . woman on woman death matches . celebrity###chefs with a taste for human###flesh . all you cinephiles who like to find grand statements and social###criticism in horror###movies , prepare to bloviate . it 's midnight at the tribeca###film###festival . the festival has a menu of horror###films in the midnight section ( though that does n't###necessarily mean that they 're showing at midnight , which begins on thursday###night . the same night , the festival is offering a free outdoor treat a showing of the birds , alfred###hitchcock 's 1963 creeper about an avian attack . the birds has had a lot of baggage piled on it . analysts have found in its relatively simple###story a complex oedipal treatise , a message about nature 's displeasure with humans' cavalier treatment of the environment , a statement about the mob###mentality that produced nazism and mccarthyism , and more . other horror###films from that era have undergone the same parsing . every monster that ever terrorized an urban###area or a small###town is an allegory for the threat of nuclear annihilation or some such . overreaching ? in many cases , probably . sometimes a swamp creature is just a swamp creature . nonetheless , horror###films must be micro examined to justify all those film school classes , so let 's take a look at what the midnight section might be telling us . beginning with the daffy fresh###meat , a new zealand comedy directed by danny mulheron . rina ( hanna tevita ) returns from boarding###school to find that her parents and brother have become cannibals . while you 've been away , your father and i have had a wee lifestyle change , her mother ( nicola kawana , a famous television chef , tells her in the understatement of the season . that news barely has time to sink in before a bungling band of criminals stumbles into the family 's home and takes everyone hostage . but think of it as a demented variation of stockholm###syndrome to this family , kidnappers look like just another meal . perhaps mr . mulheron is commenting on modern day concerns about the food###supply . if you want to be sure you know where your meat came from and how it was processed , just eat your houseguests . another offering with a wacky streak is frankenstein 's army , a film from the netherlands , directed by richard raaphorst with a definite re###animator vibe . it 's world###war###ii , and soviet###army troops pushing into germany discover a nazi experiment gone haywire . the germans have been trying to assemble supersoldiers by stitching together body###parts and assorted hardware , but the resulting creatures are running out of control . the effects shop was working###overtime for this one , and the actors involved will no doubt long brag about being credited as wall zombot , 4 eyes worker or hammerhead . a particularly tasty moment comes when a thing with a propeller for a face blows up . feel free to read this wild film as a dissertation on an age when enhancement of the human body is already accepted as standard###practice . my father said men would be more efficient if they had hammers and screwdrivers instead of fingers , the mastermind of the nightmare says . furniture gets into the act in marina de van 's dark touch , another film ( this one a co production of companies in france , ireland and sweden ) in which objects become lethal . these are set off by a girl named neve ( missy keating , who , like her forerunners in carrie and firestarter , has a mysterious###power to summon havoc . dressers and silverware turn deadly when she gets riled , but the director is n't making a flip comment on ikea in this film , which is perhaps too serious for its own good . she points , albeit vaguely , to child###abuse as a source of neve 's disturbing abilities . how much of the story is taking###place in the main###character 's head is unclear , a problem shared by mr . jones , an american film by karl mueller . scott ( jon###foster ) and penny ( sarah###jones ) take up residence in a remote cabin , where scott hopes to make a documentary about going back to nature , but soon the pair stumble on the workshop , as it were , of a mysterious outsider###artist known as mr . jones . the totems mr . jones makes exert a strange power . they get inside your mind and they explode , is how one character describes it . but we are invited to speculate that some or all of what transpires might be in scott 's imagination , because we learn that he has stopped###taking medication for a condition that is never quite defined . so maybe mr . mueller is saying something about society 's increased dependence on pharmaceuticals . though it 's more fun to imagine that he 's commenting on pretentiousness in the art world . or on documentary filmmaking as a career###choice . it 's back to the lab with the machine , a slick british film by caradog james in which a computer programmer ( toby###stephens ) works with soldiers who have suffered brain injuries to try to create human and machine hybrids . but the intent here is more serious than it is in frankenstein 's army . we learn that the programmer is motivated by concern for his daughter , who has a rare neurological###condition , rett###syndrome , that affects cognition and muscle control . he is hoping to discover something that will help her . it 's not hard to imagine the machine as an examination of the odd place we now find ourselves in our relationship to science the very discoveries that can help us are also ominous . do we really want to be able to read our genes closely enough to know that we 'll develop cancer at ? do we want our employers and health insurers to have that knowledge ? those are unsettling questions , but for even more discomfort , there is the brutal raze , an american film from josh waller . women are kidnapped and forced to fight to the death in one on one battles , which are grimly depicted . they do n't know who is making them do this or why . the stuntwoman zoe bell plays a fighter who has bested all comers rachel###nichols is among those she beats to a pulp . all sorts of ideas come to mind . something about how feminism 's achievements have freed women from one prison only to put them in another ? mostly , though , what comes to mind is that this is a hard film to watch . as any good horror###movie should be .

glendale , ariz . the rangers looked awful on opening###night of their 88th season , losing to the phoenix###coyotes by 4 1 on thursday and ruining the debut of coach alain###vigneault . radim###vrbata scored three of phoenix 's goals during the game , in which it seemed just about every ranger overskated the puck or gave it away at least once . we did n't execute , vigneault said in brief postgame remarks . he talked about tactical shortcomings but was not critical of his players . nevertheless , the rangers looked very much like the team that went 1 5 in the preseason . defenseman marc###staal had the rangers' lone goal , which tied the score , 1 1 , early in the second period . staal sustained a serious eye###injury in march that kept him out for almost all of the rest of last season . but he scored as he sped down the left###wing on a power play and buried a setup from rick###nash . however , vrbata responded less than four minutes later with the first of his three straight goals , a natural###hat###trick . all came after rangers miscues . the overall game we were n't quite on , brad###richards said . we 've got to get sharper . vrbata 's first goal gave the coyotes a 2 1 lead at 7 minutes 5 seconds of the second period , less than 20 seconds after the rangers had killed off a penalty . the defensemen who helped kill the entire two minute###penalty , ryan###mcdonagh and dan girardi , were still on the ice and tired . vrbata 's second goal , at 10 of the third , came eight seconds after girardi was sent off for roughing phoenix 's mikkel boedker . his third , less than seven minutes later , came while the teams were skating four on four . four rangers misplayed the puck during the goal scoring sequence derek###stepan , nash , michael###del###zotto and staal . late in the third period , nash got into a fight his first since the 2010 11 preseason and his first regular###season bout since . he dropped the gloves with martin hanzal after hanzal crushed stepan with a body check . hanzal rarely fights as well only four times in six previous n.h.l . seasons . the rangers missed their captain , ryan###callahan , who sat out while recovering from off season shoulder###surgery . the rangers' next game is at los###angeles on monday , and callahan may be ready for that one . mcdonagh was struck in the face by a vrbata shot in the game 's third minute . he left to receive stitches but returned with about three minutes left in the period . henrik###lundqvist stopped 28 of 32 shots for the rangers . coyotes goalie mike###smith turned aside 23 of 24 shots . the night was a special one for the coyotes and their fans the first game under real ownership since a group led by the alberta financier george gosbee bought the team from the n.h.l . the league had bought it out of bankruptcy four years###ago and operated it until july , and during that time the coyotes lived under a threat of relocation . gosbee and his partners were presented at center ice and spoke in several interviews shown on the video board . we 're here to stay , anthony leblanc , a co owner , told the crowd . at a pregame news conference , there were hugs among the new owners and commissioner gary###bettman and bill daly , the deputy###commissioner . daly flew in from new york on thursday###afternoon and planned to fly back immediately after the game . he said he wanted to be at the game after a half###decade of struggle to keep the franchise running . although the arena was officially###sold out , roughly a quarter of the seats were empty . however , there was at least one sign that arizonans have become bona###fide hockey fans . when bettman and daly were introduced to the crowd , they were booed roundly .
south###bend , ind . notre###dame got off to a strong start to the new season and then received more good news after the game . the no . 14 fighting###irish scored on their first two possessions , each of them three play drives , with tommy###rees connecting with davaris daniels on a pair of 32 yard td passes in a 28 6 victory on saturday . the irish announced after the win that coach brian###kelly had signed a new five year contract . kelly said he was n't too worried that the irish ( 1 0 ) could n't quite seem to put the owls ( 0 1 ) away , saying he had confidence in his defense . i was ok with the dink and dunk that they were going exhibit on offense , he said . for notre###dame , the victory was welcome after a turbulent offseason following an embarrassing 42 14 loss to alabama in the national###championship###game . the victory sets up a big###game against michigan next saturday###night . we 're going to have to play better in all phases against michigan next week , but we 're going to enjoy this victory today , kelly said . the victory was the 200th career###win for kelly , improving his overall record to 200 68 2 and 29 11 at notre###dame . the owls , picked to finish###ninth in the 10 team american###athletic###conference , fell to 2 76 against ranked###opponents . we left a lot of points on the field , temple quarterback connor reilly said . although temple was a heavy underdog , it was still a bit of a disappointing start for first year temple coach matt rhule , because of missed chances . they proved that they can play with that team , rhule said . rees , who regained the starting###quarterback job when everett golson was suspended from school for the fall###semester , was 16 of 23 for 346 yards , his fourth###career 300 yard passing day . i saw some really good things , and some things that we 're going to have to get better at , kelly said . one of the questions about rees was whether he could beat opponents deep in the passing###game . but rees threw a pair of long td passes to daniels , who did n't have a touchdown catch last season . daniels beat temple cornerback anthony robey on both tds . the first drive started with amir carlisle breaking a 45 yard run up the left sideline to the temple . while the second was set up by a short pass to tj jones , who broke two tackles , for a 51 yard gain . one of the questions coming in was 'can we push the ball downfield ? ' i think we answered a lot of those questions right away with his ability to push the ball downfield . i think his patience was better and it will continue to get better , kelly said . rees said he was pleased . there are some things out there that we have to fix as an offense , but i was pleased with how the entire offense played , he said . there were some encouraging signs for temple . first time starter reilly was solid , completing 23 of 46 passes for 228 yards , which was more than the owls had in any game last season . he also ran for 65 yards on 12 carries . rhule installed a pro spread###offense after the owls had the fifth fewest yards passing in the nation , averaging 121 yards a game . but temple missed a pair of field goals wide right before finally scoring in the second quarter to cut the lead to , with kenny harper scoring on a 1 yard run . the irish did n't give up a rushing###touchdown in going 12 0 in the regular###season last year until the eighth game against oklahoma . cooper 's pat was blocked by notre###dame defensive###lineman jarron jones . the irish answered 18 seconds later when rees hit troy niklas at midfield and he faked his way past two temple defenders and raced for a 66 yard touchdown . temple opened the second half with another strong drive , advancing to the notre###dame . reilly threw four straight incomplete passes as rhule decided to go for it on fourth and 6 instead of trying another field###goal . the irish responded###quickly again with a 94 yard scoring###drive , highlighted by a 33 yard pass from rees to chris###brown . george atkinson scored on a 2 yard run to make it . for the irish , it was n't the dominant defensive###effort many expected against temple . there 's things that we have to correct , but this is n't last year 's defense , it 's this year 's defense , safety matthias farley said .
reading , pa . alex###rodriguez spent the final###hours of his three day sojourn to berks###county taking cuts in the batting###cage and fielding ground###balls wednesday###morning before the trenton###thunder faced the reading###fightin###phils at firstenergy stadium . the bleachers were empty for rodriguez 's workout , though dozens of fans had congregated along the ballpark 's padlocked perimeter , hoping for a glimpse or an autograph before rodriguez left , most likely for good . his appearance was a spectacle in reading , a rough hewed factory city that rodriguez said he visited several times to see extended###family as a young###boy . while he recalled trips to nearby hershey , he could not remember much about reading , other than that it was a whole lot different from miami , where he grew up . i never thought i would be coming back to reading , rodriguez said . it 's been a long time . his stint for the thunder , the yankees' class aa###affiliate , was the latest step in his minor###league rehabilitation###assignment . the visit was happenstance , a quirk of the schedule , as rodriguez continued to hone his skills after off season hip###surgery . after he spends the next few days playing with the yankees' class###aaa team in scranton wilkes###barre , he hopes to rejoin the yankees on monday when they play the rangers in texas . for the moment at least , the yankees seem in accordance with that timetable . so his trip to reading will almost certainly become an afterthought , an asterisk , but while he was here it made for an unusual pairing . rodriguez , armed with the richest contract in baseball history , found himself plying his trade in one of the poorest cities in the country . reading has a median###household###income of , 416 , far below the statewide median of , 651 , according to census###bureau data . it 's always been a hardworking town , but it 's not what it used to be , said alex casantini , 37 , a chef who cited a rash of factory closings in the 1970s and '80s . high crime moved in , and a lot of drugs . it really ruined the city . it 's a big shame . casantini , who has season###tickets to the fightin###phils , arrived hours before wednesday 's game with his 6 year old son , dante . as fans crowded the railings along the third base###line , it was difficult to get close to rodriguez , who was flanked on his short trips from the field to the clubhouse by a security detail that included a former professional###wrestler . but as rodriguez made his way down a tunnel ( he did not play in wednesday 's game , he stopped to sign a baseball for dante , who was wearing yankee gear . finally got one ! said his father , who had traveled with his son to the ballpark for a third straight day . casantini said his yankee fandom stemmed from his grandfather , who was enamored with joe###dimaggio . but reading is a baseball town signs at the stadium celebrate the city as baseballtown and many residents say the fightin###phils are a source of civic###pride . casantini , who grew up and still lives in west reading , a leafy suburb across the schuylkill from downtown , named several of the players who had appeared here rocky###colavito , roger###maris , mike###schmidt . carl###furillo , the great brooklyn dodgers outfielder , was born near here and was nicknamed the reading rifle . the minor###league team 's relationship with the philadelphia###phillies dates to . back then , reading was a vibrant city , teeming with manufacturing plants and jobs . downtown , known as center###city , was thick with movie###theaters , restaurants and entertainment . reading was known , in the best possible sense , casantini said , as sin###city a sort of antecedent to latter day atlantic###city . now center###city is pockmarked by empty storefronts . chris###ray , 49 , who identified himself as homeless , sat in the shade tuesday###morning near penn street with his friend charles young , 52 . ray motioned at an office###building behind him , which occupied a block where there once was a popular department###store called pomeroy 's . when you see how this town was 20 years###ago and you see how it is now , ray said , trailing off . it used to be known for factories , he added . there 's none left .
detroit third baseman miguel###cabrera is out of the starting###lineup for detroit 's game against the cleveland###indians on saturday###night . cabrera has been bothered by a strained left abdominal###wall for more than a month . the reigning al mvp made an early exit from each of the tigers' last two games . cabrera leads the majors with a . 359 average and 130 rbis , and his 43 home###runs put him four behind baltimore 's chris###davis . he is seeking his second consecutive triple###crown . general###manager dave###dombrowski said doctors and trainer kevin rand have assured them that cabrera could not make the injury worse by playing . manager jim###leyland has delivered the same message since the slugger was originally injured . our primary###concern with miguel###cabrera is his health , dombrowski said . as much as anybody would , we 'd like to see him win the home###run title , rbi title or triple###crown , but he 's playing for the good of the team . cabrera left thursday 's win against oakland in the fifth inning after hurting his abdomen while making an awkward slide . he was back in the lineup for friday 's game against cleveland , but departed after two innings due to irritation of the abdominal###area . dombrowski said cabrera probably could play on saturday but the decision was to give him the day off . detroit began the day with 7 game lead over second place cleveland in the al###central . ramon santiago got the start at third base against the indians and was in the ninth slot in the lineup . torii###hunter moved back one spot to cabrera 's usual lineup slot of third .
yellen 's opening###remarks janet l . yellen , at her confirmation###hearing before congress to become the federal###reserve 's first chairwoman , defended the fed 's steps to spur economic###growth . washington the questions that janet l . yellen faced on thursday from senators considering her nomination to lead the federal###reserve made two things fairly###clear the job is hers , and it 's not going to be easy . democrats and republicans on the senate###banking###committee treated ms . yellen as if she were already the fed 's chairwoman , skipping over questions about her qualifications and instead venting broad frustrations about the slow###pace of economic###growth . ms . yellen , the fed 's vice###chairwoman since , faced particularly sharp questions about the limited success of the fed 's efforts to stimulate the economy . members of both parties questioned whether the fed 's policies had mostly benefited the wealthy , while doing little to improve life for most americans . the fed 's campaign to hold down interest rates was described as an elitist policy by senator bob###corker , a tennessee republican , and as a sort of trickle###down###economics by senator sherrod###brown , an ohio democrat . it 's not clear to the many americans who have not seen a raise in a number of years , that this policy increases wages and incomes for workers on main###street , mr . brown said . during your time as chair , tell us how you will ensure that the fed 's monetary###policy directly benefits families on main###street . ms . yellen , 67 , avoided any surprises in her calm and careful responses , which hewed closely to the fed 's official###positions and her own past remarks . she made clear that she was committed to continuing the fed 's stimulus campaign , which she said had made a meaningful contribution to economic###growth . she acknowledged that investors benefited from low###interest###rates , in part because they helped lift the stock###market , but she said that people buying homes and cars also were direct beneficiaries . and she emphasized the indirect benefits of the fed 's campaign the ripple effects go through the economy and bring###benefits to , i would say , all americans . the performance appeared to serve its purpose . the office of senator tim###johnson , the south###dakota democrat who is chairman of the committee , said a vote could come as early as next week to send her nomination to the full senate . we need her expertise at the helm of the fed as the nation continues to recover from the great###recession , mr . johnson said at the hearing . ms . yellen will need at least five republican votes to reach the 60 vote threshold that the minority party routinely imposes on presidential###nominees . the votes may not be hard to find . mr . corker appeared to be trying to help ms . yellen when he asked her to state for the record how many times she had voted as a fed official to raise interest rates , thus demonstrating a commitment to control inflation . when she said that she could not remember precisely , mr . corker supplied an answer 27 times , dating back to , when she first joined the fed 's board###of###governors . but david###vitter , republican of louisiana , said after the hearing that he planned to vote against her , citing in particular ms . yellen 's views on financial###regulation . i was leaning no and i am going to vote no , mr . vitter told fox###business###network . unfortunately none of her answers were reassuring to me , including about my biggest###concern about the continuation of too big to fail . mr . vitter had plenty of company in raising###concerns about the fed 's commitment to regulating big banks , an indication of the importance attached in the wake of the financial###crisis to a set of responsibilities that the fed and congress long treated as an afterthought . some of the strongest questions came from senator elizabeth###warren , democrat of massachusetts , who criticized the fed for its regulatory failings before the crisis and expressed###concern that it still was not trying hard enough . the truth is if the regulators had done their jobs and reined in the banks we would n't need to be talking about stimulus , ms . warren said .
titusville , fla . a screaming comes across the sky . again and again , all day long . here at the 36th annual tico warbird airshow , fighter jets and vintage planes roar and rumble by as viewers ooh , aah , and then walk over to the line of food stands to buy funnel cakes and gyros , corn dogs and root###beer floats . the undisputed star , of course , is the air###force###thunderbirds , whose six plane precision flying team crisscrosses a perfect sky in ever changing formations and gives an undiluted thrill to the crowd at least those who brought earplugs . but this is likely to be the last appearance by the thunderbirds until the end of the federal###government 's fiscal year on sept . 30 , if not longer . a performance this weekend by the navy and marine###corps' blue###angels near key###west , fla . , will also be their last for some time . the army 's parachute demonstration###team , the golden###knights , is also suspending performances . the failure of congress to avoid the automatic spending###cuts under what is known as sequestration is being felt in many ways , including the cancellation of white###house tours and the loss of some , 000 slots in head###start early###education programs . along with less visible cuts , the defense###department has suspended operation of the demonstration teams starting april . under sequestration , the air###force must reduce flying###hours by 18 percent , or about , 000 hours , said wendy s . varhegyi , a spokeswoman the decision to ground air show participation allows the air###force to redistribute their flying###hours to support overseas###contingency operations and predeployment readiness###training . it will also save some of the . 75 million annual thunderbirds budget . the cuts make sense , said maren leed , a defense###policy expert at the center for strategic###and###international###studies in washington . i personally think it would be irresponsible if the department of defense did not take cuts like this . that does not mean the decision is popular , even within dr . leed 's own family , she said her 4 year old son is wild about the blue###angels . he got a brochure we read it every night , she said . they had planned to see a performance in may in annapolis , md . i have n't figured out how to tell him yet , dr . leed said . the air shows will feel the effects as well . the blue###angels and the thunderbirds are the biggest###draw that makes the biggest noise , said john cudahy , the president of the international council of air shows , the industry trade group . the absence of the jet teams leaves a big###hole in the air show business . robert###duncan , the chairman of the executive###committee for the indianapolis air show , said that typically , a blue###angels show will add 25 percent to your gate . this summer 's 17th annual show was canceled in february as the uncertainty over sequestration and its effects grew . it was getting difficult to attract sponsors and get commitment for financial###support , mr . duncan said . every time they would ask , 'are the blue###angels coming ? ' we had to say , no pun intended , 'it 's up in the air . ' the ripple effects of just one canceled show can be enormous , mr . duncan said . the air show has raised . 3 million for the riley hospital for children over the years . many of the workers are volunteers , but the show employs contractors for services like publicity , insurance and entertainment . money for aviation###fuel , hotel###rooms and many other things will not be flowing through the local###economy . we canceled our order for 120 golf###carts , he said . other shows will go on . we 'll have a fantastic air show this year , with or without the military teams , said jim dimatteo , an official with eaa###airventure###oshkosh , a gargantuan weeklong celebration in wisconsin of aviation of which the air show is only a part . the wings over houston airshow , which focuses on older military aircraft and will include a re enactment of the attack###on###pearl###harbor , will also proceed in october , said bill roach , the executive###director . we 're going to have a great show no matter what , he said , acknowledging that he expected a 20 percent###drop in attendance without the blue###angels there . lt . col . greg moseley , the commander of the thunderbirds , said that sequestration was unfortunate but that the team would do its best to fulfill the mission of spreading good will and inspiring potential###recruits . mission execution is n't just about flying airplanes , he said . we 're going to send out a blue uniform with a thunderbird patch wherever we can . at this weekend 's air show in titusville , a banner near a display of camper trailers reads save the thunderbirds ! and larry groves , the president of grandsport rv , is gathering###signatures from those attending the show . these guys fly and risk their life every day they fly , he said . and we 're not treating them right . few here seem to agree about what is going on or who is to blame , but no one is happy with lawmakers . jerry trachtman , the air show announcer , tells the crowd that this is likely to be the last thunderbirds show of the spring and summer season , adding we can thank our friends in washington . i 'm sure there is something we can thank them for i just ca n't think of it . at a concession booth , joe foley is selling thunderbirds and blue###angels t shirts and hats , along with other aviation and military knickknacks and jewelry . he travels to 30 shows a year before 'see frustration , ' as we call it , he joked grimly . because they ca n't###agree , they want to make everybody hurt , mr . foley said . it 's all a dog and pony show . briawna bailey does not know anything about sequestration . her parents , jeff and rebecca , have taken briawna and her twin###brother , logan , out of school for a day to see their first air show at age . briawna said she loved seeing the thunderbirds and the aerobatic planes , and she looked into the distance when she said i 'm thinking about , when i grow up ? i might be an airplane driver . pilot , briawna said . and i 'll do all the tricks .
thousand###oaks , california as tiger###woods eyes the twilight of a remarkable###career , he has his sights on records posted by jack###nicklaus and sam###snead and a growing pleasure that his children are starting to understand what he does on the course . world number one woods , comfortably the greatest###player of his generation , has long targeted the 18 major titles claimed by fellow american nicklaus and the 82 career###victories piled up on the pga###tour by the sweet swinging snead . woods , who celebrates his 38th birthday at the end of this month , trails nicklaus 's record mark by four and snead 's milestone by three . yet just as significant for woods as he contemplates his 'bucket list' of future golfing achievements is the burgeoning knowledge of his two children , daughter sam and son###charlie , for what he does for a living . it 's exciting for me to have my two kids now starting to understand what daddy does , woods told###reuters on wednesday as he prepared for thursday 's opening round of the northwestern###mutual world###challenge , which he hosts . it was cool for me this year for the first time to have charlie there to watch me win . he understood it for the first time , that daddy is always in the gym lifting###weights to be able to get the ball out of the rough and out the trees . or that 's how he explains it , woods added with a flash of his trademark smile . charlie was on site at firestone###country###club in august when his father eased to a seven shot victory at the wgc###bridgestone###invitational , earning his 79th win on the pga###tour . he gets it now , woods said of his son . he is excited about the game and he has even told me he wants to caddie for me one day . but that was never a reality until that event ( at firestone . so that gives me a little extra incentive to continue###playing and continue###working because they get so much enjoyment out of watching me on tv and playing . while snead 's target is well within reach , the four majors woods needs to draw level with nicklaus represent a tally achieved by very few golfers in an entire###career . certainly the easier goal is going to be to get to sam 's record , woods said , speaking on the balcony of the imposing clubhouse at sherwood country###club which hosts the world###challenge this week for a 14th and final time . you can get there basically from playing your first three events of the year and winning three in a row . but major championships , they 're spread out a little bit . it 's certainly much harder to get to jack 's number than sam 's . but both of them i regard as significant milestones and hopefully one day in my career i will surpass both of them . certainly i 'd like to continue winning for a long period of time . that 's important to me . winning was a familiar habit for woods during 2013 as he racked up a season high five titles on the pga###tour on the way to being voted player of the year , though he was unable to add to his career tally of 14 majors . i think it was a fantastic year , unfortunately i did n't###win a major championship , said the 37 year old who has come up empty in golf 's blue###riband events since his remarkable playoff###victory at the 2008 u.s . open . i was close at the masters ( tied for fourth ) and the british ( open where he shared sixth###place . a couple of little swings here and there and it might have been a different story . but i won the players ( championship ) at a venue where i have struggled over the years , so to be able to put that together there was quite a good feeling . to win five times , and get player of the year again , that feels pretty good . this week , woods is especially excited to be back at the world###challenge , an event he has won five times and which raises money for tiger###woods foundation projects and the six learning###centers he has set up in the united###states . more than , 000 scholars have gone through the various learning###centers since the first of them was opened in anaheim , california in . it 's so important , what we have been to do and how we have been able to transform kids' lives and allow them the opportunity to go to college and provide them with mentors and internships , woods said . and it 's all because of this event , starting 15 years###ago at grayhawk ( golf###club in scottsdale , arizona ) and now here . sherwood has been an incredible venue over the years and without this event we quite frankly would n't have a learning###center here in orange###county , we would n't have had the ability to create other learning###centers around the country . the tournament moves to florida next year .
washington as the senate edged toward a divisive filibuster vote on chuck###hagel 's nomination to be defense secretary , senator ted###cruz , republican of texas , sat silent and satisfied in the corner of the chamber his voice lost to laryngitis as he absorbed what he had wrought in his mere seven weeks of senate service . mr . hagel , a former senator from mr . cruz 's own party , was about to be the victim of the first filibuster of a nominee to lead the pentagon . the blockade was due in no small part to the very junior senator 's relentless###pursuit of speeches , financial###records or any other documents with mr . hagel 's name on them going back at least five years . some republicans praised the work of the brash newcomer , but others joined democrats in saying that mr . cruz had gone too far . without naming names , senator barbara###boxer , democrat of california , offered a biting label for the texan 's accusatory crusade mccarthyism . it was really reminiscent of a different time and place , when you said , 'i have here in my pocket a speech you made on such and such a date , ' and , of course , nothing was in the pocket , she said , a reference to senator joseph r . mccarthy 's pursuit of communists in the 1950s . it was reminiscent of some bad###times . in just two months , mr . cruz , 42 , has made his presence###felt in an institution where new arrivals are usually not heard from for months , if not years . besides suggesting that mr . hagel might have received###compensation from foreign###enemies , he has tangled with the mayor of chicago , challenged the senate 's third ranking###democrat on national###television , voted against virtually everything before him including the confirmation of john###kerry as secretary of state and raised the hackles of colleagues from both parties . he could not be more pleased . washington 's new bad###boy feels good . i made promises to the people of texas that i would come to washington to shake up the status###quo , he said in e mailed answers###to###questions , in lieu of speaking . that is what i intend to do , and it is what i have done in every way possible in the responsibilities that have been granted to me . in a body known for comity , mr . cruz is taking confrontational tea###party sensibilities to new heights or lows , depending on one 's perspective . wowed conservatives hail him as a hero , but even some republican colleagues are growing publicly frustrated with a man who has taken the zeal of the prosecutor and applied it to the decorous quarters of the senate . senator lindsey###graham , republican of south###carolina , said that some of the demands mr . cruz made of mr . hagel were out of bounds , quite frankly . senator john###mccain , republican of arizona , issued a public rebuke after mr . cruz suggested , with no evidence , that mr . hagel had accepted honorariums from north###korea . all i can say is that the appropriate way to treat senator hagel is to be as tough as you want to be , but do n't be disrespectful or malign his character , mr . mccain said in an interview . he basically came out and made the accusation about money from north###korea or money from our enemies , and he just laid out there all of this accusatory verbiage without a shred of evidence , said senator claire###mccaskill , democrat of missouri . in this country we had a terrible experience with innuendo and inference when joe###mccarthy hung out in the united###states###senate , and i just think we have to be more careful . mr . cruz , a canadian###born lawyer who won an upset primary victory last year , is adamant in his own defense . he said his focus at hearings had been on policy , not personality . with mr . hagel , whose nomination is set for a senate vote the week of feb . 25 , he said his request for financial###disclosures were backed by 24 other senators . as for his statement that mr . hagel may have received honorariums from nefarious sources , the suggestions i have made in my arguments have been merely to raise examples for why i believe senator hagel 's financial###disclosure is so important , he said . comity does not mean avoiding the truth , he added . and it would be wrong to avoid speaking the truth about someone 's record and past policy###positions , even if doing so inevitably subjects me to personal criticism from democrats and the media . to the growing core of ardent conservatives in the senate , mr . cruz has offered a jolt of positive energy .
lake###forest , ill . tiger###woods and chicago used to be a great recipe for winning , or at least coming###close . he won two pga championships at medinah . he won the western###open three times and the bmw championship twice , all at cog hill . woods has finished out of the top 20 only one time in 15 tournaments in the chicago###area , including the 2003 u.s . open at olympia###fields . but he has played the windy###city just twice since his last win ( by eight shots ) in , and neither time was particularly memorable a tie for 15th in 2010 that kept him from qualifying for the tour championship for the first time in his career , and an 0 3 1 record at medinah last year in the ryder###cup . his next shot is at conway farms , a course woods had never seen until the pro am wednesday at the bmw championship . i normally do n't work this hard in a pro am , but i had to do a little bit of work because i was n't out here yesterday , woods said . conway farms , a tom###fazio design north of chicago , becomes the third course in as many years to host the second oldest golf###tournament in america . at a time when 70 players are trying to qualify for the 30 man field at the tour championship , some introductions are in order . luke donald is a member and knows the course better than anyone in the field . zach###johnson is among the few who played conway farms when it hosted the ncaa championship in . steve###stricker drove down from wisconsin on sunday to see the course for the first time . a western golf association official said about half the field was practicing monday , a large###number compared with other events , especially this late in the season . he sent out his caddie , joe lacava , to scout the course ahead of him . it helps that joey has been out here a couple days getting the lines , and we were discussing a lot of it today , woods said . woods said it was different from cog hill and medinah but a nice track . he mostly remembered how confined the layout is on the front nine , restricting gallery movement on a couple of holes . and the closing stretch of holes a reachable par 4 with water down the entire left side , a strong par 4 at no . 16 , a downhill par 3 framed by mounds , and a par 5 closing hole at 570 yards with water in front of the green . adding a wrinkle to a new course is that blistering hot conditions earlier in the week were supposed to yield to cooler temperatures the low 50s in the morning the rest of the week and a wind out of a different direction . that 's where i have to rely on joey a little bit , and we were discussing the weather###forecast and how it 's going to change a little bit , and discussing the different lines and different options , woods said . as i said , we did a little bit of work today , more so than we normally do . woods has won five times this year , bringing his pga###tour career###total to 79 as he closes in on sam###snead 's record of . woods does n't stray much from his schedule , and because he wins so often , he tends to win at the same courses . the last time he won on a golf course he had never played was at the grove outside london for the 2006 american###express championship . the bmw championship is the third fedex###cup playoff event , and the hardest to get some separation . the field has been reduced to 70 players , so for the first time during golf 's version of the postseason , there is no cut . the goal is to get into the top 30 for the fedex###cup finale at the tour championship , where everyone will have a shot at the 10 million prize , and they are guaranteed a spot in at least three of the major championships next year . better yet is getting into the top five in the fedex###cup###standings those players only have to win at east lake to capture the fedex###cup . henrik###stenson , coming off a win at the deutsche###bank###championship , is no . 1 by a small margin . masters champion adam scott is right behind . the onus is on rory###mcilroy , who is no . 41 and figures a seventh###place###finish is needed to get into the tour championship , a consolation###prize for a season gone wrong . donald , meanwhile , is no . 54 and faces a tougher task to avoid missing the tour championship for the first time in five years . i guess if there was ever a year to struggle , to coming into an event needing a big###week , this is a good one to come to , donald said .
philadelphia claude###giroux scored the tying and winning goals in the final###minutes of the third period , rallying the philadelphia###flyers past the columbus###blue###jackets 5 4 on thursday###night . giroux scored two of the flyers' five third period goals as philadelphia stormed back from a 3 0 hole . giroux 's 100th nhl goal was perhaps his most amazing , a backhanded and blind shot that beat curtis###mcelhinney up high with 39 left . the flyers captain had tied it with 39 left . jakub voracek , braydon###coburn , erik gustafsson also scored###goals for the flyers . steve###mason got the win in his first game against his former team . the blue###jackets traded mason to the flyers , and his strong season has helped keep philadelphia afloat through its offensive struggles . cam atkinson , jack###skille , nick###foligno and blake###comeau had goals for columbus . giroux had no view of the net when he beat mcelhinney for the stunning goal . giroux is starting to come around after a lengthy goal drought to open the season . the flyers snapped their scoreless skid and started their rally with a pair of quick goals to open the third . voracek , a former blue###jackets forward , scored his sixth###goal in six games with a wrister from the circle to make it . coburn swiped the puck at the blue line , knocked a low liner toward the net , and the puck one hopped its way past mcelhinney to make it . the blue###jackets , in control for 40 minutes , called timeout to regroup and stall philadelphia 's momentum . it worked for a few minutes . columbus center artem###anisimov hustled for a loose puck off a turnover behind the net and kicked it out to comeau , who was alone for the nice feed and scored his third goal to make it . gustafsson scored his second of the season with 39 left , and giroux came streaking down the right side and finished off a rush with 45 left for the tying###goal , sending the crowd into a frenzy . he was just getting started . the flyers were heavily booed off the ice at the end of the second period , and the familiar chants of e a g l e s ! echoed throughout the wells###fargo###center . the fans were unhappy with a sloppy end to the second in which columbus took a 3 0 lead . with only . 5 seconds###left , jack###johnson cleared the puck from behind the net , and foligno was there to knock in his 10th goal . the flyers recorded only nine shots in the period . columbus has been hit###hard by injuries , but mcelhinney made the early lead stand . atkinson opened the scoring midway through the first with a short handed goal . voracek was stripped of the puck at columbus' blue line , setting up a 2 on 1 for atkinson to bust loose with his 10th goal . the blue###jackets caught the flyers off guard against the boards on a shift###change , setting up yet another 2 on 1 break . this time , skille connected from the circle . mason had 12 wins and a shutout for the flyers in his first full season with the franchise . mason had it all figured out when he went 33 20 7 with 10 shutouts and won the calder###trophy as rookie of the year in , the only season the blue###jackets made the playoffs . he posted a goals###against###average over . 00 each of the next three seasons and was out the door upon the emergence of vezina###trophy winner sergei###bobrovsky . notes voracek has a point in six straight###games . ... the flyers are 15 8 4 since a 1 7 start .
chicago the locker###room floor was strewn with towels , torn bandages and ice . eyes were red and gaits were stilted . after two games and two losses , after 63 minutes in a triple###overtime thriller on saturday , this is how the nets left chicago . there was little to say , and words could scarcely describe the emotional swings in a game 4 matinee that pushed into the early dusk , drama building with each successive overtime , a sold out crowd at united###center left hoarse and delirious . the grim reality for the nets was enough . after the 142 134 loss to the chicago###bulls , the nets are down by 3 1 in this first round series , with game 5 at barclays###center on monday . but there is a price to pay for blowing a 14 point lead with less than four minutes remaining in regulation . there is a sting that will not be relieved easily . the nets were inches from salting away an easy###victory , ahead by 14 points with 3 minutes 19 seconds remaining , when c . j . watson stole the ball from nate###robinson , dribbled alone down court and missed an open , two handed dunk . at the time , it was an embarrassing moment in what had been an altogether pleasant game for the nets , who woke up from their offensive slump in the previous two losses to shoot . 1 percent from the field in regulation . watson smiled and shook his head . some fans at united###center began trickling toward the exit . i was just a little tired , watson said . i should n't have missed it . the bulls seized on the missed###opportunity , particularly robinson , the 5 foot 9 point###guard . robinson reeled off 12 straight###points to bring the bulls back within . with 55 seconds###left , robinson passed to carlos###boozer , who tied the score . the game went into overtime after deron###williams missed a fallaway jumper at the buzzer . they just took it to us , williams said . nate got hot and he did n't###miss a shot . we could n't find an answer for him . in overtime , robinson again led the bulls . with time ticking down , robinson waved a screening joakim###noah away at the top of the key and drove###past williams to deliver a running bank shot with . 7 seconds###left . he hopped into boozer 's arms . that celebration proved premature . the nets called timeout and managed to get joe###johnson open for a game tying runner in the lane , and he delivered , silencing the crowd and giving the nets another chance . it was like a reset , a new start , johnson said . but we just did n't make the big###plays defensively . the nets were never able to build momentum in the second or third overtimes . johnson missed a potential game winning pull up jumper with . 5 seconds###left in the second overtime , and the bulls wore down the nets in the third , outscoring them by 15 7 as the nets missed 6 of 8 shots . i thought our team showed a lot of toughness , bulls coach tom###thibodeau said . nate made big###plays and shots . we had a very hard time getting stops and were fortunate to get a win . after the game , the nets struggled to comprehend how they let such a crucial game slip through their grasp , offering a few basic answers . they did not trap robinson . they shot 29 of 45 from the free###throw line . the bulls ended regulation on a 16 2 run . when it is all said and done , we did not do enough things to win , nets coach p . j . carlesimo said . unlike the 79 76 loss in game , in which the nets took some solace from the way they battled back in the fourth###quarter , there was little saving###grace from saturday 's performance . their offensive showing in the third quarter when they shot 12 of 17 to turn a 58 55 deficit into an 84 76 lead heading into the fourth was largely###forgotten . before the game , there were signs that the emotional strain of consecutive###losses was starting to fray the locker###room . on friday , forward gerald###wallace told###reporters in the team hotel that he had apparently lost his way in the offense , saying , i 've got no clue what my role is . the sound###bite was an added distraction for carlesimo , who described his team as agitated before game . it might have worked positively , though , as wallace responded with 17 points , 9 rebounds and 4 assists before fouling out in the first overtime . evans also played a key role offensively , scoring 15 points with 13 rebounds . for the first time in a week , the offense was not the issue . it was the defense . it was a shootout , carlesimo said . neither of us did a good job at stopping each other . the bulls finished###shooting . 2 percent from the field , with 17 second chance points and 28 points off 19 nets turnovers . boozer continued his solid interior presence , finishing with 21 points , and noah added 15 points and 13 rebounds . the catalyst , though , was robinson . earlier in the game , midway through the second quarter , robinson scuffled with watson , hurling him into the scorer 's table after watson appeared to extend an elbow . the incident incited both benches , but nothing more came of it . for a while , watson appeared to have the upper hand in the confrontation . the nets were winning , things looked good for them , but then he missed that dunk . the rest was history a series potentially pivoting on a dunk that missed , a game that unraveled . it 's a heartbreaker , johnson said . it was a game we let get away .
a louisiana sheriff has apologized for the arrests of as many as a dozen or more men in recent###years on charges that they violated an anti sodomy statute that has been ruled###unconstitutional by the united###states###supreme###court . on saturday , the advocate newspaper in baton###rouge reported that a community###policing unit of the east baton###rouge sheriff 's office had been arresting men who discussed or agreed to meet privately to have consensual###sex with undercover officers . some of the arrests went as far back as 2011 and some were as recent as this month . the men were arrested on charges of violating a louisiana statute barring unnatural carnal copulation , though the supreme###court in 2003 declared such laws###unconstitutional invasions of privacy . the attorney###general of louisiana at the time issued a statement saying the state 's anti sodomy###law would be unenforceable . in each of the known cases in baton###rouge , the district###attorney 's office declined to prosecute , citing a lack of evidence that a crime , like prostitution , had taken place . gay###rights advocates and at least one public###official have publicly questioned why sheriff 's deputies continued to make such arrests when the district###attorney 's office had made it clear that such actions were not criminal . we need to find out when the sheriff was first informed that the d.a . 's office would not prosecute people under this anti sodomy###law because it 's unconstitutional , said john delgado , a baton###rouge city###councilman . hillar c . moore iii , the district###attorney for east###baton###rouge###parish , said he was not aware of the arrests until informed last week by a reporter . but in looking back over the past two and a half years , he found that prosecutors in his office had been referred to such cases 9 or 10 times and the cases were dropped when no evidence was found that money was involved . mr . moore said such arrests were scattered and may have gone unnoticed among the , 000 cases the office handles each year . had it come to our attention and there seemed to be a pattern here i can see how it would have gone up the chain , he said . on monday , sheriff sid j . gautreaux iii issued a statement apologizing to anyone that was unintentionally harmed or offended by the actions of our investigations . the sheriff said that he had instructed his employees to no longer use this unconstitutional law , and that he was conducting a comprehensive evaluation of undercover###operations made by our deputies and will make changes to ensure better supervision , training and guidance . bruce parker , who manages a statewide coalition of gay and lesbian advocacy###groups called equality louisiana , said that there had been at least 12 arrests in recent###years under the anti sodomy statute but he suspected there may have been more . it was really a case of targeting people , mr . parker said . mr . parker said the sheriff 's office has been responsive since the weekend , saying it would work with the capital###city alliance , a baton###rouge based group that is part of the coalition . while mr . delgado said those arrested had a strong case for a civil###suit , mr . parker said some of them were not openly###gay when they were arrested and were unlikely to want further publicity . many of their lives were dramatically ruined because of this , he said .
london for a day , they were the pair who ran roger###federer and maria###sharapova out of town . and then , suddenly , he was plain ol' 116th ranked sergiy###stakhovsky again and she was 131 st ranked michelle###larcher###de###brito . less than 48 hours after affixing their stamp on one of the most stunning days ever at wimbledon , stakhovsky was sent out to court 3 for a third round###match against jurgen melzer and larcher de brito went to court 17 to play karin###knapp . stakhovsky , the man from ukraine who served and volleyed like john###mcenroe in dispatching federer , opened his encore with a pair of double faults in his first service game a sign of worse###things to come en###route to a , 2 6 , 7 5 , 6 3 loss to 37th ranked melzer . de brito , the woman from portugal who yelled every bit as loud as sharapova and matched her groundstroke for groundstroke , went down meekly , 7 5 , 6 2 to 104th ranked karin###knapp on friday . as the results showed , it 's not so easy playing the match after the match . i think i was coming in quite slow , because of the emotions coming off the match with roger , stakhovsky said . you expect yourself to play a little different , maybe . he 's certainly not alone . last year , it was lukas rosol who stunned the tennis world , coming in with his no . 100 ranking in and knocking rafael###nadal out of the second round in five sets . two days later , rosol lost to philipp###kohlschreiber , and this year , he returned and lost in the first round . meanwhile , the man who sent nadal packing this year steve###darcis heck , he did n't even play his next match , sidelined by a shoulder###injury he said he made worse when he barrel rolled into a shot against nadal in the first set . maybe darcis , ranked 135th , had it right . hard to top moments like he had . at one stage , i had to turn my phone off , larcher de brito said . i had almost an hour and a half of press after the match . i practiced and tried to take it easy the next day . but i guess i did n't realize how big the win was . another enduring a similar fate friday was canada 's eugenie###bouchard , the reigning junior###champion who , two days###earlier , had a match on an outside court moved to centre court , then went out and dispatched 12th seeded and former no . 1 ana###ivanovic in straight###sets . two days later , on court 18 in front of about , 000 fewer spectators , bouchard went down , 6 2 to 19th seeded carla suarez navarro . i think that was in the back of my mind , yeah , bouchard said . it 's a totally different situation . not on centre court , not against a big , big player . but i knew that ahead of time . i tried to prepare like it was just another match , which it was . but , yeah , i just think i did n't###play as well as i know i can . larcher de brito felt the same way . after battling back from down a break to 5 5 in the first set , she was ahead 30 0 but let her service game slip . knapp served out the set , broke to open the second , then the rain set in . a few hours later , with the sound of friday###night jazz spilling over from the wimbledon mezzanine , knapp had no trouble putting away the match . over on court , stakhovsky lunged awkwardly for a volley in the first set and , moments later , was calling for the trainer to tape his right ankle . he insisted that had little to do with his loss . more , he said , it was the lack of mental composure a result of the hectic 24 hours after the federer win , during which he took every phone call , granted every interview , signed every autograph . i was not ready for such a turnover , stakhovsky said . what resulted was a game plan that was n't as well thought out or executed as he would have liked . against federer , stakhovsky played serve and volley with reckless abandon , knowing the seven time wimbledon champion was having trouble with his serve . but melzer ? he did n't have nearly that sort of trouble . that fact was evident from the beginning when melzer hit a clean , crosscourt return for a winner in the first game to the end , when he closed the match with an almost identical shot off a wide stakhovsky serve . today i was a bully . i was just going to the net and trying to save it , stakhovsky said . it just did n't work . i mean , yes , i lost at the net . but that 's not the point . i wanted to win . and if i wanted to win , i had to change . but i did n't do it because i did n't think about it . the statistics told part of the story . against federer , stakhovsky got 72 percent of his first serves in and won 65 percent of his points at the net . against melzer , those numbers dropped to 62 and . you go out there and show him that i 'm not roger###federer and i can return his serve and make him play tough volleys , melzer said . that was my goal today . instead of looking at this as an opportunity lost , though , both stakhovsky and larcher de brito felt it was time well spent . as they walked off their respective courts and toward the locker###rooms friday , they did it with a security escort by their side , but otherwise in almost total obscurity stakhovsky stopping to sign three or four autographs , larcher de brito weaving her way quickly through a departing friday###night crowd . these , of course , were not the main memories they were taking###home from wimbledon . it was a fantastic win , obviously , larcher de brito said . it gave me an incredible amount of confidence and it proved to myself that , yeah , i can be there . and stakhovsky nobody 's going to take it away from me . if someone would ask me , 'would you rather beat roger and lose in the next round ? ' i would always take that , obviously .
london chelsea 's place among the world 's elite clubs must rely more on producing players from their academy than big###money signings to comply with uefa 's financial###fair###play rules , club chief###executive ron gourlay said on tuesday . in an interview to mark chelsea 's 10 years of ownership under big###spending roman###abramovich , gourlay told the club website ( www . chelseafc . com mr abramovich 's early investment in playing###staff paid###dividends in creating a team admired around the world . but to keep chelsea among the elite we have always known we must produce our own world###class talent and we are beginning to see the benefits of our academy . investment in the academy would help long###term objectives for financial###fair###play , he added . chelsea manager jose mourinho , back at the club after being in charge at real###madrid , has already embraced the new philosophy , saying he needed to look at improving the existing players at the club . ( my role ) is not to say to mr abramovich and members of the board , i need some money with a lot of zeros , mourinho , who led chelsea to successive premier###league titles in 2005 and , said on his return to the london club last month . financial###fair###play rules will be imposed by european soccer 's governing###body uefa next season . they are designed to stop reckless spending on wages and transfer###fees and curb large cash injections from rich club###owners . spending cannot exceed revenue from tv rights , gate###receipts , competition prize###money and sponsorship . clubs who break this rule face expulsion from european###competition . the first game of mourinho 's second term will be in bangkok on july 17 when the club play a thailand all star team as part of a tour of asia that takes in kuala###lumpur and jakarta .
chicago the chicago###bulls want to play rough , and they have made no secret of it . they have turned their second round eastern###conference playoff###series against the miami###heat into a black and blue affair , defined by bumps , bruises , elbows and shoves . but if the series is to become a war###of###attrition , as the bulls seem to hope it will , there is a key tactical###advantage enjoyed by the heat reinforcements . the heat have a roster chock full of all stars and a rotation that goes nine deep . the bulls , depleted by injury and illness , are surviving with their bench players from the regular###season playing the roles of starters and reserves . the bulls swingman jimmy butler understands what his team is up against , and he is the most extreme example of the task facing chicago trying to stave off the heat , as well as exhaustion . butler , who started only 20 games during the regular###season , is the only player to have played an entire###game this postseason . he has done it four times , including the bulls' final two games against the nets in the first round and game 1 against the heat . after getting to rest in game , he was back on the court for 48 minutes in friday 's game , a heat victory that gave them a 2 1 series lead . the bulls appear to have little choice , with coach tom###thibodeau being forced to lean heavily on whatever healthy bodies he has . he did not expect to have more options for monday###night 's game 4 at united###center . it makes it a lot easier to do it whenever you know you got guys that are supporting you , said butler , who is averaging . 9 points during the playoffs . like , 'it 's o.k . that you 're tired we know you 're going to fight through it . ' luol###deng , recovering from complications from a spinal###tap , has missed the last five games , and kirk###hinrich , sidelined with a left calf###injury , has missed the last six . before going down , they were leading the bulls in playoff minutes deng , at . 8 per game , remains the league###leader in the playoffs . in the five games without deng and hinrich , center joakim###noah has posted minutes totals of , 41 , 39 , 32 and . marco###belinelli , who averaged . 8 minutes during the regular###season , is up to 43 against miami . nate###robinson has made a similar jump , to . 3 from . 4 . by contrast , the heat 's stars are carrying playoff workloads consistent with their minutes in the regular###season . lebron###james . 3 minutes per game in the playoffs , dwyane###wade . 0 ) and chris###bosh . 7 ) are each within two minutes of their regular###season averages . wade and bosh are even playing slightly###fewer minutes in the playoffs . the situation was never more dire for the bulls than in game , when four of their starters eclipsed 40 minutes after nazr###mohammed was ejected for shoving james . the bench was essentially reduced to one player , taj###gibson , who played 22 minutes the rest of the reserves played a total of 14 ( 3 minutes for mohammed and 11 for marquis###teague . the heat outscored the bulls by 10 points in the fourth###quarter in their 104 94 win . thibodeau put the heavy workloads in the context of the quest for a championship . that 's normally what happens in the playoffs , he said . guys play extended minutes . most rotations are short . to his point , 11 players are averaging more than 40 minutes in the postseason while none eclipsed that mark during the regular###season . still , the bulls' case is different because thibodeau was already predisposed to riding his top contributors . deng led the league in minutes per game in each of the past two seasons . noah was averaging around 40 minutes per game before he was told he had plantar###fasciitis earlier this season . against the heat , the big minutes and the big defensive assignments have fallen to butler . he has guarded james , making butler 's playing time that much more grueling . he does so much , and he has the ball in his hands a lot , butler said . he plays every position on the floor , to tell you the truth . back to the basket , dribbling the ball up the floor . it 's tough it 's fun . james , who scored 12 points in the fourth###quarter of game , said we 're a deep team , and everyone is healthy . whether they 're playing 10 guys or , we feel like we continue to wear on teams . on sunday###afternoon , reports from the league office said mohammed would not be suspended for his shove . but the league did fine thibodeau , 000 for his comments after friday 's game , in which he said he felt james flopped on the play . it was a rare moment this postseason when chicago received good news on the availability of a player . with or without mohammed , though , the bulls' message remains the same . we have more than enough , thibodeau said .
bloomington , ind . victor###oladipo believes there is a song for every occasion , and to the resignation of his indiana teammates , those occasions include blinking , breathing and walking . all . the . time , will sheehey said . in the shower , oladipo turns into usher . strolling across campus , he belts out tyrese . after acing an exam , he croons gospel because , after all , he said , he must thank god . somehow , between serenades , oladipo carves some time out of his day , every day , to engage in a more strenuous outlet for entertaining the masses . the basketball court doubles as his stage , a hardwood showcase for showmanship . when the ball is in his hands and really , often even when it is not the audience better not look away . if it does , it could miss one of those moments of pure rapture a vicious block , a ridiculous dunk , an even more ridiculous almost dunk , like his behind the head snag of an errant alley###oop feb . 2 against michigan that merits at least a few dozen viewings on youtube . all elicit a reaction commonplace at assembly hall a deafening round of oh la dee po ! chants , preceded by a what just happened facial###expression mouth agape , eyes bulging , hands firmly on head . i 've###looked in the crowd sometimes , point###guard kevin ferrell said , and their faces are pretty much in shock . this season has strained the boundaries of credulity for oladipo , a 6 foot 5 junior who has blossomed from an undervalued recruit into a finalist for the wooden###award , given to the nation 's top player . he has helped indiana ( 26 5 ) win its first outright big ten championship since 1993 the clincher was a 72 71 victory at michigan on sunday and get in position to nab a no . 1 seed in the n.c.a.a . tournament . he fills a stat sheet with the zeal of a locavore at a farmers' market steals , rebounds , assists , points and blocks , all crammed onto the nightly r sum of perhaps the country 's most versatile , improved and exciting player . if zeller made it cool again for in state boys to play for the hoosiers , then it is oladipo who made indiana basketball just plain cool . i do n't###recall ever seeing a player here have the kind of energy , at both ends of the floor , that victor shows on an every game basis , said don fischer , the radio voice of indiana basketball for the last 40 years . i do n't know if we 'll see anybody quite like him for a long time . oladipo is at once efficient and electrifying , melding those treasured hoosier###state virtues of defense , hustle and offensive rebounding with a style as magnetic as his personality . he is averaging . 7 points and . 2 rebounds and , while often guarding the opposition 's best perimeter threat , leading the team in steals and deflections the most critical indicator , for coach tom crean and his staff , of a player 's defensive activity . oladipo 's defense , especially on the weak side , creates turnovers and , in turn , easy baskets that have sent his overall shooting###percentage skyrocketing , to . 4 percent from . 1 last season . an uncompromising work ethic he spends at least an extra 90 minutes every day practicing his shooting or ball handling has produced a refined jump shooter who , according to hoop math . com , has converted 50 percent of his 2 point jumpers , up from 24 percent . the dude 's always pressuring , always up in your grill , sheehey said . the former indiana player and coach dan###dakich was chatting with some of his old teammates recently when the subject turned to oladipo , and all agreed that they would loathe practicing against him . we all think we 're gladiators who survived coach knight and all that , said dakich , now an analyst###for###espn . in our little world , that 's a pretty good compliment . oladipo 's little world , until he arrived here in , was his home in a rural pocket of upper###marlboro , md . , about 20 miles east of washington , where the family 's closest neighbors are horses and cows . his parents , immigrants from nigeria who moved to the united###states more than 25 years###ago , relocated there before high###school , attracted by a bigger home in a safer area but also because his father , chris , enjoyed the seclusion . oladipo characterized him as isolated . when discussing his mother , joan , and his three sisters kristine , kendra and his twin , victoria oladipo laughed and cracked jokes . he said that the five of them should star in a television comedy . what would it be called ? oladipo said . the oladipos , what else ? but when the conversation turned to his relationship with his father , oladipo shifted in his chair , his voice dropping as he scanned the room .
phoenix arguing that medical###marijuana has been the most effective###treatment for their son 's seizure###disorder , the parents of a 5 year old boy filed a lawsuit here on monday to force state officials to include marijuana extracts oil like resins with very low###levels of the psychoactive ingredient thc as a legal product under the state 's medical###marijuana act . as it stands , the act , approved by voters in , allows patients to use any mixture or preparation made with dried marijuana flowers , like brownies . the boy 's parents , jacob and jennifer welton , have been crushing the flowers and mixing them into applesauce , which they say has become difficult for the boy to ingest after brain surgery last year compromised his ability to eat . they do not want to buy the extract , found on the black###market , for fear of being arrested . we 're not criminals , ms . welton , 30 , an enrollment adviser at the university of phoenix , said in an interview . we just want what 's best for our son . the weltons' legal###action opens a new front on the fight over legalizing marijuana for medicinal use across the country , focusing on very sick###children to highlight its potential###benefits . arizona 's statute has no age###restrictions patients under 18 can use medical###marijuana as long as a parent or legal###guardian is told of its potential###risks and is in charge of buying and administering it , among other requirements . but the maricopa###county attorney , bill montgomery , has said that patients can be criminally prosecuted for using extracts and other products that do not meet the definition of cannabis under the state 's criminal###code , which treats resin extracted from marijuana as an illegal narcotic . the couple lists mr . montgomery , gov . jan###brewer and will humble , the director of the arizona department of health###services , as defendants in its lawsuit . we 're taking a proactive measure , said emma a . andersson of the american###civil###liberties###union 's criminal###law reform project and the weltons' lead lawyer . rather than waiting for these parents to be criminally prosecuted , we 're asking the courts to clarify what the medical###marijuana law is . the weltons' approach has already scored victories and forged alliances in unlikely corners . in august , gov . chris###christie of new jersey , which has one of the nation 's strictest marijuana statutes , allowed dispensaries to provide edible products made with marijuana leaves or extract to children . on monday in michigan , state representative mike shirkey , a republican , introduced###legislation that would add edible products and extracts to the list of products deemed usable under the state 's medical###marijuana law , approved by voters in . utah does not have a medical###marijuana program , but a republican legislator there , state representative gage froerer , plans to propose a bill allowing the use of extracts to treat children . in an interview , mr . froerer said , with these low thc levels and the research i found coming from colorado and other states where the extracts are legal , you ask yourself , if this was one of your kids , would you want this product available ? through representatives , the defendants declined to comment while litigation was pending . still , in a recent blog post , mr . humble talked about the confusion caused by the different definitions of marijuana and cannabis in the state 's medical###marijuana law and criminal###code , saying that patients who use medical###marijuana and the dispensaries that sell to them may be exposed to criminal###prosecution if they have resin extracted from any part of a marijuana plant . mr . montgomery , in a wide ranging news conference last month , said one of his concerns was that the medical###marijuana law sets limits only on dispensing dried marijuana . 5 ounces per patient every 14 days making it hard to regulate the sale of resins and oils . last week , the food###and###drug###administration approved the country 's first studies on the marijuana compound cannabidiol , a nonpsychoactive marijuana component , as an antiseizure medication . some scientists believe the compound quiets the electrical and chemical activities in the brain that trigger seizures . extracts are often heavy on cannabidiol , with a negligible amount of thc . the parents of zander , the 5 year old boy here , decided to request medical###marijuana for him after watching a cnn documentary featuring the story of a girl from colorado whose seizures fell to a handful over eight months from about 300 per week . at that time , zander , who has cortical dysplasia , a genetic###defect , was facing the prospect of a third brain surgery . his daily seizures , which started when he was 9 months old , had made him unresponsive to emotional and physical prompts , ms . welton said . he was first given medical###marijuana seven weeks###ago , and since then he has been able to stand straighter , stack blocks and walk backward for the first time . ms . welton said extracts , in addition to being easier to ingest , can be taken in more precise doses than the plant . we tried so many other regular pharmaceutical medications . they do n't have the same stigma , but they did n't help him and sometimes they made him worse , said ms . welton , who has two other children . i would n't want any of my other kids using marijuana . but this is zander 's medication , and for the first time , i feel like there 's hope for him .
san###diego in an unmarked greenhouse , leafy bushes carpet an acre of land here tucked into the suburban###sprawl of southern###california . the seeds of the inedible , drought###resistant plants , called jatropha , produce a prize high quality oil that can be refined into low###carbon jet###fuel or diesel###fuel . the mere###existence of the bushes is an achievement . hailed about six years###ago as the next big###thing in biofuels , jatropha attracted hundreds of millions###of###dollars in investments , only to fall from favor as the recession set in and as growers discovered that the wild bush yielded too few seeds to produce enough petroleum to be profitable . but sgb , the biofuels company that planted the bushes , pressed on . thanks to advances in molecular###genetics and dna###sequencing technology , the san###diego start up has , in a few years , succeeded in domesticating jatropha , a process that once took decades . sgb is growing hybrid strains of the plant that produce biofuel in quantities that it says are competitive with petroleum priced at 99 a barrel . oil is around 100 a barrel . call it , as sgb does , jatropha . 0 . the company has deals to plant , 000 acres of jatropha in brazil , india and other countries expected to eventually produce about 70 million###gallons of fuel a year . that has attracted the interest of energy giants , airlines and other multinational companies seeking alternatives to fossil###fuels . they see jatropha as a hedge against spikes in petroleum prices and as a way to comply with government mandates that require the use of low###carbon fuels . it is one of the few biofuels that i think has the potential to supply a large fraction of the aviation###fuel currently used today , said jim rekoske , vice###president for renewable###energy and chemicals at honeywell , who has visited the company 's jatropha plantations in central###america . mr . rekoske and biofuel analysts say sgb 's biggest###challenge will be to replicate the yields it generates in the greenhouse on a commercial###scale . given that this crop has somewhat of a checkered past , ultimately getting growers to plant the crop is going to be the key hurdle , says michael cox , an analyst at piper###jaffray . at the greenhouse , the fruits of sgb 's technology are apparent . a typical wild jatropha bush will produce a cluster of six to eight seed bearing fruits , according to robert schmidt , a specialist in corn genetics who is sgb 's chief###scientist . he picked up a grapefruit size cluster growing on a hybrid jatropha plant and counted 37 fruits . we have examples in guatemala where we have 60 fruits in a cluster , dr . schmidt said . sgb 's success at improving jatropha seed yields by as much as 900 percent persuaded a consortium that includes airbus , bp and the inter###american###development###bank to sign a deal with the company to plant , 000 acres of jatropha in brazil . the consortium , called jetbio , aims to develop sources of biofuel for the airline###industry as the european###union , australia and other countries impose caps on aviation carbon###emissions . the demand is huge every single airline would like to be flying on biofuel today , rafael davidsohn abud , jetbio 's managing###partner , said in an email . jatropha 's value as a cash###crop , though , may pale compared with a potential genetic gold mine sgb has begun to discover , identifying traits , for instance , that make certain strains of the plant resistant to extreme###heat or cold . if you figure out how to do heat tolerance for corn or soybeans , what is that trait worth as climate###change accelerates ? asked arama kukutai , managing###director at finistere ventures , a san###diego venture###capital###firm that has invested in sgb . for now , sgb plans to license its technology to energy companies . but the company is securing patents on its hybridization process , creating a technology platform that can be deployed to discover genetic###traits in other agricultural###crops .
milwaukee for three quarters wednesday###night , the nets looked overmatched by the milwaukee###bucks and their electric point###guard brandon###jennings . jennings , a 6 foot 1 inch dynamo , repeatedly made his counterparts , deron###williams and c . j . watson , look old and slow in staking the bucks to a 76 65 lead late in the third quarter . then the nets showed up . what began in the third quarter and continued into the fourth was a 14 0 run that catapulted the nets to a 97 94 victory at bmo###harris###bradley###center . it was their fourth###win in a row and second in two nights over the bucks . and with the season 's playoff push in sight , it was in the nets' view a strong statement . it 's really big , because this is a game that could have gone the other way , coach p . j . carlesimo said . we could have lost this one by 14 or 18 and said , you know , hey , it was a back to back . gerald###wallace simplified his coach 's message , saying , like p . j . said , we 're in playoff mode . the game changing run began innocently enough with a free###throw by wallace and a basket by andray###blatche to cut the bucks' lead to 8 going into the fourth . the final period could not have been scripted better for the nets . c . j . watson made a layup , monta###ellis turned the ball over , marshon###brooks made a layup , ellis missed a shot and brooks hit a 3 pointer . blatche then knocked down another shot , and brooks hit two more free throws . in less than four minutes , the nets ( 33 22 ) turned the 76 65 deficit into a 79 76 lead . they then held on for dear###life , emerging with the win only after ellis missed the first two of three free throws ( he missed the last on purpose ) after he was fouled by williams attempting a 3 pointer with . 4 seconds###left . jennings , who scored 34 points against the nets on tuesday in brooklyn , again was the bucks' catalyst for most of wednesday 's game . he hit his first nine shots of the game and had 26 points entering the fourth###quarter , but scored only 5 in the fourth . we just tried to make things hard on him , trapping him a little more on the pick and rolls , williams said of defending jennings in crunch time . he 's just one of those players when he 's hot , when he gets it going , he 's almost impossible to stop . williams , playing his second game after missing the final two games before the all star break to get treatment on his ailing ankles , led the nets with 23 points . there was some concern over how he would recover for the second game in as many nights . i felt pretty good , williams said , before adding he will get cortisone shots on his ankles thursday . despite any lingering soreness , though , williams was effective in his 33 minutes , if not flashy or dominating . his 3 pointer with 1 minute 50 seconds###left gave the nets a 94 83 lead and sent many bucks fans to the exits . williams was backed up by the nets' bench , which scored 47 points . watson accounted for 17 of them , shooting 7 for 11 from the field . his driving layup with . 5 seconds remaining gave the nets a 96 92 lead after a layup by jennings made it a one possession game . blatche added , and brooks had . carlesimo called watson 's recent play enormous , adding , he has n't been good , he 's been very , very good . the bucks , thanks in large part to jennings 's 11 first quarter points , built an 8 point lead by the end of the opening quarter . they stretched it to 12 by halftime . the nets , after having lost 13 straight to the bucks entering tuesday 's game , suddenly find themselves with two straight###wins against their former nemesis . before wednesday 's win , the nets had not won in milwaukee since march , 2009 . the victory also moved the nets to a game behind the knicks for first place in the eastern###conference 's atlantic###division . with the game over and the nets suddenly on a roll again in a topsy###turvy season , attention will now shift to the trade rumors that have swirled around the team for the better part of the past several weeks . while a trade appeared unlikely by thursday 's 3 p.m . deadline , carlesimo would not rule it out . asked before the game if he thought his team would look the same thursday as it did wednesday , he replied , i do n't know .
the term warrior is often overused when it comes to athletes . but the red###bulls' coach , mike###petke , felt it fit in describing tim###cahill 's game long resolve in fighting through an injury . cahill , a red###bulls midfielder who recently helped his native australia qualify for next summer 's world###cup in brazil , will miss the next three to four weeks of the major###league###soccer season after sustaining a knee###injury last saturday . the injury occurred in the fourth minute of the red###bulls' 4 3 win over visiting real###salt###lake at red###bull###arena . cahill played on , scored a goal and left the match in the game 's 85th minute before his team 's furious rally snatched the full three points . cahill sustained a torn posterior###cruciate###ligament on a tackle by r.s.l . 's yordany alvarez , for which alvarez was shown a yellow###card . minutes later , cahill scored on a header off a free###kick from thierry###henry . it 's a very big loss to us , petke said during his weekly conference call . like i said , i think it was a very reckless and careless challenge . i do n't think it was intentional . i do n't think salt###lake plays like that , but i think it was just a very careless challenge to the knee and it 's going to be a very big loss for us . in his first full season with the red###bulls , cahill has emerged as the midfield engine for the club , especially since the recent departure of the brazilian juninho . he has six goals and and three assists in 19 starts this season . the injury forced cahill to withdraw from wednesday###night 's game between the m.l.s . all stars and roma of italy , won by the italian club , 3 1 , in kansas###city , kan . cahill will also miss saturday 's critical eastern###conference match between the second place red###bulls , 35 points ) and first place sporting###kansas###city , 36 ) at sporting park . first of all it shows what kind of mentality and what a warrior he is , that he played throughout that game , petke said . he added , that 's soccer , that 's life and we have to figure out ways to just get on without him . after the match at kansas###city , the red###bulls play at columbus ( aug . 10 ) , against philadelphia ( aug . 17 ) , at chivas###usa ( aug . 25 ) and against d.c . united ( aug . 31 ) . the red###bulls' other designated###player , the captain thierry###henry , played 57 minutes for the m.l.s . stars against roma and remained in kansas###city ahead of saturday 's match .
boston the bruins on monday played like the relentless team that swept the penguins from the playoffs . and they did not need overtime to prove it . tuukka###rask 's superb goaltending and goals from daniel###paille and patrice###bergeron helped throttle the blackhawks , 2 0 , at td###garden and give boston a 2 1 advantage in the stanley###cup###finals . it was the first game in the series decided in regulation . game 4 is wednesday here . we 're playing the best hockey of the season right now , bruins coach claude julien said . that 's what you 've got to do to give yourself a chance to win a stanley###cup . the blackhawks never seemed to recover from the loss of marian hossa , whose 15 playoff###points are tied for the team lead , to a freak injury in warm###ups . paille , who notched the overtime###winner in game , opened the scoring as he twirled near the right circle and wristed the puck past goaltender corey###crawford at 2 minutes 13 seconds of the second period . later in the period paille 's speed and hustle helped###set up the second goal when he burst past chicago defenseman niklas###hjalmarsson and drew a tripping penalty with 11 seconds still left in a boston power play . zdeno chara gave jaromir###jagr the puck to the side of the net , and jagr fired a pinpoint pass through the goal mouth to bergeron at the other side . crawford slid across and almost made the save , but bergeron buried the chance just after the first chicago penalty expired . the 41 year old jagr , who was criticized by the television analyst mike###milbury for being too old and too slow during game , played another effective game . though he has not scored in the postseason , he has eight assists . i 'm not that fast anymore , but i still can see , jagr joked when asked if he saw bergeron open when he made the pass . give me some credit . bergeron had a mammoth game , leading both teams with seven shots on goal while winning a remarkable 24 of 28 face###offs . he was the biggest hero of the bruins' record###setting comeback from a three goal###deficit in game 7 against toronto in the opening round , when he scored the game###tying###goal with 51 seconds###left###in###regulation , and the winner in overtime . on monday he talked about the completeness of the bruins' effort . it 's about the little details that go unnoticed , but not by us , bergeron said . in the boston goal , tuukka###rask remained###virtually unbeatable . he stopped all 28 shots , logging his third shutout in seven games and boosting his series save###percentage to . 960 . but the bruins' defense made sure that most of the shots he faced came from the perimeter . without hossa , the already sputtering blackhawks offense sputtered further . they have not scored since patrick###sharp 's first period goal in game , a span of 26 . hossa seemed to hurt himself trying to take a shot in warm###ups . chicago coach joel###quenneville , who would only say that it was an upper body injury and that hossa 's status was day to day , said that his absence was not the reason for the loss . it 's a low chance game it 's a low chance series , quenneville said . it 's hard to get a plus chances . jonathan###toews , with only one goal and eight assists in the playoffs , was smothered for a third straight game by chara and his defense partner , dennis###seidenberg . quenneville tried to place toews with different sets of wings in an effort to get him free of the pair , but nothing worked . patrick###kane , another blackhawks big###gun , seemed tentative at times without hossa on his line . at one point in the second period , he broke in on rask but declined to shoot until too late , allowing rask to make an easy save . the bruins' penalty killers repelled four chicago###power plays . they have not allowed a power###play###goal in 26 straight attempts , stretching back to dan girardi 's goal in game 5 of their second round victory over the rangers . hossa was replaced by ben###smith , who had played only one game this season for chicago he skated a team low 10 minutes and was on the ice for paille 's goal . the 6 foot , 255 pound chara was also injured during warm###ups when he collided with the , 220 pound milan###lucic , sending both crashing to the ice . chara sustained a cut over his left###eye that required stitches to close , but he played the entire###game . with 12 seconds###left in the game , as the blackhawks pulled their goalie and tried in vain to put a goal on the board , chara wrestled with bryan bickell , and chicago 's andrew shaw threw a punch at boston 's brad###marchand . but the bruins held firm .
scientists' discovery that rodents , bats and nonhuman###primates have a system in the brain for what amounts to dead###reckoning navigation is one of the most important brain research developments of the past few decades . the system is built on what are called grid cells , neurons that emit pulses of electricity in a regular pattern that maps the animal 's movement . scientists predicted they would find grid cells in humans , and now they have . j oshua jacobs of drexel###university in philadelphia and a team of scientists including michael j . kahana at the university of pennsylvania and dr . itzhak fried at u.c.l.a . and tel###aviv###university , reported in nature###neuroscience on sunday that signals from electrodes implanted in human patients with severe epilepsy proved the presence of grid cells that function in the same way as those found in other mammals . it completes the picture , said edvard i . moser of the norwegian university of science and technology , one of the discoverers of grid cells . it 's a significant###contribution . dr . jacobs said the research was important to do because , although it had seemed likely that grid cells existed in human###beings , it was far from certain . it 's not at all clear that humans and rodents behave in the same manner , he said . an area of the brain where grid cells are found in rats , and now in humans , the entorhinal###cortex , is often damaged in the early###stages of alzheimer 's disease , so knowing how the navigation system works is important , dr . jacobs said . the scientists also located grid cells in another brain area in humans , the cingulate###cortex , where , dr . jacobs said , they have not been found in rats . the research involved the collaboration of neurosurgeons , research neuroscientists , and 14 patients with drug###resistant epilepsy , who had electrodes implanted in their brains to locate the source of the seizures before surgery . the patients volunteered to play a video###game in which they navigated a virtual###environment analysis of brain cell activity recorded during the game playing provided the data for analysis . the same patterns characteristic of rodent grid cells were found in humans as they navigated , dr . jacobs said , showing that humans are using the same neural mechanism .
the genuine article can only be found at petkemike , though do not expect an effusive dissection of the red###bulls' latest game or strategy because the most recent entry is from aug . 29 , preceded by one from aug . 6 ( in which the coach wishes his wife a happy###birthday . the only social###media i 'm on is twitter because red###bull asked me to join a couple of years###ago when i was still playing , petke said during his weekly telephone conference call . i love it , but it 's been awhile since i 've posted . but my phone beeps every time i 'm mentioned on twitter . i 'm not really sure how to turn those things off . he added i have a hands on , interested , extended###family and close###friends and i get calls all the time telling me what was said online . i do go to take a look , but only to make sure my players are saying the right thing . it is clear that petke is more concerned with what his players do rather than what they say . the coach 's men have won three straight###games in major###league###soccer and are alone in first place in the eastern###conference with five regular###season matches left to play . in his rookie###season as the team 's head###coach , petke acknowledged that the most difficult###transition has been in dealing with player management , massaging egos and picking the right spots to speak to his players . the league has changed , there are more teams , more players , more personalities , he said . and you also throw in all that social###media stuff , the players are under a microscope and they are getting critiqued at all angles . it makes the players a little more touchy . they ask why they 're not starting because it 's all over facebook , mlssoccer . com and twitter . it 's blowing up . i call it the lebron syndrome , after lebron###james . he came out of high###school and was given a huge contract before anyone knew if he could play in the league . you look around our league and there are some who would rather that than to earn it , and when things do n't fall their way it 's a touchy situation . it 's just a different day and age . that may sound like an older###man speaking , though petke is only , a young 37 at that . with two days off after saturday 's 2 0 win over visiting toronto , the red###bulls , 48 points ) are hoping for the return of at least some of the club 's injured###players ahead of the sunday###evening match against visiting dallas . tim###cahill , who was on the bench last week but did not play , will again be available for action after dealing with a knee###injury . defender brandon barklage is again fit , but roy miller , lloyd sam and connor lade remain questionable . as the end of the regular###season approaches , petke said that he would like to settle on a starting###lineup , though the situation is fluid and he is open to adjustment based on performance in games and training . i will never compromise something for the sake of stability , he said . i 'm not against a set lineup . if someone in a starting###position is having a phenomenal week in training i 'll stick with him . if not , i 'm not afraid to make changes .
shenandoah###national###park , va . sally###jewell bounded up a granite boulder near the peak of old rag mountain and turned back to her hiking companion , who was staring up at the smooth rock that offered no obvious hand or footholds . trust your feet , she said . that mountaineer 's mantra has carried ms . jewell through a lifetime of challenging ascents and a varied###career as petroleum engineer , banker and retail executive . on april , she was sworn in as the 51 st secretary of the interior . ms . jewell , 57 , who has climbed###mount rainier seven times along with some of the world 's highest###peaks , said that she is happiest on the steepest part of the learning###curve . a woman of untamed energy , competitiveness and confidence in the boardroom and on a mountain trail , she is undertaking perhaps the greatest###challenge of her life as she assumes###command of a huge bureaucracy in a city that festers barely above sea###level . until president obamatapped her as interior###secretary to succeed ken###salazar , a former democratic senator from colorado , ms . jewell was chief###executive of recreational equipment inc . in kent , wash . , a suburb of seattle . she has never held elective###office , though she has served as member of the board of trustees of the university of washington and at a variety of nonprofits . she has spent little time in what residents of the pacific###northwest call the other washington . like many successful corporate titans who have come to washington before her , she will learn that running a business or a university board is not necessarily adequate###training for a top government post . she noted during a five hour round###trip hike of old rag , for example , that no rational business###executive would cut an operating###budget across the board , as the federal budget###process known as the sequester requires . and she said that no matter how determined she is to spend her time promoting outdoor###recreation or increasing renewable###energy production , events can rudely intrude . you never know what 's going to hit you in a job like this , she said . for secretary salazar , very unfortunate , but the deepwater###horizon spill happened relatively early in his term and it took an enormous amount of time and energy that one has to deal with . things###happen . earthquakes happen . natural###disasters happen . the american west is a tinderbox right now . ms . jewell underwent weeks of grueling briefings for what turned out to be a relatively mild senate confirmation###hearing . the toughest questions from republicans concerned her role on the board of the national###parks###conservation###association , a mainly volunteer###group that advocates for parks and park employees and that has sometimes sued the federal###government . senators largely glossed over the major missions of the interior###department , including supervising oil###drilling on public###lands and waters , protecting endangered###species , managing millions of acres of public###lands , coping with climate###change and coordinating federal relations with hundreds of american###indian###tribes . before taking###office , she spent scores of hours with senior political and career employees in a small conference###room at the department headquarters in foggy###bottom , learning the physics of oil###spill containment gear , the habitat of the gunnison sage grouse and the politics of an obscure road building###project through the izembek wilderness of alaska . she likened the experience to drinking from a fire hose . she professed not to be overawed by taking###charge of an agency with an 11 billion###budget , 70 , 000 employees and stewardship of 20 percent of the territory of the united###states . well , i 'm not scared of it , she said in an interview at the peak of the , 291 foot old rag , one of the most popular hiking spots near washington , after she scampered up a trail that rose , 500 feet over roughly three miles . ms . jewell was slowed only by a party that included two park officers , a press aide , a bodyguard , a reporter and a photographer , none of them as fit and agile as she . you ca n't###possibly come into a job like this and expect to know what you 're doing right out of the gate , she said . you have to listen to very , very smart people who know what they 're doing and who can help you prioritize . ms . jewell was born in england and came to the united###states at the age of . she said her father , peter roffey , an anesthesiologist , had moved the family because he was uncomfortable with england 's ossified class system . he died in . her mother , anne , who died in , was a nurse###practitioner who specialized in women 's health . ms

paris jo###wilfried###tsonga continued his march towards a potential french###open quarter###final with roger###federer by reaching the fourth###round with a 6 1 6 2 7 5 win over fellow frenchman jeremy chardy on friday . sixth###seed tsonga , the highest###ranked french player in the either singles draw , next meets serbian viktor###troicki . i was more solid than in the previous round , said tsonga in a courtside interview . asked how he would spend his day off , he replied i 'm not going shopping because i 'm not allowed to ... i 'm not allowed to cuddle either because it 's energy sapping . there 's not much i 'm allowed to do so i 'm going to practice . tsonga , who has yet to drop a set , took 102 minutes to dispose of australian###open quarter###finalist chardy on court philippe chatrier . the 28 year old tsonga , as usual , relied on a big serve and a booming forehand and ended 25th seed chardy 's ordeal on his second match###point with a service winner . tsonga said he loved playing on courts made heavy by damp weather . i feel good when it 's heavy because it gives me time to strike the ball and also gives me time to run from one ball to the next because it 's going slower , he told a news conference . i can have my power from the baseline felt by the opponent . french 15th seed gilles###simon also reached the fourth###round when he beat american sam querrey . but there was double despair for france after wildcard gael monfils 's 2 6 6 7 ( 5 ) 6 2 7 6 ( 3 ) 6 2 defeat by tommy###robredo of spain and julien benneteau 's 6 3 6 4 7 5 loss to roger###federer . monfils , who has recently been hampered by a nagging knee###injury , wasted four match###points before crumbling in the decider . earlier , home hopes marion###bartoli and richard###gasquet advanced to the third round . bartoli , seeded 13 in the women 's event , battled past colombian qualifier mariana###duque 7 6 ( 5 ) 7 5 to set up a clash with former champion francesca###schiavone of italy .
morristown , n.j . mark###sanchez predicted tuesday that he would be better than ever when his football career resumed . and he insisted the jets would reap the benefits . speaking publicly for the first time since shoulder###surgery oct . 8 , sanchez was unequivocal in proclaiming his desire to return to the jets next season . absolutely , said sanchez , who was volunteering at a soup###kitchen here . there 's no doubt about that . it 's been a dream###come###true to play here , and i do n't want to go anywhere else . he added , i love being a jet , and i plan on being here . plans can certainly change , as sanchez learned aug . 24 , when his hopes of starting at quarterback were destroyed by a crushing hit in the fourth###quarter of a preseason###game against the giants that left him with a torn###labrum . even before that night , sanchez , 27 , signed through , seemed unlikely to return next season . his prohibitive contract , combined with his performance over the last two seasons and the organization 's rebuilding phase , made him a strong candidate to be released , or traded , before he is owed a 2 million roster bonus in march . sanchez counts . 1 million against the salary###cap in , and the jets would save . 3 million by cutting him after the season . i know i 've###heard a lot of stuff on the outside of me not being here and stuff like that , but i do n't know if that 's necessarily the case in the building , sanchez said . hopefully not . hopefully i 'm a jet . that 's what i am , that 's what i want to be . before sanchez can play again , he must rehabilitate his shoulder . he declined to give a timetable for his recovery , or when he anticipated being cleared to resume throwing , but he indicated he should be healthy by april . the way things are coming along , sanchez said , it sounds like i 'll be bionic . he has divided his time among california , where he is from , the team 's headquarters in new jersey and the offices of his surgeon , dr . james###andrews , in alabama and florida . he has stayed involved with the jets by undertaking film study projects for the offensive###coordinator , marty###mornhinweg , and watching tape of their practices and games and , as warranted , delivering pep talks to geno###smith . few people can empathize more with smith than sanchez , who was surrounded by more offensive talent as a rookie but endured similar struggles and was prone to turnovers . one difference is that sanchez had supreme job###security early in his career , while smith does not . i know , i 've been there , sanchez said . i 've totally experienced a lot of the things he 's going through . this has been a lost season for sanchez , who will need to prove himself capable of leading an n.f.l . offense again . he said he viewed his injury as a blessing###in###disguise , though , because it allowed him to gain fresh###perspective on his career , and , potentially , where it is heading . he seemed energized by the prospect of analyzing film of the patriots' victory sunday against denver and what he might learn from it . i think that stuff will help me in the future , absolutely , sanchez said . i think it could be a jump###start . could be fun .

tallahassee , fla . the florida###state crowd , a doak###campbell###stadium record of , 409 , decided it was going to be impatient , brush off the final month of the season , ignore unbeatens oregon and ohio###state , and just declare what was on its mind . the no . 3 seminoles were finishing up a 41 14 thumping of no . 7 miami on saturday###night to improve to , 6 0 in the atlantic###coast###conference when the fans' chorus started . some of the f.s.u . players said they did not hear it , or pretended not to hear . junior nose###tackle tim jernigan reveled in the crowd 's glee . he heard , loud and clear , and was asked , do you want no . 1 alabama , like the crowd ? florida###state , molded in the likeness of alabama and nick###saban by coach jimbo###fisher , bears a resemblance to the powerhouse tide . the seminoles are a complementary football###team of physical offense , fast closing defenders and solid special teams , just like alabama , and they proved it saturday . the seminoles were physical , rushing for 192 yards and allowing just . the seminoles were efficient , scoring on all six trips in the red###zone . they converted 11 of 15 third downs and pressured the quarterback stephen###morris ( two sacks , one hurry . they were solid on special teams allowing only . 9 yards on kick returns . these are all hallmarks of saban 's team . fisher worked with saban at louisiana###state and he recruits the same type of players as saban . fisher summed up his seminoles team in a few simple###words after their 27 point dismantling of the hurricanes , 3 1 ) , in the last game between two unbeatens this season . we are a great team , he said , the seminoles backing that up by outscoring their last four opponents , 204 45 . here was the key evidence to support fisher 's assessment . the redshirt###freshman jameis###winston , who was ranked second nationally in passing###efficiency , finally played like a first year starter and threw two first half interceptions . he sailed throws over his receivers heads and looked spooked by the atmosphere of a big rivalry###game . florida###state led just 21 14 at the half in a game it was favored to win by 22 points because winston was wobbly . yet , the seminoles were still in control of the game emotionally at halftime . they had adjusted to miami 's running###game after the hurricanes' second series . duke johnson led miami with 97 rushing###yards , but he found things much more difficult as the game progressed . when winston regained his form in the second half , florida###state pulled away . he completed all seven of his passes in the third quarter as the seminoles scored###two###touchdowns to stretch their lead to . i told guys at halftime i was n't going to commit another turnover , they know i meant business , winston said . when it 's coming out of my mouth i mean it . the game , one of the most highly###anticipated in florida in the last 10 years , was a revival of the passionate games the teams###played in the 1980s and '90s , when the teams claimed six national###titles between them . florida###state disappeared from the national stage because of an academic scandal and a bitter separation with coach bobby###bowden . miami lost to ohio###state in the championship game after the 2002 season and then started its slide out of the national picture , just as the southeastern###conference began to move into prominence . the hurricanes also endured a scandal , involving a rogue booster , which has just recently been resolved . the sec capitalized on the downturns by miami and florida###state to snatch recruits to help the conference win seven straight national###championships , including two by the florida###gators . miami , in its third season under coach al golden , is not as far along in its revival as the seminoles , but the fact florida###state is hunting a national###championship is motivation enough for the hurricanes to climb back toward the national stage . fisher might even motivate them more because he called a timeout to kick a field###goal with 1 minute 3 seconds remaining . playing for the state championship of florida is more important to some guys than playing for the national###championship , said twan russell , who played for miami in the mid 1990s and is the director of youth and community programs for the miami###dolphins . the national###ranking is a byproduct . the reason these games are so spectacular is they are fighting for something not tangible . you 're fighting for pride . it 's a different kind of fight .
the laboratory of vera gorbunova and andrei seluanov , a husband###and###wife###team of biologists at the university of rochester , has the feel of a petting###zoo . they maintain colonies of several species of rodents some familiar , like mice and guinea###pigs , and some much more exotic , like blind mole###rats from israel and naked mole###rats from east###africa . amusing children with furry creatures is not their goal , however . the biology of animals is mysteriously diverse , and lurking within it may be clues to new kinds of medicine . even the strangest creatures may hold a valuable surprise . and in the latest###issue of the journal nature , dr . gorbunova , dr . seluanov and their colleagues report a particularly fascinating surprise naked mole###rats produce a unique compound that appears to block them from getting cancer . rochelle buffenstein , who studies the biology of naked mole###rats at the university###of###texas###health###science###center , called the discovery by dr . gorbunova and dr . seluanov intriguing and most unexpected . she is hopeful that the naked###mole###rat 's secrets may inspire new treatments for cancer . dr . gorbunova and dr . seluanov are hopeful as well they 're now investigating whether the compound can protect mice from cancer . we think this mechanism could be moved into humans , dr . gorbunova said . studying cancer in animals is nothing new , of course . scientists regularly test out potential cancer drugs on mice . more recently , however , researchers have started to appreciate the differences among various species . lab mice are especially prone to cancer , for example 47 percent of them develop tumors of one sort or another . naked mole###rats , on the other hand , have a profoundly different sort of life . they can live more than 30 years , and scientists have yet to find a single mole###rat with cancer . to understand this phenomenon , scientists have examined the naked mole###rats' cells . they 've infected them with viruses that reliably trigger cancer in mouse cells , finding that their efforts###fail utterly in naked###mole###rat cells . this resistance has inspired dr . gorbunova and dr . seluanov to figure out the naked###mole###rat 's secret . there 's a lot to be learned from cancerproof rodents , dr . gorbunova said . in , dr . gorbunova and dr . seluanov found an intriguing clue to how naked mole###rats escape cancer . in humans , mice and most other mammals , cells will grow and divide until they bump into other cells . the contact causes them to stop dividing or even die off . this response called contact inhibition stops cells from multiplying out of control . but dr . gorbunova , dr . seluanov and their colleagues discovered that naked###mole###rat cells are much more sensitive to other cells . they stop growing at a third the density that the mouse cells do . they also discovered that raising naked###mole###rat cells can be frustrating . to raise cells , scientists put them in a liquid full of nutrients . after a few days , the scientists noticed , naked###mole###rat cells turn that liquid to syrup . we said , 'we need to find out what this goo is , ' said dr . gorbunova . their postdoctoral###researcher , christopher hine ( now at harvard , discovered that the goo was made up of chain shaped molecules called hyaluronan . hyaluronan is a common molecule in human bodies it 's an ingredient in the stretchy gel in which our cells are embedded . it also sends signals into our cells by latching onto a receptor on cells called cd . the signals can deliver commands to cells to change course to start multiplying in some cases , for example . the rochester team found that the bodies of naked mole###rats are loaded with high levels of hyaluronan . but they discovered something else naked mole###rats make a form of hyaluronan that 's five times as long as the kind made by mice or humans . the scientists wondered if this long hyaluronan helped naked mole###rats fight cancer . they added hyaluronan destroying enzymes to populations of naked###mole###rat cells to see what would happen . instead of arresting their growth at a low###density , the cells now grew into thick clusters , just as cancer prone mouse cells do . the scientists next shut down the gene in naked###mole###rat cells that encodes hyaluronan . they then inserted a cancer causing virus . instead of resisting the virus , the hyaluronan free cells multiplied wildly . and when the researchers moved the naked###mole###rat cancer###cells into mice , the cells grew into full blown tumors . suddenly , naked###mole###rat cells became as vulnerable to cancer as mouse cells or human cells . dr . gorbunova and dr . seluanov suspect that the long form of hyaluronan made by naked mole###rats did n't originally evolve to fight cancer . hyaluronan helps make skin stretchy , and naked mole###rats are especially stretchy . if you grab an animal , it feels like you 're removing their skin , dr . seluanov said . the long form of hyaluronan may have first evolved as an important adaptation for animals that have to wiggle through tight , rocky tunnels underground . it may have been a fortunate accident that the molecule also sent a signal to cells through the cd44 receptor that stopped them from becoming cancerous . hyaluronan probably is n't the only way to fight off cancer . blind mole###rats ( which , despite their name , are not close###relatives of naked mole###rats ) rarely get cancer either . but the research dr . gorbunova and dr . seluanov have conducted on those rodents suggests that they fight cancer by sending a different signal to fast growing cells , causing them to commit###suicide . maybe in blind mole###rats , evolution chose another path , dr . gorbunova said . like many candidates for cancer drugs , naked###mole###rat hyaluronan may well turn out to be a failure . but nature has other drugs in its cabinet left to try .

boston tyler melling is a class a pitcher who was 3 4 this season with a . 93 earned###run###average . because he is employed by the st . louis###cardinals , who turn prospects of all pedigrees into stars , there is a strong chance melling will somehow win 15 games in the majors next season . for now , his position is whistle###blower . by the time jon###lester took the field at fenway###park on thursday , before game 2 of the world###series , melling still had fewer than , 000 twitter followers . but his post about lester on wednesday , when lester twirled a gem for the boston###red###sox in an 8 1 opening victory , had already caused a stir . melling deleted the message thursday , but by then his question about lester and vaseline had grown to a loud rumble around the internet . melling posted a screen shot of lester on the mound in game , with a greenish glob between the top of the thumb and the webbing on the inside of his glove , and wrote that it might be vaseline . the picture does look bad , but it 's resin , lester said . that 's all i can really comment on , is it 's resin . my next start , game , i 'll go out there and do the exact same thing and hopefully have the same outcome in the game . lester said he tossed the rosin bag in his glove before every game , no matter the weather , so he could go to it quickly when he needed a better grip on the ball . he said that keeping some resin there instead of reaching for the rosin bag on the back slope of the mound helped him maintain his tempo . he also said it was a necessity for keeping sweat off the ball . i 've###played with jon basically my whole professional career he kind of sweats a lot , man , second baseman dustin###pedroia said . i know he loads up with resin all over the place . i do n't even like going out there and telling him 'good job' and patting him on the back , because you get all wet and stuff . manager john###farrell said categorically that lester had resin , and nothing else , in his glove , and that he had always used it to help his grip . why , then , did the substance appear to be green ? farrell had no answer for that , and lester struggled to find one . it looks like a giant booger almost , lester said . i do n't know how that came about , with the lighting or whatever . i saw the picture i do n't know how that is . but like i said , it 's resin . i guess with sweat and licking your fingers , and rubbing your fingers in there , it may turn a different color i do n't know . i do n't###pay attention to that stuff when i 'm pitching . i use the rosin bag . that 's all i can say about it . the suggestion that lester might have applied a foreign substance to the ball to gain an edge had overtones of the 2006 world###series , when the detroit###tigers' kenny###rogers humbled the cardinals in game . the important###difference is that the cardinals raised the issue with the umpires during that game and did not on wednesday . on thursday , the cardinals dismissed the lester uproar as nothing more than a hubbub on social###media . major###league###baseball said it had drawn no conclusions from video of lester , adding that the umpires had not noticed a foreign substance . this was not instigated by us , and the way that we approach it is we just play the game , cardinals manager mike###matheny said . we do n't###deny that some things have been acknowledged , and if that 's what he claims , that 's what it is . that 's all there is to it , and right now , it 's pretty much a dead issue . lester worked seven and two thirds shutout###innings wednesday , allowing five hits and a walk . cardinals outfielder shane robinson said nothing had seemed unusual about lester 's stuff his ball had a natural cut into right handers , just as the hitters had seen on video . lester said he considered it a compliment that someone might think that he was so good he had to be cheating . i know what i do day in and day out to prepare to pitch big###league games , and i know not once i 've cheated , lester said . i wo n't cheat . i 'll continue to hold that as part of who i am . derek###lowe , the former red###sox pitcher , said pitchers could apply lots of hair###spray and run their hands through their hair for a better grip , and that would be legal . he mentioned that hitters use pine###tar to keep a grip on the bat . doctoring a ball with sandpaper is clearly wrong , lowe said , but using resin to grip the ball is common and is not cheating . it 's not about what he had in his glove , said pedro###martinez , a teammate of lowe 's in . it 's about how bad st . louis came out to play . they did not execute . they did not do anything right , and lester had everything going on for him . that 's all you had to look at st . louis was flat . lester had his good stuff and he beat them . that 's it , clean and simple . clean and simple , but with a little bit of green resin mixed in .
east###rutherford , n.j . ugly . sloppy . and , rex###ryan will take it . the new york jets overcame a team record 20 penalties and hung on to beat the buffalo###bills 27 20 on sunday as geno###smith outplayed ej###manuel in a matchup of the first two quarterbacks drafted in april . i love the fact that our team found a way to win , ryan said . we persevered and we won . that 's really encouraging to me . that tells you about the fight and spirit of this football###team . and that 's what i 'm most proud of . even if it was far from the prettiest of victories for the jets , who became the first team to get called for that many penalties and win since the browns beat the bears in 1951 despite being penalized 21 times . they did it with smith 's 69 yard touchdown pass to santonio###holmes in the fourth###quarter that stood as the winning score . we were able to get the game to , bills coach doug###marrone said , but then we were not able to make the plays to get us over the hump . here are five things to know from the jets' victory over the bills 1 . plethora of penalties buffalo could n't take full advantage of new york 's barrage of penalties , which accounted for 168 yards and nearly sent the jets to a loss . capping a drive kept alive by four straight penalties on the jets , including three on kyle wilson , manuel connected with scott chandler for a 33 yard touchdown and then hit stevie###johnson with a pass for a 2 point conversion that tied it at 20 with 39 left in the game . we made our mistakes , but they made 20 penalties and we did n't###win , johnson said . we have to find a way to get it done with that kind of help . buffalo had seven penalties for 87 yards , a minuscule number compared to the jets . 2 . geno outdoes ej smith insisted he was n't out to prove anything to buffalo after the bills passed on drafting him and instead took manuel at no . 16 overall . but he came through with one of the biggest plays of the game , connecting with holmes on the go ahead score . smith , the second quarterback drafted at no . 39 , finished 16 of 29 for 331 yards and touchdown passes to holmes and stephen###hill , and also had two interceptions . it was smith 's first 300 yard passing###game of his young career . i do n't want to make it seem like it 's nothing , smith said , but my mind is focused on turnovers . manuel , who led the bills to a comeback win last weekend against carolina , could n't do the same against the jets . he was 19 of 42 for 243 yards and the score , but was sacked eight times . i have to get the ball out of there , unless i want to get hit , manuel said . i needed to be able to get it out there so the receivers could make plays . 3 . marty magic under new offensive###coordinator marty###mornhinweg , the jets racked up 513 yards###of###total###offense the most during ryan 's tenure . it was also the first time new york had 500 or more yards###of###total###offense since . mornhinweg has clearly made a difference with a mostly unheralded unit and he did it in this game against mike###pettine , the bills' defensive###coordinator who spent 11 years as ryan 's right hand man . it was the first time the jets had a 300 yard passer ( smith , a 100 yard rusher ( bilal powell , 149 ) and a 100 yard receiver ( holmes , 154 , and hill , 108 ) since . they also had four pass plays of 40 yards or more , one shy of last year 's total . 4 . sacks in bunches buffalo came in having allowed just one sack in its first two games . new york nearly looked like the old sack exchange on sunday , taking manuel down eight times , including two sacks by muhammad wilkerson . it was the most sacks the jets had in a game since they sacked the giants' phil###simms eight times in . meanwhile , new york 's offensive###line did a terrific job of protecting smith , allowing no sacks . mario###williams , who had 4 last week , was held to two tackles for buffalo . 5 . banged up bills it was a costly defeat for buffalo , which lost cornerback leodis mckelvin to a hamstring injury and defensive###tackle marcell###dareus to an ankle###injury . defensive###end alex carrington was carted off late in the game with an apparent left knee###injury . running back c.j . spiller also left with a knee###injury and finished with just 9 yards###rushing . williams also might be ailing a bit . he got very little action late in the game , and marrone would only say that he saw the defensive###end getting work . the loss of mckelvin could be huge for a secondary that is already without safety jairus###byrd and cornerback stephon gilmore because of injuries . everybody 's going after our secondary , marrone said , and we just have to do a good job .
lake###buena###vista , fla . jameis###winston walked away with another major award thursday###night , the latest national prize to put on his mantle . he might want to save a spot for the heisman###trophy . the florida###state star headlined a big###night for the atlantic###coast###conference , winning the davey###o'brien###award as the country 's top quarterback at the annual college###football awards show at disney . winston also won the walter###camp player of the year award in a separate announcement . the redshirt###freshman , who led the top ranked seminoles to a 13 0 record and a berth in the bcs###national###championship###game against auburn next month , said he continues to be humbled by every accolade he 's received in recent weeks . it feels good . it 's an honor just to be here , winston said . i 'm just glad to bring them back to florida###state . winston hopes to become the fourth o'brien award###winner in a row to take home the heisman in the same year . he would join current nfl quarterbacks cam###newton ( 2010 ) and robert###griffin###iii , as well as texas a m 's johnny###manziel in . now that a sexual###assault complaint against him in tallahassee , fla . , has been closed without charges being filed , winston is the overwhelming###favorite to win college###football 's highest###honor saturday###night in new york . several players shared the hardware thursday , though . alabama quarterback aj###mccarron won the maxwell###award for player of the year , and pittsburgh defensive###tackle aaron###donald took home two big prizes the chuck###bednarik###award for defensive###player of the year and the outland###trophy as most outstanding interior###lineman . the acc led all conferences with four winners out of the nine awards that were presented two for donald , one for winston , and the doak###walker###award that went to andre###williams of boston###college as the nation 's best running back . williams joins winston , mccarron and manziel among the six heisman finalists . williams became the first doak###walker winner from his school and from the acc . he is also the sixth , 000 yard rusher to claim the honor . the eagles' senior actually missed graduation night thursday to be at the announcement . when he mentioned that on stage , he received an ovation from the audience . it 's great . it feels like i was being honored as an athlete and a student at the same time , he said . that 's supposed to be the mission , so it felt great . though he said this week that he believed he had a season deserving of his heisman nomination , mccarron , a fifth year senior with three national###championship rings at alabama , looked visibly taken aback when his name was called for the maxwell###award . super surprised , mccarron said . i do n't think i 'm the best player out of those other two guys that were mentioned . but i ca n't thank them enough . it 's an honor to be here . mccarron was sometimes overlooked despite leading alabama to an 11 1 season that left the crimson###tide just short of a chance to play for its third straight national###championship . he threw for , 676 yards and 26 touchdowns with five interceptions this season . now , he prepares to make his first trip to new york for the heisman ceremony , and mccarron said his game plan is simple . i 'm just going to enjoy the moment and live in the moment , he said . donald became the first defensive###lineman to win the bednarik###award since nebraska 's ndamukong###suh in . just to see all that hard work i put into football , it 's paying off today , donald said . it 's exciting to bring it back to the defensive side . but at the same time there 's a lot of talented offensive###linemen , so i 'm just honored to be able to take a turn . the two awards capped a big###week for donald , who also took home the bronko###nagurski award this week as the best defensive###player in the country , and the lombardi###award given annually to the nation 's top college lineman . other award###winners thursday were michigan###state senior cornerback darqueze dennard ( jim###thorpe###award for top defensive back , oregon###state junior receiver brandin cooks ( biletnikoff###award for best wide###receiver , and memphis senior tom hornsey ( ray###guy###award for top punter . winston was n't the only florida###state player to be honored . seminoles freshman roberto aguayo won the lou###groza###award as the nation 's best place###kicker . winston stood and applauded as aguayo walked up to accept the trophy . winston said no matter what happens at the heisman ceremony saturday , moments like that are what he is savoring most right now . that 's just how i am . i love my teammates , winston said . and i think they deserve that type of applause because they 've had an excellent season . and it 's not over yet .

hoofddorp , the netherlands major###league###baseball wants to play ball , exhibition###games or even regular###season###games , in europe . but the ballpark it is eyeing for possible games lies not in big sports centers , like london with its wembley###stadium , or paris , with the stade###de###france , but this midsize dutch town on land that until about 150 years###ago lay deep under water . baseball is gaining in popularity in the netherlands , but hoofddorp , with a population of about , 000 and just southwest of amsterdam , has found that bringing major###league ball there has all the charms of a three hour rain delay . hoofddorp is toiling on a 15 million project , including a modest ballpark , capable of temporary expansion to seat , 000 , and five diamonds for use by the local###team , the hoofddorp pioniers . when the fields are ready , sometime next spring , the pioniers will begin###playing there . but making the field acceptable for the big###leagues , the town has discovered , is a major###league headache . i 've got to listen to the club , what they want , said maarten broersen , the energetic project manager and an avid baseball fan . i 've got to listen to major###league###baseball , what they want , and i 've got to listen to my budget . sometimes i 've got to make a sacrifice , he said . take locker###rooms . major###league###baseball insisted on 400 square###meters , about , 300 square###feet , per team . for daily use , what 's the sense of that ? mr . broersen said , striding across the construction site , a hard###hat bobbing on his head . or showers i do n't need a shower###room with 10 or 12 shower heads , but m.l.b . said , 'i want it . ' so i 'll skip the automatic toilet flushing , he said , exasperation evident in his voice , to get the shower heads . such compromising has pushed the project ahead nicely , but not without bizarre decisions . major###league###baseball has sent some top consultants to assure that the ballpark meets its specifications . for the pitcher 's mound and batter 's circle , for instance , the league insisted on a special blend of clay , silt and gravel common in american ballparks ( fenway###park seems to have been the model , yet the mix could not be found in europe . so the dutch , not without some grumbling , flew in 200 tons of it from virginia , and consultants for major###league###baseball installed it . dutch customs officials at amsterdam###airport###schiphol , totally perplexed by a shipment of that much clay , accompanied the trucks to the building site , apparently to make sure nothing else was concealed###inside the neat plastic bundles . on the less contentious question of outfield turf , both sides accepted a local solution . the league wanted a kind of bluegrass , common in american ballparks . though the dutch are hardly amateur gardeners their companies handle the turf in major european soccer stadiums it was only after much searching that murray###cook , the official field consultant to major###league###baseball , accepted a local seed mix . we were using bluegrass type seeds , mr . cook , the president of sports turf services , said in a telephone interview . it 's a local turf type grass using dutch seeds . after all , they need to maintain it . mr . cook gave the dutch high marks for the design of the drainage system , crucial to any ballpark but especially for one where the field is almost 25 feet below sea###level . they sure know how to move water , he said . the idea to lure major###league###baseball to the netherlands was hatched about five years###ago when the pioniers were told they would have to leave their old playing###fields in a part of hoofddorp earmarked for residential development . together , the town and the team decided that new baseball fields be built to meet major###league specifications , with the aim of hosting exhibition###games or even regular###season###games . major###league###baseball officials were happy to sign on . they 've had a lot of success in recent###years promoting baseball , said paul archey , the league 's senior###vice###president for business operations , who visited hoofddorp in late august .
fort###worth , texas matt###kuchar was hoping he would be able to finish his second round friday###night at colonial . he ended up with the lead and a very early wakeup call . kuchar had only three holes to complete in what so far was a bogey free round , with his ball already on the 16th green . he was at 10 under and described the conditions as just perfect right now . but kuchar was among 54 players still on the course when play was suspended at hogan 's alley because of an impending storm system . the 18 groups that did n't###finish are scheduled to resume the second round at 15 a.m . ct saturday , just more than 12 hours after coming off the course . that 's a bit of a bummer , said kuchar , who opened with a 5 under . it 's no fun to wake up at 30 to get out here and play three holes . at least kuchar has the lead , by one stroke over graham###delaet , the canadian who shot a 67 in a morning round completed before a 2 hour , 10 minute###delay just after noon because of lightning . delaet was at 9 under . kuchar , no . 13 in the world and the highest###ranked###player in the field , took the lead with a 6 foot###birdie###putt at 457 yard 14th hole , and recovered from a drive into a fairway bunker on the 15th for a par while clouds darkened and thunder could be heard in the distance . soon after kuchar , the wgc accenture match###play winner in february , teed off at the par 3 16th , and his ball landed about 40 feet from the cup , the horn sounded ending play . it was raining heavily about 30 minutes later . first round leader ryan###palmer , the colonial member who had an opening , was still at 8 under after an up and down 12 holes friday that he managed to play at even par . steve###flesch , 19 year old jordan###spieth ( 67 ) from dallas and josh teater ( 67 ) finished at 8 under . flesch 's 64 matched the best completed round of the day and , more importantly , will end his string of 16 missed cuts on the pga###tour since october . the 2004 colonial champion missed the cut in all 12 of his pga###tour starts last year before right shoulder###surgery in august , and is playing only his third tour event this year . the 45 year old flesch is playing on a non exempt major medical extension and has to make , 510 between this weekend and his next three events to prolong that medical extension . i 'm very comfortable here and just glad to actually play on the weekend now , flesch said . i was actually cruising , then i got that rain delay and i kind of lost all of my rhythm . ... it 's like starting your whole round over . my swing did n't###feel very well on those last three ( holes . flesch was on the course trying to complete his morning round when play was stopped for the first time . he had just made a 33 foot###birdie###putt at the difficult par 4 fifth hole , his 14th hole of the day . the lefty finished with four pars in a row . palmer hit his opening###drive way right at no . 1 , a par 5 that is generally among colonial 's easiest holes , and started with a par . the former texas a m golfer with three pga###tour wins sank an 11 foot###birdie###putt at no . 3 , but hit his drive at no . 5 behind a tree and took a drop in the rough , leading a double###bogey . he followed with a bogey at no . 6 after driving into a fairway bunker . when you shoot 8 under , it 's hard to come back sometimes . ... i was calm all day , confident , palmer said . now i' even par sitting on 13th tee , i have soft greens and pretty calm winds in the morning , so maybe i can get up there with kuchar and we can have some fun tomorrow . in his last three holes before the suspension of play , palmer made an 8 foot birdied at no . 10 and rolled in a 27 footer at no . 12 . he never teed off at the par 3 13th . kuchar matched delaet for the lead after four birdies his first seven holes . kuchar had a 15 foot eagle chance at no . 1 that came up just short , then his approach at no . 2 stopped inside 3 feet after ricocheting out of the cup . the front nine , i really got it going , kuchar said . i jarred a shot on 2 that landed in the hole and came back out . ... i really got off to a great start . and then i kept playing some good golf . delaet was 10 under after his third consecutive birdie , a 6 footer at the 373 yard second hole that was his shortest putt in that stretch . then he arrived at colonial 's famed horrible horseshoe as the nos . 3 5 holes are known because of their layout and the difficulty of the stretch a 239 yard par 3 sandwiched by the two longest par 4s on the course . it definitely got me today , said delaet , who bogeyed all three holes . after delaet 's tee###shot at the 470 yard third hole went into a fairway bunker , the canadian badly missed the green at the par 3 before his approach###shot at the 475 yard fifth hole came up short of the green . but delaet finished strong , with consecutive birdies to finish after he had come up just short of a 31 foot birdie at no . 7 . always nice , and kind of got myself right back in it , said delaet , whose has never finished better than third on the pga###tour in 69 events . the main thing for me , i

zurich usain###bolt is not worried about tarnishing his career by failing to retain his 100 and 200 meters olympic titles in rio de janeiro in three years' time . in life you do n't always get what you want , the jamaican told###reuters television after visiting fifa president sepp###blatter at the headquarters of soccer 's world governing###body . it would n't be the greatest###moment , but i would understand because i 've had my time , i 've been dominant for a long time . so , if i get to rio and it does n't###happen , i would have to understand because i 'm getting older and there are greater athletes coming up , added bolt who turned 27 a week ago . i know the athletes have to work harder to step their game up , and be the best . for me , i 'll be happy for the sport because it would mean its stepping up and moving on . earlier , bolt , who will compete in the zurich diamond###league meeting on thursday , was handed a ticket for the 2014 world###cup final by blatter along with a furry toy depicting the tournament mascot , a grinning blue and yellow armadillo named fuleco . to go to rio and win again would be a feat in itself , because it would be the first time anybody has ever won three times in a row so that would also add to my greatness , he said . as an athlete you are always pushing the limit and for me i want to continue pushing the barrier , added bolt , who won the 100 and 200 meters double at the 2008 and 2012 olympics and will be approaching his 30th birthday in rio in . at the end of the day i want to be remembered among the greatest###athletes , pele , ( diego ) maradona , michael###johnson . bolt also commented on a suggestion that he could take up a sports administration role after retiring as an athlete , but said he might be too lazy for the role . i have thought about it , i have to admit i 'm slightly lazy , but we 'll see where it goes , he said .
rio de janeiro police###fired###tear###gas and rubber###bullets to disperse the crowds as protests marred a second successive day of the confederations###cup soccer tournament in brazil on sunday . protesters tried to pass a police blockade outside rio de janeiro 's maracana stadium where mexico were playing italy in the tournament , a run through event for next year 's world###cup###finals . reuters tv filmed police firing tear###gas and rubber###bullets at the crowd estimated by local###media at around 600 people . they were to trying to negotiate with the protesters to retreat , i am a protester , one man told###reuters tv . but they did n't###wait , they came this way , they encircled us and fired###tear###gas into the crowds without seeing if there were women or children . the protests are ostensibly against the costs of this tournament and the world###cup but people are also angry in rio about a local issue surrounding the cost of public###transport . there were demonstrations around the country last week against public###transport costs . protests marred the opening day of the tournament on saturday when around 500 protesters were tear gassed by police in brasilia where the hosts were playing japan .
paris david###ferrer did not look overwhelmed by the occasion in his first grand###slam###singles###final , only overwhelmed by the opponent . nadal , always nadal , ferrer said before sunday 's match . so it must seem at the french###open , the world 's most prestigious claycourt tournament . rafael###nadal already had set a men 's record last year by winning his seventh singles title at roland garros . on sunday , he created even more space between himself and bjorn borg , the great swedish champion , by winning his eighth . he also became the first man in history to win eight singles titles at the same grand###slam###tournament . nadal did all that by gathering strength on a dreary , drizzly afternoon in paris and beating ferrer , his 31 year old friend and spanish compatriot , 6 3 , 6 2 , 6 3 . in terms of the forehands and backhands , it was one of the more straightforward of nadal 's eight finals in paris . the only time he looked genuinely rattled was when he dropped his serve late in the second set after a bare###chested protester wearing a white mask and carrying a flare managed to leap a barrier and get onto the court . but the path to this suspense free sunday had more than its customary share of uncertainty . there were the knee problems that kept nadal off tour for seven months until february . and there was the brilliance and ambition of novak###djokovic , the world 's no . 1 player , who beat nadal on clay in monte###carlo in april and came within a few points of knocking him out of this tournament in the semifinals on friday . it 's clear this year means something very special to me , nadal said . five months###ago nobody in my team dreamed of a comeback like this , because we thought it would be impossible . but here we are today , and that 's really fantastic and incredible . sunday 's match with ferrer was indeed an anticlimax after the emotional and tactical heights scaled in that semifinal in which nadal had to rally to win , 9 7 , in the fifth . a lesser champion might have suffered a letdown , but nadal a world###class worrier who has yet to strike an overconfident note in his career kept his eye on the usual prize and kept delivering lengthy , even impassioned , rebuttals to anyone who had the temerity to suggest that ferrer might not pose much of a threat . if i do n't###play perfect , i 'm going to have a big###chance to lose , nadal said before the match . it 's impossible to arrive in the final of roland garros without losing a set if your game is not at a very high###level . it was true that ferrer , seeded no . 4 , had not lost a set on his way to the final , but despite all his hustle and exquisite timing close to the baseline , he could not come close to winning a set against nadal , who has dominated their head to head rivalry , winning 20 of their 24 matches . there is no indignity in that , of course . nadal is also the only member of the so called big four to have a head to head edge over all the other members of that club djokovic , roger###federer and andy###murray . in his era , he 's dominating the very best competition , said jim###courier , the two time french###open champion . it 's going to take something really marvelous for any of those players to get back on even terms . with 12 grand###slam###singles###titles , nadal is now tied for third on the career list with roy###emerson behind federer 's 17 and pete###sampras 's . nadal , 27 , has more years of potential excellence ahead and solving the riddle of his game on red clay whether rain###soaked or sunbaked remains one of the great conundrums in modern###sport . his record at roland garros is 59 1 with the only loss coming in the fourth###round in 2009 against robin soderling . that is the kind of big###moment dominance that the jamaican###sprinter usain###bolt , a six time olympic###gold###medalist , could certainly relate to as he watched from the front row on the philippe chatrier court . this is my first time seeing tennis live , bolt said . for me , it 's outstanding to see a champion like that . as bolt handed over the trophy , much of the crowd watched under the cover of umbrellas and ponchos . it was a full wardrobe french###open with the necessary gear ranging from winter jackets to linen shirts from watchman 's caps to panama hats . i do n't like to play in these conditions , probably my opponent neither , nadal said .

new york curtis###granderson is heading across town , where the new york mets hope his home###run swing wo n't###suffer at citi###field . the free###agent outfielder agreed to a 60 million , four year contract with the mets , according to a person familiar with the situation . the person spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity friday because the deal was pending a physical and no announcement had been made . granderson , who turns 33 in march , comes over from the crosstown yankees and gives the mets much needed power in their punchless outfield . he batted . 229 with seven homers and 15 rbis this year , when wrist and hand###injuries limited him to 61 games . but he surpassed 40 homers in each of his previous two seasons in pinstripes . the move marks general###manager sandy###alderson 's most expensive free###agent signing by far after three years of bargain shopping as the mets rebuilt . a three time all star , granderson provides proven thump from the left side of the plate to complement right handed hitter david###wright in a lineup that managed only 130 home###runs last season tied for 25th among 30 major###league teams . new york also signed###free###agent outfielder chris###young to a . 25 million , one year contract this offseason . granderson has played###center###field most of his career but spent time in both left and right last season . he figures to fill a corner spot with the mets , who plan to use defensive whiz juan lagares or young in center . new york 's outfield combined to hit . 238 this year ( 29th in the majors ) with 50 homers ( tied for 24th ) and 209 rbis ( 16th , according to stats . the group also includes speedy left###fielder eric###young jr . , the nl stolen###base leader . granderson turned down a.1 million qualifying###offer from the yankees to test the open###market . the mets , however , would not have to forfeit their first###round###draft###pick to sign him because they own the 10th overall selection . the top 10 picks are protected . granderson hit 41 home###runs in , when he led the american###league in runs ( 136 ) and rbis ( 119 ) and finished###fourth in mvp voting . he had 43 homers and 106 rbis in , taking advantage of the short right field porch at yankee###stadium . the mets hope his power will translate to spacious citi###field , where it 's more difficult to clear the fences . granderson 's numbers have declined the past two years , down to a . 317 on###base###percentage and . 407 slugging mark last season . he also is prone to strikeouts whiffing 364 times from 2011 2012 and joins a mets lineup that fanned , 384 times this year , tied with atlanta for most in the nl . but his bat is a significant upgrade for the mets , starved for offense following their fifth straight losing###season since moving into citi###field . now , the club can focus on other areas of need shortstop , first base , the pitching staff heading into baseball 's winter###meetings next week . granderson was on the disabled###list twice last season after getting hit by pitches . he missed the first 38 games after breaking his right wrist when he was plunked by toronto left hander j.a . happ in his first spring###training plate###appearance on feb . 24 . not long after he returned , granderson broke a knuckle on his left pinkie when he was hit at tampa###bay on may . that kept him out until august , making granderson one of several yankees stars to be sidelined much of the season . new york was unable to overcome all the injuries , missing the playoffs for only the second time in 19 years . granderson 's agreement with the mets was first reported by the new york post .
berlin###germany have kept things in the family and will set up their brazil 2014 world###cup base at a german built resort under construction in porto###seguro , north of rio de janeiro , the country 's football###association said on friday . germany , bidding for their fourth###world cup###title and their first international###trophy since , are eager to have ideal preparations in the run up and during the month long tournament starting in june . we saw at the previous world###cup in 2010 that short###distances between team headquarters , training###pitches and media centre are crucial for everyone involved , team manager oliver###bierhoff said . the campo bahia as their headquarters will be known consists of 65 rooms still under construction with a what the dfb said was a village atmosphere and well away from the crowded metropolitan###areas of sao paolo and rio . it is to be completed by march next year . the location is also 45 minutes from the port seguro airport which germany will use for their group matches to cities within two hours' flight as they are keen to avoid long trips across the vast country . it was important for us to minimise any travel fatigue because of the size of the country and the great###distances between cities , bierhoff said . the germans have been drawn against ghana , the united###states and portugal in group g . they face portugal in salvador on june 16 before traveling to fortaleza to face ghana on june 21 and finishing off in recife against the united###states five days later . they will kick off their pre###tournament preparations with a camp in italy on may 21 before playing two friendlies against yet undetermined teams on june 1 and on june 6 before departing for brazil on june . german also have scheduled friendlies on march 5 against chile and on may 13 against poland .
paris right now , french###open champions rafael###nadal and serena###williams are as good as it gets in tennis . the next time we see them competing , though , at wimbledon in two weeks , nadal will be merely a serious contender , while williams will be the unquestioned favorite . both are 43 2 in . he 's won 22 matches in a row . her winning###streak is at , the longest###single season run on the women 's tour in 13 years . nadal 's grand###slam###title total now stands at , tied with roy###emerson for the third most in the history of the men 's game , behind only roger###federer 's 17 and pete###sampras' . williams is up to 16 major singles trophies , sixth best among women , with chris###evert and martina###navratilova right above her on the list at . now comes the shift from the clay of roland garros to the grass of wimbledon , and that is where the similarities end . williams is a five time champion at the all england club , including a year ago , and the way she 's playing at the moment , there is little reason to anticipate anyone beating her there this time . nadal , despite his recent form , is only one of a group of men who can think of themselves as possible champions , along with no . 1 ranked novak###djokovic , no . 2 andy murrray and no . 3 federer . the objective now is to celebrate tonight , toni nadal , rafael 's uncle and coach , said sunday , when his nephew won his eighth french open###championship by easily###beating david###ferrer , 6 2 , 6 3 in the final , two days after outlasting djokovic 9 7 in the fifth set of a wonderful semifinal , and then we will see if he plays well at wimbledon . even the nadals acknowledge that rafa , as many call him , is not quite as superb on grass as he is on clay . how could he be ? he is 59 1 in the french###open , with four titles in a row from 2005 08 and another four in a row from , and the only man to claim eight titles at the same major tournament . that said , he 's done well at wimbledon , winning it in 2008 and , and losing in the final to federer in 2006 07 and to djokovic in . a year ago , though , nadal exited in the second round against lukas rosol , who was ranked 100th at the time . that would be the last match nadal played for about seven months because of a painful left knee , an absence that saw him skip the london olympics , the u.s . open and the australian###open and is the reason he 's ranked no . 5 this week , not higher . some weeks i did n't###feel well , but the last couple of weeks i start to feel ... better , nadal said sunday . i am still going week by week , day by day . he usually likes to prepare for wimbledon by playing in another grass###court tournament during the week right after the french###open . but this time , nadal chose not to , withdrawing from the field in halle , germany , and opting for rest , instead . that 's not the ideal###situation before a grand###slam like wimbledon that is on grass , nadal said . the conditions are very different . what he will do is head to the practice court , to keep on getting better , just as he 's done for years . his serve used to be a real weakness , for example , so nadal and uncle toni studied ways to speed it up and add variety . at first , he found grass to be problematic , but his accomplishments at wimbledon are ample proof that he figured out a way to overcome that , too . you can improve always , in every way , nadal said . and in tennis , for sure , you can keep improving . williams expressed a similar sentiment after her , 6 4 victory over defending###champion maria###sharapova in the women 's final saturday in paris . unlike nadal , she 's had her issues with red clay after winning the french###open in , it took williams 11 years to get her hands on a second trophy . and unlike nadal , she 's excelled more on other surfaces , with those five wimbledon championships , plus five on hard###courts at the australian###open , and four on hard###courts at the u.s . open . tough as her serve was to handle at the french###open these last two weeks she hit 10 aces against sharapova , for example , including three in the last game it should only be more effective on grass , where balls skid instead of clay 's higher bounces . after her own stunning early exit at a grand###slam###tournament last year at roland garros , in the first round , to a woman ranked 111th williams immediately went about fixing things . she stuck around paris to practice for wimbledon at coach patrick mouratoglou 's tennis academy and has gone 74 3 since , winning three of the last four major titles , plus gold at the olympics . it really was a shock for her . she really worked on rebuilding herself to become perhaps stronger than ever , mouratoglou said . and williams insists that she is willing to find new areas to work on , which might not be comforting to other women hoping to knock her from no . 1 . the day i feel that i cannot improve , it 's going to be a problem for me . i 'm going to have to really debate whether i should keep playing , said williams , who almost always skips wimbledon tuneup tournaments . but i feel like , as of now , i can do a lot of things better . i can be better . i feel like i can be more fit . there 's still a###level of improvement that i can reach . it 's hard to top being unbeatable , which is what she and nadal have been lately . howard fendrich covers tennis for the associated press . write to him at hfendrich ( at ) ap . org
council###bluffs , iowa the biggest donors in the republican###party are financing a new group to recruit seasoned candidates and protect senate incumbents from challenges by far right conservatives and tea###party enthusiasts who republican leaders worry could complicate the party 's efforts to win control of the senate . the group , the conservative victory project , is intended to counter other organizations that have helped###defeat establishment republican###candidates over the last two election cycles . it is the most robust attempt yet by republicans to impose a new sense of discipline on the party , particularly in primary races . there is a broad concern about having blown a significant number of races because the wrong candidates were selected , said steven j . law , the president of american###crossroads , the super###pac creating the new project . we do n't view ourselves as being in the incumbent protection business , but we want to pick the most conservative###candidate who can win . the effort would put a new twist on the republican vs . republican warfare that has consumed the party 's primary races in recent###years . in effect , the establishment is taking###steps to fight back against tea###party groups and other conservative organizations that have wielded significant###influence in backing candidates who ultimately###lost seats to democrats in the general###election . the first test of the group 's effort to influence primary races could come here in iowa , where some republicans are already worrying about who will run for the seat being vacated by senator tom###harkin , a democrat . it is the first open senate###seat in iowa since , and republicans are fearful of squandering a rare opportunity . the conservative victory project , which is backed by karl###rove and his allies who built american###crossroads into the largest republican super###pac of the 2012 election cycle , will start by intensely vetting prospective contenders for congressional races to try to weed out candidates who are seen as too flawed to win general elections . the project is being waged with last year 's senate contests in mind , particularly the one in missouri , where representative todd###akin 's comment that legitimate rape rarely causes pregnancy rippled through races across the country . in indiana , the republican###candidate , richard e . mourdock , lost a race after he said that when a woman became pregnant during a rape it was something god intended . as republicans rebuild from losing the white###house race and seats in the house and senate last year , party###leaders and strategists are placing a heightened focus on taking###control of the senate next year . republicans must pick up six seats to win a majority . representative steve###king , a six term iowa republican , could be among the earliest targets of the conservative victory project . he said he had not decided whether he would run for the senate , but the leaders of the project in washington are not waiting to try to steer him away from the race . the group 's plans , which were outlined for the first time last week in an interview with mr . law , call for hard###edge campaign tactics , including television advertising , against candidates whom party###leaders see as unelectable and a drag###on the efforts to win the senate . mr . law cited iowa as an example and said republicans could no longer be squeamish about intervening in primary fights . we 're concerned about steve###king 's todd###akin problem , mr . law said . this is an example of candidate discipline and how it would play in a general###election . all of the things he 's said are going to be hung around his neck . mr . king has compiled a record of incendiary statements during his time in congress , including comparing illegal###immigrants to dogs and likening capitol###hill maintenance###workers to stasi troops after they were ordered to install environmentally###friendly light###bulbs . but he rejected the suggestion that his voting###record or previous remarks would keep him from winning if he decided to run for the senate . this is a decision for iowans to make and should not be guided by some political staffers in washington , mr . king said in an interview , pointing out that he won his congressional race last year even though president###obama easily###defeated mitt###romney in iowa . the last election , they said i could n't###win that , either , and the entire machine was against me .
pittsford , n.y . quarterback kevin###kolb 's chances of earning the buffalo###bills starting###job were nearly upended by a wet and slippery rubber mat . kolb , who is locked in a competition with rookie first round###pick ej###manuel , avoided serious injury to his left knee when he slipped and stumbled awkwardly while switching fields between practice drills saturday . coach doug###marrone said the injury does not appear to be serious . he called it a bump , and listed kolb day by day . marrone also provided an update on the status of stevie###johnson , saying the team 's no . 1 receiver will miss at least a week with a pulled left hamstring . johnson was hurt in practice friday . kolb was n't available for comment , but showed frustration by angrily tossing his helmet to the ground before being examined by head trainer bud carpenter . after a few minutes , kolb got up got up on his own and was escorted to the locker###room . kolb was joining the quarterbacks and receivers in making their way through a tunnel to work out on an adjoining field . he slipped on a mat laid down over the concrete , and immediately###began hobbling in pain . kolb then put his arm around carpenter 's shoulder for support . it was a freak###accident that happened about 50 minutes into practice at bills training###camp in suburban rochester . when wet , the mats provide very little traction , especially for players wearing cleats . shortly after kolb slipped , several camp volunteers arrived with brooms to sweep away any remaining water from the mats . manuel took the extra precaution the next time he went through the tunnel by walking mostly on the concrete . this is but the latest in a series of setbacks for kolb , who is entering his seventh nfl season and seeking a fresh###start in buffalo after signing a two year contract in april . selected by philadelphia in the second round of the 2007 draft , kolb was sidelined by a concussion in losing the eagles' starting###job to michael###vick to open the 2009 season . kolb then spent the past two seasons in arizona , where he failed to secure the starting###job because of an assortment of injuries . marrone said it 's unfair to label kolb injury###prone . the one thing i do know about kevin is that he is a tough son of a gun , marrone said . he 'll get back out there quickly if it 's up to him . in the meantime , manuel will be getting more practice time with the starters . that 's a significant step up after kolb spent much of the first week of camp getting most of the work with the starters . marrone had been increasing manuel 's responsibilities over the past week , with the two quarterbacks nearly evenly splitting snaps by friday . marrone liked how manuel responded after kolb was hurt by not letting the injury affect him or the offense . it was a very smooth###transition , marrone said . it can affect the team . and i did n't see it affect the two guys behind him , so that 's positive . it 's too early to determine whether kolb 's injury will affect the quarterback rotation for the bills preseason###opener at indianapolis on aug . 11 . manuel has shown improvement with each day of practice . on saturday , he hit marcus easley on a deep route , and also showed off his speed in taking off on quarterback sweeps . manuel was selected 16th overall out of florida###state , and the only quarterback taken in the first round of the draft . the bills have only one other quarterback at camp , jeff tuel , an###undrafted###rookie###free###agent out of washington###state . as for stevie###johnson , the receiver was disappointed to be sidelined once again by injury . he missed most of the team 's spring practices with a sore back . he 's also had a history of groin problems that have cropped up during camp . johnson said he felt something pop just as he was pushing off his left###leg to make a cut . he expects to be ready for the start of the season . the season 's where the money 's made , man , johnson said . i 'll be out there to play . notes with wr kevin elliott ( right shoulder ) also out , the bills signed undrafted###rookie wr terrell sinkfield on saturday . the northern###iowa product has already been cut twice this offseason , by miami and green###bay . ... reserve te mike caussin , who hurt his hip friday , will have the injury evaluated next week to determine how much time he 'll miss , marrone said . ... de mario###williams took part in on field individual drills for the first time since complaining of a sore foot before the first training###camp practice .
the federal###aviation###administration said on friday that it would order inspections of the wiring in emergency transmitters on boeing 787s as it continues to narrow the search for what caused a fire on one of the jets last week at london 's heathrow###airport . safety investigators are examining whether a pinched wire on a harness connecting a battery to the transmitter caused or helped###spread the fire . they also want to check the transmitters' battery for signs of unusual heating or moisture . while the agency prepares the order over the next few days , boeing plans to instruct all 13 airlines that use the dreamliner to either inspect or remove the transmitters , which send out a plane 's location after a crash . the f.a.a . 's plans to order only an inspection fall short of a recommendation on thursday by british investigators , who called on the f.a.a . to order airlines to disable the batteries . it also might place the f.a.a . in conflict with other regulators . air###transport###world , a trade publication , on friday quoted a spokesman for the european###aviation###safety###agency as saying that it was drafting instructions to european airlines to remove the transmitters . the british air###accidents###investigation###branch also called on thursday for a broader safety review of similar###devices in thousands of other jets . but the f.a.a . will take more time to review the recommendation . reuters reported on friday that japanese authorities planned to temporarily waive rules that require its airlines to have transmitters on their planes . that action would allow all nippon airways and japan###airlines , which fly more than 40 percent of the 68 dreamliners delivered so far , to remove the devices if they saw fit . boeing and regulators from the united###states , europe and japan have been trying to devise a solution that would work even if various countries differ on whether the devices should be removed or merely inspected . the british investigators made their recommendations after finding signs of disruption in the battery cells of an emergency transmitter on an ethiopian###airlines 787 that caught fire while parked at heathrow###airport . the british said the investigation was still in its early###stages , and the cause had not been established . british investigators called for quick###action to address the problem because most passenger jets do not have fire suppressant systems near the transmitters , which are attached to the top of the plane just in front of the tail . that area received the most damage from the fire on the ethiopian###airlines , which had been parked at heathrow for 10 hours . if such a fire occurred in flight , the british investigators said on thursday , it could pose a significant safety concern and raise challenges for the cabin###crew . the dreamliner , which makes extensive use of lightweight composite###materials and cuts fuel costs by 20 percent , is crucial to boeing 's future . united###states officials have said that the lack of proof about the cause of the fire and the fact that none of the transmitters had been known to cause a fire in more than 50 million flight###hours suggested that simply inspecting , rather than removing , the devices should be sufficient . in its report on thursday , britain 's air###accidents###investigation###branch said that about , 000 of the transmitters had been produced by honeywell###aerospace since . the transmitters are used in a wide range of aircraft , including airbus planes . honeywell and other manufacturers also make similar###devices for thousands of other commercial and business jets . aviation experts said the devices have been particularly helpful in locating the wreckage of smaller###private and corporate planes . the global###positioning and communications###systems on the 787 and other large jets are so sophisticated that they constantly relay the planes' locations to computers on the ground , making the devices less critical . given the possibility of malfunction , boeing and honeywell have each said it would be prudent for airlines to temporarily remove the devices from 787s while the investigation into the cause of the fire continues . in looking for signs of unusual heating or moisture in the transmitter 's battery , investigators are also considering whether distinctive###characteristics of the 787 could have played a role . the 787 's cabin maintains a higher humidity level than other jets to increase passenger###comfort . one theory is that the humidity could have created condensation that caused a short###circuit in the battery or its wiring . another concern is that the composite skin absorbs more heat from the sun than the aluminum on other planes . that has prompted questions about whether the battery in the transmitter could have been degraded by excessive###heat from the skin . but battery experts said that barring a flaw in the battery 's construction , the transmitter is sealed so tightly that neither moisture nor heat was likely to cause a short###circuit . i ca n't really subscribe to either one of those , said ralph j . brodd , a battery consultant in henderson , nev .
washington the pastor whom president###obama has chosen to deliver the benediction at his inauguration this month delivered a sermon in the 1990s in which he called on fellow christians to fight the aggressive agenda of the gay###rights###movement and advocated the healing power of jesus as the only way out of a homosexual lifestyle . think progress , a liberal blog affiliated with the center###for###american###progress action fund , reported wednesday###afternoon on the sermon delivered by the rev . louie###giglio , an atlanta minister and founder of the passion conferences , a group dedicated to uniting college students in worship and prayer . the speech , in search of a standard christian response to homosexuality , can be heard on discipleship library , a christian training web###site . in it , mr . giglio cites scripture in saying that homosexuality is sin in the eyes of god , and it is sin in the word of god . he warned against gay###rights . that movement is not a benevolent movement , he said . it is a movement to seize by any means necessary the feeling and the mood of the day , to the point where the homosexual lifestyle becomes accepted as a norm in our society . inaugural officials did not respond to a request for comment , and a spokeswoman for mr . giglio was not available . wayne besen , founder of truth wins out , which fights antigay sentiment , said it is imperative that giglio clarify his remarks and explain whether he has evolved on gay###rights , like so many other faith and political###leaders . it would be a shame to select a preacher with backward views on l.g.b.t . people at a moment when the nation is rapidly###moving forward on our issues . the controversy over mr . giglio carries echoes of the 2009 inaugural , when mr . obama offended many gay people by selecting the rev . rick###warren , author of a purpose driven life and an opponent of same###sex###marriage , to deliver the invocation . gay###rights advocates have not forgotten . you 'd think that once burned , the obama inaugural team would be twice shy about picking an antigay bigot for the swearing###in###ceremony , john aravosis wrote on americablog , which covers gay and lesbian issues . well , meet rick###warren lite , pastor louie###giglio . but the president also pleased his gay constituency on wednesday , when his committee announced that it had selected richard###blanco , an openly###gay writer of cuban###descent , to be the 2013 inaugural poet .
boston five things learned in the chicago###blackhawks' 6 5 overtime win over the boston###bruins in game 4 of the stanley###cup###finals wednesday###night blackhawks bounce back the blackhawks had plenty to celebrate after splitting two games in boston . chicago hosts game 5 on saturday with the series tied at two apiece instead of in a 3 1 hole . the blackhawks also atoned for their listless performance in a 2 0 loss in game 3 on monday . chicago had six shots on goalie tuukka###rask before the bruins had any . the blackhawks also came out hitting and never let up , showing some grit that was lacking in the previous###game . while the bruins rallied to tie it three different times , the blackhawks never trailed . they keep coming . they 're a hard working team . they have skill on all their lines , chicago coach joel quennville said . they have a mobile and active d . they have big###shots . defensively you 're always going to get challenged and tested . but i thought we did a better job of our offense putting some pressure on their d . ot again maybe the 48 game lockout###shortened schedule was a good thing , because the postseason is getting stretched to the max . wednesday 's game was the 27th overtime###game of this year 's playoffs , one short of the record set in . that was also the last time three games in the finals went beyond regulation , with montreal taking all three while beating wayne###gretzky and the los###angeles###kings . it 's exciting . everybody worked so hard tonight . everybody 's worked so hard through the playoffs , said brent###seabrook , who scored on a slap###shot 51 into ot . we 're all contributing . it does n't matter if i score or anybody else scores , it 's nice to get the win and move on to the next day . the blackhawks are 5 2 in ot during the playoffs and the bruins are , losing for the first time in an ot game in boston in these playoffs . rask roughed boston goalie tuukka###rask 's remarkable postseason run stalled on wednesday###night and his shutout###streak of more than 129 minutes was long###forgotten by the time it was over . rask had allowed seven goals over the previous seven games before the blackhawks cracked him in the largest offensive outburst of the series . chicago had just five goals in the series entering game , and the teams had combined for just 12 before striking for 11 on wednesday . the final one came on seabrook 's slap###shot as captain jonathan###toews provided a bulky screen in front of rask as the puck got past him and tucked inside the far post . we were just around the net . we were getting inside and found the rebounds , said toews , who had gone 10 games without a goal before he scored early in the second to put chicago up . ugly goals , we do n't care . we 'll find a way . it 's something we need to keep doing . boston coach claude julien did not blame rask for the loss in his postgame comments , but did n't exactly rush to his goalie 's defense , either . i do n't evaluate the players publicly here , julien said . i look at our whole team and tell you our whole team was average . you can take what you want from that . i think we can be a lot better . we have an opportunity to be better next game . hopefully , if anything , that makes us even hungrier . no glove the bruins made it a long night for chicago goalie corey###crawford as well , finding a vulnerable spot on his glove side and targeting it all game . all five of boston 's goals were to crawford 's glove side and the bruins tested him there one final time in ot on a snap###shot by rich###peverley . crawford juggled the puck slightly , but held on to it and forced a faceoff . seabrook scored 19 seconds later and crawford had another win in the finals despite allowing five goals . corey has been great for us all year , all playoffs . he just moves###forward , coach joel###quenneville said . commend him . we got the win . you know , he 'll be fine . special teams the bruins scored a pair of power play goals , the blackhawks scored once while a man###up and another down a man as special teams finally were a factor . the blackhawks were scoreless in 11 power plays through the first three games and mired in a 0 for 29 drought before patrick###sharp scored to put chicago up 5 4 with 41 left in regulation . the goal came just after a 5 on 3 advantage for chicago expired , but before boston 's jaromir###jagr could get from the penalty###box into the play . the bruins had killed 27 straight penalties entering the game .
landover , md . antonio smith jr . works a merchandise stand at fedex###field during washington###redskins games , so he does not get to watch robert###griffin###iii play every week . but he has a pretty good feel for how griffin 's season is going . ooh , a lot of people are backing off from rg3 right now , a whole lot of people , smith said before sunday 's game against the giants . he said sales of griffin 's 100 jersey had fallen by half in recent weeks , and he described how several young###fans on sunday came up to him with their parents and asked for a griffin jersey , only to have mom or dad steer them to another choice . nah , you do n't want that guy 's jersey , he said , quoting a typical exchange . he 's not playing too well , and who knows if he 'll play well again ? how times have changed . last december , griffin was leading the redskins to a seven game winning###streak as they headed toward their first division title in 13 years and his no . 10 was flying off the shelves . a starter in his first game in the n.f.l. , griffin made the pro###bowl as a rookie . as he piled up wins , he came to be seen as a saint who could deliver the redskins and their fans from years of suffering . and he did , until a serious knee###injury ended his season just as the redskins tumbled out of the playoffs in the wild###card round . less than a year later , griffin is at a career crossroads . he showed last season that he could be a winning quarterback , one of the league 's best . this year , he is trying to show everyone that he has what it takes to be something more a player who can maintain his composure as his pocket regularly collapses , a leader who can keep his team from crumbling as the losses mount . that is a difficult###task for any quarterback , but even more so for a second year player who is still only . sunday 's game did not help his cause . the redskins lost to the giants , 24 17 , dropping their fourth###game in a row . at , they have been eliminated from the playoffs for the 17th time in 21 years . some of the fans streaming out of the stadium after sunday 's game probably blamed griffin for not doing more . others admitted that they just felt sorry for him . he should be seeing a sports psychologist or going through some kind of leadership training , said michael h . robinson , a season ticketholder and former high###school basketball coach . another fan , angela santini , said it was so obvious griffin is still hurting and scared after tearing the anterior###cruciate###ligament in his right knee late in his rookie###season . the injury , with his knee bending at unnatural angles , and its aftermath became a story###line in washington when the redskins continued to play him when he was clearly hobbled . santini is not the only one who thinks griffin returned from his knee surgery too quickly . the surgery usually requires a year of rehabilitation to get back up to speed griffin was back as a starter in about eight months . ahmad brooks , the san###francisco 49ers linebacker who sacked griffin twice last week , told csn washington that griffin should not be playing and that everybody can see it . everybody but griffin and the redskins , that is . they all say griffin 's knee is just fine . he has started every game this season . a quick examination of griffin 's face after sunday 's game did not reveal any distress . stone faced , he slapped his teammates' hands on the sideline as the giants celebrated . he walked to midfield to shake###hands with some of the opposing###players , including justin###tuck , the 6 foot , 268 pound defensive###end who had sacked him four times in the second half . the night had started well . griffin completed his first 12 passes and was 16 of 17 for 149 yards , with one touchdown , in the first half . he and the redskins looked unstoppable for a change , before his linemen 's blocks and his receivers' hands let him down repeatedly . griffin finished the game as the redskins' leading###rusher , with 88 yards , and he could have stood at his locker and blamed a lot of people not named rg3 for the loss . but he did not . instead , he has consistently preached that accountability for the redskins' terrible record is a teamwide responsibility . you can look at that in two ways . it could be his way of deflecting blame , or a strategy to keep the team together . or a brilliant mix of both . as i spoke with him alone at his locker after sunday 's game , he admitted that he felt an immense###pressure to win . he actually smiled , though , when he explained how tuck told him after the game , what you 're going through , not everybody has to go through , and i 'm proud of how you 're handling it . that 's big when you get that from other guys , even a guy in your division who 's a rival , he said . redskins cornerback deangelo###hall has stood back and watched griffin say those things and more this season . he said he had sensed a change in him . after the knee###injury , hall said , griffin seemed to realize finally that football was a business , and that people might not care about you as much as you thought . what amazes hall the most , though , is that griffin keeps grinning through it all . hall said that when he was a young###player , he would have probably fired off a couple of times already in the face of so much criticism . you never hear a bad word out of his mouth , hall said . if there 's anybody i 'd want my son to learn from , it 's him . the discipline could be a result of his upbringing in a military family or a sign that he has the drive and the desire to lead the redskins out of their current state . but to remain an attractive role###model , griffin must find a way to make the redskins win . that will be the best way to silence the critics , and to get those no . 10 jerseys flying off the shelves again .
the stanley###cup is back in the city of big shoulders and short memories , delivered by a chicago team that featured neither . the blackhawks started the lockout###shortened nhl season so fast , they were the team to beat for months . but they still could n't outmuscle anybody . they were all about speed and skill , advantages that get squeezed tighter , round by round , in the defensive vise of the postseason . they had to find another way to play with 30 left monday###night in boston , when goalie corey###crawford headed for the bench to bring on another attacker . turns out the blackhawks do desperation well , too . that 's kind of the way you had to score this whole series , coach joel###quenneville said after bryan bickell and dave###bolland banged in a pair of gritty goals during a 17 second span to stun the bruins . yet even after bolland 's putback of a rebound off the goal post , no less slipped by sprawling bruins goalie tuukka###rask , there were still 59 seconds###left on the clock . an eternity , patrick###kane , who won the conn###smythe###trophy as playoff###mvp , called it . things were happening so fast , recalled winger patrick###sharp , i looked up at the clock and knew it was going to be the longest minute of the season . better a minute like that one than all the minutes blackhawks fans ignored just five short years###ago . it was n't that long , after all , that the current toast of the town was just toast . toews , 25 , and kane , 24 , came along in 2006 and , when the blackhawks were already beginning their bounce back from the bottom . just a few years before that , the blackhawks were roundly derided as the worst franchise in pro sports . at , sharp is one of the longest###serving veterans of the team 's core . he 's made it a point not to let anybody in the locker###room forget that . after chicago 's 3 1 victory in game , sharp sat at his cubicle exhausted and stories rolled out about the bad old days . we 'd get , maybe , 000 fans , and in our building that felt like empty . i could pick friends of mine out in the crowd . some nights , they 'd have their own section , he laughed . we used to have business cards with a website address and we 'd tell people , 'go there and you 'd get two free###tickets . ' people would n't even take the cards ! the 2004 05 lockout hurt hockey , but the rule changes that opened up the game helped the hawks . then general###manager dale###tallon finally quit pursuing draft###picks and free###agents with wide bodies and narrow skill###sets . suddenly , guys like sharp and slick passing defensemen duncan###keith and brent###seabrook had targets up ice with the imagination and ability to finish plays . except at first , nobody noticed . a decade or so of continuing futility in a city where the gold###standard is the cubs at a century and counting kept all but the hardcore fans away . tight fisted owner william dollar bill wirtz stubbornly kept games off tv , and drove off legacy names like bobby###hull and stan###mikita . then wirtz died in september 2007 following a brief battle with cancer and the bitterness spilled out in one sweeping gesture . during a moment of silence for wirtz at the home###opener , the crowd responded with boos . the hawks made the postseason after a six season hiatus , but those fans who chose self exile only grudgingly began trickling back . it was n't until wirtz' son , rocky , was in control for a full season putting the games back on tv , bringing guys like hull and mikita back as ambassadors and putting up statues outside the united###center that all was forgiven , and then some . average attendance jumped , 000 seats by the end of the 2008 09 season . the product on the ice was reflected in the fast climbing value of the franchise . the season after that brought the team 's fourth stanley###cup title , giving one of the nhl 's original six some recent###history worth boasting about . the realities of the salary###cap , though , dictated what happened next . the blackhawks had to unload or choose not to resign nine players on that team , electing instead to lock up toews , kane , keith and a handful of others . they got ambushed in their first postseason outings the next two years something the blackhawks remembered when they were down 3 1 in a series against detroit in an earlier round , and again against boston as the clock ticked down the final few seconds . you win it once and you think you 're going right back to the stanley###cup###finals the next year after that , toews said . two first round exits for us last couple years will make you realize how tough it is to get here . the blackhawks have become the first team to win a second stanley###cup in the salary###cap age , a bit of smart spending that would have pleased old man wirtz . and they did it as the last team standing from a final four that featured the last four cup###winners , playing wide###open or gritty as each game or each shift demanded . as talk of a third cup and even the dreaded dynasty began###making the rounds , quenneville put up his hand and asked for a moment where he did n't have to recall what was behind or worry about what was ahead . i 'm going to enjoy this one first , he said , and have fun with it . and then we 'll talk about that one . jim litke is a national###sports columnist for the associated press . write to him at jlitke ap . org and follow him at twitter . com jimlitke .
on thursday###morning the oscar nominees will at last be revealed , giving shape to what has been an unusually multidimensional race . the stars and directors of contenders like lincoln , argo , zero dark thirty , silver###linings###playbook and django###unchained have been making the rounds to drum up support . for some of them by thursday###afternoon it will be time to pack up the borrowed finery and the studio approved talking###points , and go home . for others it will be the next leg of the race a six week sprint to a finish###line that involves potentially hefting a gold statuette on feb . 24 and delivering an embarrassing ( or sweet , or funny , or ideally , all three ) acceptance###speech . as a primer for those left standing and entertainment for those following along here are some memories of oscar experiences from previous###winners and nominees , excerpted from interviews at premieres and galas this season . i have a memory of a lovely lady who took me by the hand the one that was free , the other one holding the oscar and said you are in shock right now , and you will not ever remember meeting me , but just trust me , i lead you out of here . and she did . like , right backstage , one step off , there she was , taking my hand , and saying , you will not remember me , trust me . and she was totally wrong , because that 's the thing i remember the best . i was eight months###pregnant , so a lot of my memory was centering around well , needing to urinate actually often , and you know , the thing , the fear that you have that you 're going to be in the can when your name is called . there was a huge amount of excitement , huge amount of anxiety that comes from being at the oscars for the first time and being very pregnant . i also get really sad . i had designed such a clever dress that people who did n't know me , that did n't know i was pregnant , probably thought i was just chubby . i wish i 'd worn a tighter dress that definitely showed for sure i was pregnant . sally###field 1980 best actress winner , norma###rae and best actress winner , places in the heart in 1985 ( when she memorably said , you like me ! ) my identifying moment of the first time i went to the oscars was that i won , so that 's a good memory . i do n't actually remember much . so then therefore , the second time i won , i was like possessed and determined that i would own it in a different way . i remember being like a stunned mullet . a mullet is a fish , and when they catch them , they makes cross###eyed face . the oscar buzz when i was nominated was totally overwhelming . i think i can cope with anything now that i 've coped with that . it was huge . it makes you realize , coming from a small country like australia , what an enormous industry it is in america . kathryn###bigelow 2010 best director and best picture winner , the hurt###locker i remember it being extremely surreal , surprising , shocking and more gratifying than you can imagine . mark###boal 2010 best original screenplay and best picture winner , the hurt###locker i remember the aftermath . it was like being on liquid prozac . i was antidepressed . i remember talking to tim###burton and helena###bonham###carter . i talked to them quite a bit . i remember talking to david###fincher a fellow nominee for the social###network quite a lot and some director saying that backstage they thought it was all a bit demanding , and i said i was happy to be there . because you get to a certain age and you can appreciate all of it . this can all feel like a grind to everybody , but i 've got to be honest with you , if you get to make a picture that 's emotional and based on real people , that 's privilege no . privilege no . 2 is if it gets to find an audience and have a great cast . we had a great time because we sort of knew we were n't going to win anything we were just there for the fun of it . i got to meet a lot of people whose work i really admire . i was very moved to see larry###mcmurtry , and to see him and his partner diana###ossana win for brokeback###mountain . and we stayed at the pavilion , and they made a chocolate version of the oscar and put it in your room , whether you win or lose . i 'm sitting at the oscars , pretty sure that i 'm going to direct les miz but not sure at all who i 'm going to cast . and anne###hathaway steps forth , to the front of the stage and sings a rendition of on my own , to hugh###jackman . and i 'm going hold on a second , is anne###hathaway using the oscar stage as the ultimate auditioning platform for her talents and is she also suggesting hugh###jackman while she 's at it ? or is this just coincidence ? she claims it 's coincidence . i think she 's too shrewd . but we 'll never know . dustin###hoffman seven time best actor nominee , starting with the graduate in 1968 and including two awards , in 1980 for kramer vs . kramer and in 1989 for rain###man well , the first year thing i think of is , i wanted to make a political statement . senator eugene###mccarthy was then running for president , and i took one of his daughters ellen mccarthy to the oscars . al###pacino when told mr . hoffman 's story about choosing a date as a political statement
this spring , the missouri chamber of commerce urged the state legislature to accept the federal###government 's plan to expand medicaid for the poor and disabled . the business lobbying group had not suddenly gone rogue . here is how daniel p . mehan , its president , summarized his feelings about president###obama 's health###care law we do n't like it . but the chamber was cognizant of the plea of its members directly###affected by the issue dozens of missouri hospitals stood to lose . 2 billion over six years in federal support for uncompensated care if the state refused to increase the income ceiling for medicaid eligibility . pragmatism suggested accepting the expansion . washington would pay the extra cost entirely for three years and pick up 90 percent of the bill thereafter . and it would expand health###coverage in the state 's poor , predominantly###white rural###counties , which voted###consistently to put republican###lawmakers into office . missouri 's republican###controlled###legislature heavy with tea###party stalwarts rejected medicaid 's expansion in the state anyway . after their vote , a frustrated editorial in the missourian , a faithfully conservative newspaper in washington , mo . , asked of the state 's elected republicans who do they represent ? today , the same forces that blocked the expansion of medicaid in missouri are going all out in washington in a bid to undo all of the affordable###care###act . bowing to the vehemence of its tea###party faction , the house g.o.p . forced a government###shutdown when senate democrats refused to delay or defund the president 's health overhaul . house republicans are threatening even further damage if they do n't get their way , possibly unleashing financial chaos if they manage to force the united###states into its first default ever on the government 's debt . republicans' efforts raise the same perplexing question posed by the missourian what drives tea###party republicans and their financial###backers ? what calculation persuades them that repealing the health###care law is worth the risk ? indeed , whose interests do they represent ? nearly 6 in 10 americans disapprove of trying to stop the law by cutting its financing . even among those who do n't like the law , less than half want their representatives in congress to try to make it fail . it is tempting to discard the tea###party activists driving the republican###party as crazy as some commentators have motivated by fear and willing to believe that default wo n't cause much harm and might even act as a purgative to free the economy of a bloated government . they listen to nobody but themselves , the harvard political###scientist theda###skocpol told me . they are convinced of their rectitude and convinced that they alone are qualified to save###america from the dire threat of obama and his polices . they have worked themselves into a dangerous###place . their relationship with reality can take peculiar turns . reflexive opponents of government , they can exhibit little sense of what the government actually does . and yet the argument that half the republican###party has simply lost its mind has to be an unsatisfactory answer , especially considering the sophistication of some of the deep pocketed backers of the tea###party insurgency . there is a plausible alternative to irrationality . flawed though it may turn out to be , obamacare , as the affordable###care###act is popularly known , could fundamentally###change the relationship between working americans and their government . this could pose an existential###threat to the small###government credo that has defined the g.o.p . for four decades . the law is imperfect . it has dozens of complicated , interlocking parts . half of americans say they do n't###understand how it will affect them and their family . still , the law has many provisions that are likely to improve life for millions of americans , including a big portion of what we know as the working middle###class . almost two thirds of uninsured americans have a full time job , according to the kaiser###family###foundation . a further 16 percent are employed part time . the department of health###and###human###services recently estimated that nearly six in 10 uninsured americans could qualify for health###coverage in the insurance market for less than 100 per person per month . according to an analysis by the urban###institute , 28 million americans would gain health###insurance under obamacare . of these , eight million earn more than twice the poverty level of , 100 for a family of four . a majority of those would get a subsidy to buy a plan . as it turns out , the core tea###party demographic working white men between the ages of 45 and 64 would do fairly well under the law . take missouri . it has about , 000 uninsured . almost half of them would have been eligible for expanded medicaid benefits , had the legislature not rejected them . many of the rest including families of four making up to , 000 will be eligible to get subsidized health###insurance . in st . louis , for instance , a family of four making , 000 a year will be able to buy a middle of the road silver health plan for 282 a month and a bottom end bronze plan for . even medicare recipients will get a benefit worth a few hundred dollars a year . in , when president###bill###clinton took an earlier stab at a health###care overhaul , the conservative thinker william###kristol published a manifesto about why republicans had to stop it . passage of the clinton health plan in any form would be disastrous , mr . kristol wrote , italicizing for emphasis . it would guarantee an unprecedented federal intrusion into the american economy . its success would signal the rebirth of centralized welfare###state policy at the moment that such policy is being perceived as a failure in other areas . two decades after mr . clinton 's ultimately###failed attempt , obamacare poses the same sort of threat . even americans who say they dislike the law actually like many of its components . nearly three quarters approve of giving financial help to poor and moderate income americans to buy health###insurance . two thirds approve of barring insurance###companies from denying coverage because of somebody 's medical###history . three quarters favor letting children stay on their parents' insurance until they are . until now , social###welfare###programs in the united###states have exhibited a big###hole , professor skocpol said , consisting of nonpoor working###age americans and their children . obamacare closes a big chunk of it . the main beneficiaries tend to have lower###wages , employed in smaller###businesses that

one run was a hopeful sign , maybe signaling the start of something grand for the yankees in the first inning against the kansas###city###royals on tuesday . then that little number on the scoreboard evolved into a mocking symbol of the yankees' offensive futility , followed by so many zeros , so many lost opportunities . the yankees' lineup at first seemed to be at its slap hit best , then returned to its slap hit worst , as the team fell quietly to the royals for a second straight night , 3 1 , at yankee###stadium . they managed six hits , all singles . they scored in the first inning by bunting , running , spraying the field with hits doing all their standard small###ball mischief to wring some offense out of a bone dry lineup . but one small drip of a run was all that came . i understand the effort that they 're giving , manager joe###girardi said . and that 's all i can ask . girardi has grown exhausted of excusing his team 's anemic offense for a while now . the trajectory , of late , seems to be heading only further downward . the yankees have only three extra###base###hits in the past five games . they have hit only 15 home###runs in their last 30 games . they have dropped to 26th in the majors in on base plus slugging###percentage . the cleanup###hitter , travis###hafner , is batting . 177 with 20 runs batted in since april . the leadoff###hitter , brett###gardner , was 0 for 16 before a bunt single to lead off the bottom of the first tuesday . we have not scored a ton of runs all year long , that 's the bottom line , girardi said . as i said during spring###training , we 're going to have to win a lot of close###games . we were not going to score the runs we did last year . and that 's what we 're going through . gardner 's leadoff###single was followed by a base hit by ichiro###suzuki and another by robinson cano , scoring gardner for a 1 0 lead against james###shields . a fourth###single by zoilo almonte with one out loaded the bases . but shields bore down , striking out lyle###overbay and retiring eduardo nunez on a fly ball to deep center###field to end the inning . and then the struggling yankees settled back into hibernation against shields , the familiar ace formerly with the tampa###bay###rays , who struck out five in seven innings . after the first , only three yankees hitters reached###base off shields , two of them on walks . they hit into two double plays . no runner advanced###past second . you want to cash in and get runs early against shields , hafner said . once he gets into a rhythm , he can be tough . the yankees' first inning run was enough for starter c . c . sabathia until the sixth , when david lough hit a home###run to right field to tie the score . an inning later , billy butler homered to left off a missed sabathia fastball , giving kansas###city the lead . i did n't see the replay , sabathia said , but i feel like i should 've gotten it in more . it was only the royals' third hit off sabathia , who threw his 37th career###complete###game , allowing seven hits with two walks and six strikeouts . but he fell to 9 7 on the season . in the bottom of the eighth , kansas###city 's left###handed reliever tim###collins allowed a one out single to gardner , then had to face cano representing the tying run with two outs and gardner on second . but after four foul###balls , collins struck out cano on a 1 2 changeup . greg###holland retired the yankees in order in the ninth for his 22nd save . with their current offense scuffling , and derek###jeter and alex###rodriguez nearing activation , several yankees acknowledged that it had been hard not to grow too anxious anticipating their return . it would seem that no time would be better than now . leadership , overbay said , is one thing the team has lacked without jeter , its captain . he 's got that ability where we can relax , he gets us going , overbay said . we 're all kind of looking around at each other we do n't have that . it 's those little things that i think play a big role . but with that optimism , there is caution . leadership aside , jeter will not be able to hit 30 home###runs , girardi said . rodriguez has not discovered any fountain of youth . but the yankees are clinging to the hope that something , anything , will happen just by those two players finally stepping through the clubhouse doors . just having them in the lineup , sabathia said , hopefully will change everything . alex###rodriguez was 0 for 3 with two strikeouts and a groundout playing third base for class a tampa on tuesday , his fifth rehabilitation game . rodriguez is 1 for 12 combined with class a charleston and tampa . rodriguez is scheduled to meet with baseball investigators friday to answer###questions about his links to an anti###aging clinic in south###florida that is suspected of distributing performance enhancers to various players , according to a person familiar with the matter .

london a couple of weeks before the start of the english###premier###league season , britain 's most exciting player , its most reviled and the linchpin of the england side are involved in emotional and financial tug of wars with their clubs . gareth###bale , luis suarez and wayne###rooney have been absent from recent pre###season###friendlies because they are carrying injuries , are in no state to perform or have been banished from the first team . winner of last season 's english player of the year awards , tottenham 's bale has been dazzled by the chance to join real###madrid , the most decorated of europe 's big###clubs . but his club 's chairman , daniel###levy , has a reputation for playing hardball and real are almost certainly going to have to break the world transfer###record to take the spurs defender turned winger turned all round attacking talent to the bernabeu . bale 's speed and power , abetted by a hammer shot and a fine dribbling instinct , have been tottenham 's greatest###assets in the past two seasons when they narrowly###missed out on champions###league football . the 24 year old came to international notice during tottenham 's run to the champions###league last eight in 2010 11 and is desperate for more of the same , all but guaranteed at real . but , for now , levy is standing firm with british media suggesting real may need to cough up 100 million###pounds ( 155 million ) to change his mind , eclipsing the 80 million they paid for cristiano###ronaldo when he left manchester united in . if you say 100 million i would say that seems a lot ... for anything , real###madrid president florentino perez told###espn . champions###league football is also behind suarez 's desire to leave liverpool . but once again during his turbulent spell in england , the uruguayan is making few friends with his approach to a 40 million###pound bid from arsenal . there is confusion about what suarez was promised when he signed a new deal last year , and what is involved if another club makes an offer for the striker , but if any club deserved to be treated with consideration by their player , it is liverpool . they have supported their top scorer , a lightning conductor for trouble during his 2 1 2 years at anfield , through two major storms his racist outburst at manchester united 's patrice###evra and his biting of chelsea 's branislav ivanovic . he will miss early games in the new season because he is still serving a 10 match###ban for the ivanovic incident . now liverpool manager brendan###rodgers , after weeks of warm words for his player and denials he wanted to sell him , has had enough after suarez demanded liverpool honour our agreement . rodgers denies making any promises about suarez being allowed to leave , has accused him of total disrespect and has banned him from training with the rest of the liverpool squad . the eagerness of bale and suarez to break contracts they signed just a year ago are wearisomely familiar to clubs and fans up and down the country , but the situation surrounding rooney also has the potential to cause serious damage to england 's most famous club , manchester united . rooney , often referred to as england 's only world###class footballer , has been at old trafford since 2004 and been instrumental in the club winning five premier###league titles and one champions###league crown . but united , the defending###champions , are in a state of flux and the last thing they want is to lose their talisman striker , with a scoring###record of one goal in every two games . the very last thing they want is for rooney to depart for jose mourinho 's chelsea , one of their two main###rivals for this season 's title . it is rare for top english players to go from one elite premier###league###club to a rival and his exit would be a serious blow to united manager david###moyes . moyes is in the very early###stages of trying to build a profile at united after taking over from alex###ferguson following his fellow scot 's 27 years of ruling the old trafford roost . players and fans used to ferguson 's uncompromising###attitude are watching closely to see if moyes has got what it takes to control an ego filled dressing###room , and particularly rooney , who has been told he will not be allowed to leave . moyes was the teenage rooney 's manager at everton and frustratingly for the new boss , rooney 's main beef seems to be with ferguson who remains a major force at united even after retirement . united have not impressed in pre###season###friendlies and whether rooney stays or goes could have a major influence on the champions' fortunes this season and whether moyes is given the time to build an empire to rival ferguson 's .

the chemical###reactions that help produce margarine , medications , cleaner car exhaust and countless other useful things rely on valuable###metals like platinum , rhodium and ruthenium as catalysts . but such metals are rare , expensive and occasionally toxic . for years , scientists have tried to develop methods of catalysis using cheap , common , nonpolluting metals like iron and cobalt . now , three separate###teams of researchers say they have developed catalysts based on cheap metals that can either match or outperform those based on precious###metals . the three studies were published in the journal science . in one study , university of toronto researchers###showed that attaching certain organic###molecules to iron , then dissolving it in a solution , created an efficient catalyst for producing alcohols and amines used in perfumes and medications . the chemical###industry has traditionally relied on ruthenium , an extremely###rare metal , to catalyze such reactions . it shows that with the right organic molecule attached to it , we can make iron do things that were n't thought possible before , said robert h . morris , an author of the study . there are likely more iron catalysts to be found , he said , but cautioned that there is still a ways to go between discovery and application . still , all three studies presented different approaches to cheap metal catalyzing , illustrating that there is no exclusive single 'recipe' for success , wrote r . morris bullock , a chemist with the pacific###northwest###national###laboratory , in an accompanying article .
atlanta from the sublime emotional high provided by matt###harvey and zack wheeler , the mets ' young , hard throwing right handers , the team on wednesday descended back to the realities of its everyday existence . harvey and wheeler , who each secured a win during the mets' doubleheader sweep of the atlanta###braves on tuesday , will remain a walking advertisement for the team 's future . but however sunnier the outlook seemed after harvey 's dominant showing and wheeler 's scintillating major###league###debut , it remained clear that there were gaps to fill and problems to address . before the mets lost , 5 3 , to the braves on wednesday at turner###field , manager terry###collins was reiterating a simple goal for the struggles to end , if only to further advertise the team 's future . we 'd like to play very well in the second half and get our fan###base excited for , he said . but on wednesday###night , the starting###pitching situation moved from the sublime to the absurd . shaun###marcum , making his ninth start and 11th appearance over all , saw his record fall to . only two other mets pitchers have gotten off to worse starts . he gave up five runs in four and two thirds innings . marcum allowed a three run homer to chris###johnson , the no . 8 hitter , in the fourth , and allowed two more runs during a sloppy fifth inning . it seems like every mistake 's getting hit , if not in the gap , over the fence , marcum said . i guess it 's part of the game , and you 've just got to live with it . you go through stretches where that happens , and unfortunately , it 's been a two and a half month ordeal for me so far . the mets' offense , in turn , was relatively quiet , getting two runs against starter kris###medlen when he made a throwing###error in the fifth and another that inning when kirk nieuwenhuis flared a broken bat hit to right . the ball 's not falling his way , but we have n't given him run support , either , catcher john###buck said of marcum . playing well , it seemed , would remain an ongoing###project . to that end , the mets , whose clubhouse of late has resembled a game of musical###chairs , added more new faces before wednesday 's game . among them was eric###young jr . , who was acquired in a trade with the colorado###rockies and put into the leadoff spot while playing center###field . collins said young , a switch###hitter , would see considerable time . i 'm excited for the opportunity , and excited to play with these guys , said young , who grew up in new jersey and was batting . 242 this year . he finished 1 for 4 during wednesday 's loss . young became the mets' 10th leadoff###hitter this season . to an extent , he appears to fit the mets' modus###operandi this season shuffling modest pieces to survive over a stretch of time . young has a . 261 average in 766 career at bats and has limited###power . but he has exceptional speed , and collins said young gave the mets something they had been lacking since jose reyes left the team after the 2011 season . also joining the outfield carousel wednesday was andrew###brown , who was hot at the plate this month in class###aaa . meanwhile , reliever scott atchison was put on the disabled###list , a day after he was taken off it . atchison , who returned monday from an elbow injury , pulled a groin while warming up . over the longer###term , the mets will have decisions to make about their pitching staff . they will use a six man rotation , including wheeler , for the near future . but collins said the team would most certainly be back to five after the all star break early next month , if not sooner . before the game , collins was asked if marcum , who signed a one year , 4 million deal last winter and can increase that figure through performance incentives , would be in danger of losing his spot despite having a larger salary and more major###league experience than jeremy hefner and dillon###gee . collins did not offer any guarantees . i think we 're going to take the five guys that are the best to run out there every fifth day and what gives us the best opportunity to win , he said . one day after watching wheeler 's debut , collins was marveling at the way he put the mets in a position to win . here 's a guy last night that did n't have his best command of things , and yet still gave you six zeros , collins said . i tell you what , our guys are going to learn , that is a good guy to play behind , when you know you can have an off night and still shut the other team down . to be determined over the coming###weeks will be the guys who actually do play behind him and how well they do it .
rancho###mirage , calif . the appearance near the top of the kraft###nabisco###championship leader board of jodi ewart shadoff , a nonwinner on the l.p.g.a . tour , came as no surprise to the sports anchor where she lives in sarasota , fla . he pointed out that ewart shadoff ranked second on the tour in greens in regulation and was in the top 25 in driving accuracy . yes , adam shadoff , the anchor , does his homework on local###athletes , especially his wife , who was tied for fifth after a 36 hole###score of four under par , three strokes behind the leader inbee###park , who carded a . the couple , who were married in january , met in albuquerque , n.m. , in 2008 when ewart shadoff was a sophomore standout on the university of new mexico women 's golf team and shadoff was the reporter at the local###cbs###affiliate assigned to interview her after her victory in the mountain###west championship . it was not love at first sight for ewart shadoff , an englishwoman , mainly because she never saw shadoff 's face , which was obscured by the bulky camera he was operating . she got her first good look at him shortly thereafter when he sent her a message on facebook inviting her to play a round of golf . she accepted , and shadoff , who said he then played to a 2 handicap , insisted she play from the back tees and proceeded to beat her . i shot one over par , he said by telephone between shots friday during a round at albuquerque country###club . it was the only time i 've ever beat her . ewart shadoff was not the least put off by her future###husband 's competitive###nature . she comes from a family of athletes . her father , a former boxer , worked for a time as a jockey and was a horse exercise trainer as was her mother , who ran track as a youth . i think the competitiveness definitely shines in me , said ewart shadoff , who showed###potential in soccer before deciding to focus her energies on golf . i 'll tell you what 's unbelievable , shadoff said . we play ping###pong , and she beats me all the time . her hand###eye###coordination is so good . it 's totally embarrassing when your wife is always beating you . last year , her first full season on the tour , ewart shadoff , 25 , posted two top 10 finishes . she tied for seventh at the kia###classic and tied for ninth at the sybase match###play championship on the strength of victories against suzann###pettersen and sophie###gustafson , who have 15 l.p.g.a . tour victories between them . her to do list for 2013 includes competing alongside pettersen and the other top european players against the united###states in the solheim###cup . her opening 68 here got the attention of the european solheim###cup captain , liselotte###neumann , and the assistant captain , annika sorenstam , who is providing###commentary for golf###channel . ewart shadoff completed her first round near nightfall on thursday and began her second round friday before 9 a.m . tied for first . the short turnaround was a blessing , affording her little time to think about leading a major for the first time . it would have been a lot###worse to have it the opposite way around to sit and dwell on where i was at the time , she said . at the end of , ewart shadoff switched to a belly putter , she said , after taking 37 strokes on the greens in a competitive round . she is one of the few players on the women 's tour who uses an anchored stroke , but she does not dwell on it . all you have to do is look at my putting stats to know it 's not a huge advantage , said ewart shadoff , who is ranked 127th on tour in putting . the united###states###golf###association and the royal and ancient , the co governing###bodies of golf , have proposed an anchoring ban . if they decide to put it into effect , ewart shadoff will keep calm and carry on . to be honest , she said , if they do ban it , it would n't be a huge issue for me . ewart shadoff 's husband studied broadcasting at syracuse , and he remains a fervent follower of his alma###mater 's basketball###team . it is probably for the best that he is in albuquerque this weekend visiting family and not on the air in sarasota . it would have been a tough call , he conceded , if he had to choose between showing highlights of syracuse 's game against michigan in atlanta and ewart shadoff 's third round . i do my best to remain impartial , shadoff said . i would only show highlights of her or syracuse if it 's really worth it . his thursday###night sports package included a short on the high###school team of the week , highlights of the rays and the lightning and 30 seconds of golf . shadoff showed snippets of jessica###korda , another local golfer who opened with a , and ewart shadoff . nice , ewart shadoff said , laughing . that must have been really awkward for him to talk about his wife .
raleigh , n.c . in a move some are calling a modern day scarlet###letter and others say is the best way to manage changing federal immigration###policy , north###carolina this month will begin giving some young immigrants driver 's licenses marked with a bold pink stripe and the words no lawful status printed in red . the licenses were developed as a way for the state to cope with a quirk in the deferred###action###for###childhood###arrivals program , which the obama administration began last year to deal with the as many as . 7 million young immigrants across the country who were brought to the united###states by their parents and have been living here illegally since . under the program , young people who qualify receive deferrals from deportation for two years . they are no longer illegal , but they do not become fully legal either . while the program allows them work permits , many still need to drive to their jobs . so in january , the federal###agency that administers the program determined that immigrants with deferrals were just legal enough to qualify for driver 's licenses . although a majority of states are issuing the licenses , each is choosing a different path . ohio officials leave it up to individual motor###vehicle offices , although two state###senators this week introduced a bill to make the licenses mandatory . michigan officials###announced last month that they would hand out licenses after first refusing , a move that had brought a lawsuit from the american###civil###liberties###union and the national immigration###law center . the governors of arizona and nebraska still will not issue driver 's licenses . in february , national legal rights and immigration groups filed a federal class###action###lawsuit challenging arizona 's position on constitutional###grounds . at first , north###carolina balked , too . when the state 's attorney###general ruled in january that the licenses were legal , the state transportation###department devised what officials###believed was a way to thread the needle between opposing###factions . gov . pat###mccrory , the newly###elected republican , has called the pink trimmed licenses a pragmatic compromise . but for some of the nearly , 000 people who have applied for status under the deferred action program in north###carolina , the pink tinged licenses are humiliating . they say the licenses could set them up for more harassment in a state that , like many , is struggling to cope with changing###demographics . more than anything , it 's that we are already targeted , said jose rico , 23 , whose parents arrived in the united###states from mexico on a tourist visa when he was 13 and have never left . mr . rico is studying###engineering at a durham community###college and is part of the n . c . dream###team , a grass###roots organization of illegal###immigrant youth . he worries that with a pink striped license he will get harassed at bars , banks and airports the places where people regularly present a driver 's license without a second thought . it says right there you have no lawful status , which is true , but you are giving that to people who do not need to know your status , he said . it only opens us up for more harassment . on monday , a group of democratic###legislators introduced a bill to make sure that all driver 's licenses issued by the state were indistinguishable . it is offensive to me that the governor would put a stigma upon young people who are legal , said state representative paul luebke , democrat of durham , one of the bill 's sponsors . he is particularly concerned about how the licenses might affect the holder 's job###prospects . why should someone who has gone through the process and gotten their papers have to go through hoops to explain to a potential employer exactly who they are because they have a driver 's license with a pink stripe on it ? mr . luebke said . some republican###lawmakers opposed to issuing any licenses at all to the young immigrants have introduced their own bills , asking that the licenses not be issued until june , by which time they hope to determine if the governor has stretched his constitutional###powers . members of religious###groups in north###carolina have also criticized the state 's decision to issue the licenses . when rabbi john friedman told members of judea reform###congregation in durham about the new licenses at services friday , he said he heard an audible gasp . he and other clergy members are encouraging their followers to stick a piece of pink tape on their licenses in solidarity and protest . it 's punitive , said the rev . richard edens of the united###church of chapel###hill . it just continues a sense of shame and humiliation . north###carolina also plans to issue a new generation of driver 's licenses for the entire state by the end of the year . there will be distinguishing###marks for other noncitizens , including permanent###residents and other visa holders , but it is unclear whether the pink stripes will continue , said greer beaty , a spokeswoman for the transportation###department .

last year , malibu , calif . , was one of several thousand communities across the country that received federal###grants intended to improve the lot of low###and###moderate###income residents . but instead of putting the , 866 it received to work on an eligible project , like restoring houses , the city did what dozens of other well off municipalities have done it sold its grants to other communities in exchange for smaller purses that had no strings attached . such wheeling and dealing is longstanding practice in los###angeles###county , stretching back at least 25 years . local###officials describe the horse###trading as a way to redirect money from communities that lacked eligible projects or had ample money of their own to areas that needed them more . and with congress regularly lowering the amount it disburses through the community###development###block###grant program , the exchanges have allowed communities to bundle modest allotments into bigger ones . while the practice has often been presented as advantageous for the communities that buy and sell the grants , not everyone agrees that it makes the best use of the 3 billion or so that congress has been devoting to the annual program . brian e . sullivan , a spokesman for the federal department of housing###and###urban###development , said in an e mail that while not expressly prohibited by law or regulation , the department strongly discourages such sales . senator tom###coburn , republican of oklahoma , simply views the practice as a waste of public resources . what it tells you is they did n't need the money , he said . the authorization for the program says you 're supposed to be giving it to the communities that need it , so why would beverly###hills need a c.d.b.g . block###grant ? the community###development###block###grant program , signed into law by president gerald r . ford in , gives communities more say over how public money is spent . it is not clear why the trading has not caught on more broadly across the country . mayor j . christian bollwage of elizabeth , n.j. , who has been active in community development for two decades , said he doubted that there were any instances of trading in his region , given the broad need for money . suffice to say , that is not happening in connecticut , new york or new jersey , he said . in the dozens of cases that are documented , the selling city relinquishes its claim to thousands of dollars of promised grants in exchange for a payment , typically set at 60 cents or so on the dollar . whatever the agreement , the federal###government will disburse the same amount that it had committed to pay . but the community that ultimately puts the money to work will receive less than if it had received the grant directly . regulators at the federal department of housing###and###urban###development had tolerated these arrangements until fairly###recently . they did issue a warning to milwaukee###county in 2011 after a wisconsin newspaper reported that one of the county 's richer suburbs , river hills , was routinely trying to sell its grant allocation . threatened with penalties , the county took that option off the table . until mr . coburn questioned the practice in his annual chronicle of government waste in october , federal###regulators had raised few objections in los###angeles###county . there , a virtual bazaar had openly flourished for decades under the supervision of the los###angeles###county community development###commission . county officials are convinced that it was mr . coburn 's criticism that prompted a cease###and###desist###letter they received in october from yolanda chavez , a deputy###assistant###secretary at the housing###department in washington . if cooperating jurisdictions cannot use their annual allocations , she wrote , the funds should revert to the county and be reallocated to areas of highest need . county officials say they have complied by passing along ms . chavez 's request to the 48 cities that receive block###grants from the county . if it 's going to raise eyebrows , we 'll figure out another way to help our cities function , said terry gonzalez , a top official at the community development###commission . that change is already being felt by cities that had been active in the brisk###trade . county records show that 14 of its 48 participating municipalities had signed away their rights last year to receive . 1 million in federal###grants for the current###fiscal year in return for , 000 in payments that were free and clear . eager for bigger allocations , torrance , san###fernando and hawaiian gardens each picked up more than , 000 in grants to bolster their usual allotment . la###mirada , the standout of the bunch , stitched together nearly , 000 in grants from nine sellers , averaging 70 cents on the dollar for the privilege . that does n't seem in keeping with the spirit of the program , said mark elliot , a californian who objected on his blog , better bike , last march when beverly###hills struck a similar deal with a city 30 miles to the south . why trade away , 000 bucks at a discount to the city of hawaiian gardens , of all places , when that federal funding could help house people of modest means or less mobile seniors at home , mr . elliot said at the time . municipal records suggest that the money beverly###hills and other affluent communities earn under the formula often idles as they struggle to find eligible ways to put the awards to work . in a report written last april , malibu officials stuck to a line they had been using as far back as 2008 to lobby the city###council for the release and sale of the federal###grants . the city has not been able to identify a project that meets the criteria of the funding , the report said . in a similar memorandum drafted last march for its city###council , beverly###hills explained why it had felt###compelled to sell the grants . it can be particularly difficult for cities such as beverly###hills , which does not have any qualified low income areas , to find c.d.b.g . eligible projects , it said , adding that , staff has been researching promising projects , but none are ready to fund . stockpiling the money until qualified projects emerged would only expose it to recapture if it appeared that the grants were languishing , according to the memo . some of those headaches could be avoided , the memo said , if the city###council approved the sale of grants to hawaiian gardens at 70 cents on the dollar . ms . gonzalez defended the county 's allocation method , which is modeled on the federal###government 's and factors in population , poverty and overcrowding , as the fairest way to proceed . judged by that standard , she said , beverly###hills and other suburbs were entitled to a share of the proceeds . they qualify , ms . gonzalez said . it 's borne out , it 's indisputable and it 's fair .
washington as more nuclear###reactors across the country are closed , the problem of what to do with their waste is becoming more urgent , government officials and private experts said at a conference here this week . to address the problem , a bipartisan group of four senators introduced a bill on thursday that would provide for temporary , centralized storage , even as house leaders remained focused on trying to revive plans for the yucca###mountain###nuclear###waste###repository that the obama administration has declared###dead . nuclear###waste is accumulating in steel and concrete storage casks at reactor sites around the country . but the casks sealed boxes of many tons cannot be sent to any repository because they are not compatible , said jeff williams , director of the energy department 's nuclear###fuel storage and transportation###planning project . in addition , a growing number of the sites no longer have an operating reactor or the associated fuel handling###equipment , so they have no way to move the highly###radioactive fuel to another storage package . experts say the amount of orphaned nuclear###waste is mounting . nuclear utilities have announced the retirement of an additional four reactors so far this year , which leaves three more sites without an operating reactor . before that development , the energy department counted nine such sites , with about , 800 tons of fuel in 248 casks and was hoping to establish a pilot scale interim storage plant for that fuel . stored fuel requires guards and other continuing expenses , which are significant if there is no reactor nearby . those expenses eventually fall on federal taxpayers because the energy department has defaulted on contracts it signed in the 1980s to begin accepting the wastes for burial in . as a result , financial###penalties the federal###government must pay to the nuclear utilities for failing to dispose of the waste now amount to hundreds of millions###of###dollars a year . even the concept of an interim site is facing###problems not least a law that bars the use of an interim site until construction has begun at yucca . selecting and opening a new site for permanent disposal would most likely take decades at least , so finding a place for storage in the meantime may strain the definition of interim . solving the interim problem is in turn difficult if there is no long###term solution on the horizon . we understand the idea that you ca n't###pick up fuel stranded in many locations to ultimately have it stranded in one location , said christopher hansen , a senior###policy###adviser in the energy department 's office of nuclear###energy . a commission investigating storage alternatives recommended last year that the government find a willing host , which it called a consent based process . the recommendation is in contrast to congress 's choice of yucca in , over the objections of the host state , nevada . but what exactly consent based means is not clear . mark lombard , the director of spent###fuel storage and transportation at the nuclear###regulatory###commission , which would have to license a permanent repository or an interim storage###site , said , we 're pretty good at solving technical###issues . it 's the consent based process that 's a little bit squishy . and some of the technical questions will take time , including development of rail###cars that can safely hold the casks , experts said . the government has currently paid out about 2 billion in damages , and its liability is rising by hundreds of millions###of###dollars a year . if the government could establish an interim site , it could limit its penalties to about 21 billion , said lake barrett , a former energy department official . but that schedule is ambitious , according to participants in the conference , which was organized by a trade group , the united###states nuclear infrastructure council . how long the fuel can safely sit###in the casks , either at the 120 or so locations where nuclear###reactors have ever operated , or at a smaller###number of centralized spots , is the subject of a separate proceeding at the nuclear###regulatory###commission . the commission has long maintained that the fuel is safe there for decades , but some of it has already been stored for more than 30 years , and it seems certain to be stored there for decades more . some of the younger fuel shows signs of degrading with age . the reason is that in the 1990s , many of the reactors made a transition to fuel assemblies with a rich enough mix of uranium to run for up to six years , instead of the three years that had been standard . the new fuel , called high burn up fuel , spent longer in the harsh###environment of a reactor , and now shows signs of corrosion and cracking .
chicago of course , it was andrew shaw . the pesky little forward always gets up when he 's knocked down . the three overtime opener of the stanley###cup###finals came to a thrilling end at the stroke of midnight wednesday because the tenacious shaw is a whole lot more than his reputation for irritating opposing###players . shaw skated in front of the goal at the right time , deflecting dave###bolland 's tip into the net for the winning score in the chicago###blackhawks' 4 3 victory over the boston###bruins in the fifth longest###game in the history of the stanley###cup . we knew it was n't going to be pretty at that point , shaw said . you could tell both teams were physically exhausted . we 've preached it go to the net , you 'll find a way to get a greasy goal . we did a heck of a job of it there in the third overtime . shaw was knocked down near the boards but got up as the puck came out to michal rozsival , who started the winning sequence with a shot from the right point into traffic . bolland 's tip then went off shaw 's right leg and past tuukka###rask at 08 for his fifth goal of the playoffs . and just like that , the longest finals game in five years was over . shaw skated off to the side and pumped his arms furiously , then joined his teammates for a weary celebration . the bigger the stage , the bigger the challenge , he rises to the occasion , blackhawks coach joel###quenneville said . he knows where the front of net is . does n't have to be pretty . he 's a warrior . he 's one of those guys that you appreciate he 's on your side and he 's relentless . milan###lucic had two goals and an assist for the bruins , who had won five straight and nine of . patrice###bergeron scored a power###play###goal and david krejci finished with two assists . not disappointed in our effort , bruins coach claude julien said . there 's certain things you 're going to want to fix for next game . but as far as the game is concerned , it was a hard fought game . rask made an astounding 59 saves in a finals marathon that passed pittsburgh 's 4 3 win over detroit on june , 2008 , when petr sykora scored at 57 of the third overtime . game 2 is saturday###night at the united###center . that 's playoff hockey , bruins center rich###peverley said . it 's fun to watch , so we 'll think about this until we get out of here and then shake it off and get ready for saturday . the blackhawks won for the eighth time in nine games and improved to 10 1 at home in the playoffs . bolland and johnny oduya scored in the third period for chicago , which never would have made it to the third overtime if not for an impressive performance by goaltender corey###crawford . brandon###saad had his first goal of the playoffs . crawford gave the blackhawks a chance by standing his ground when the bruins had repeated opportunities in the extra sessions . shawn###thornton and daniel###paille skated in for a 2 on 1 in the first ot , and crawford turned away thornton on the doorstep . he denied peverley and tyler###seguin in rapid###succession , and helped chicago kill off two power plays when it was whistled twice for too many men on the ice . nathan###horton hit the post in the first extra session , and zdeno chara 's slap###shot deflected off jaromir###jagr and then the inside of the right post at the very end of the second overtime . it 's exhausting , said crawford , who had 29 of his 51 saves in the overtimes . i just try to tell myself to make the next save , and we 're going to score on our next shot . the action was so fast and furious that it took a toll on the players , with horton skating off during a power play with an injury likely a serious one to leave the ice during that pivotal###moment . the blackhawks trailed 3 1 in the third period before they turned up the pressure on rask , who stepped up when he faced a similar attack from pittsburgh in the eastern###conference###finals . this time , he coughed up the lead , hurt by one unlucky carom . first , bolland converted a nice pass from shaw for his first goal of the playoffs . then oduya 's long slap###shot went off the left skate of boston defenseman andrew###ference and into the net for the tying###goal with 46 remaining in regulation . oduya 's shot was going wide if it did n't hit ference 's skate . we were up two goals and all of a sudden the game was tied , said bruins defenseman zdeno chara , who had more than 45 minutes of ice time . we 've got two days to regroup and get ready for the next game . the sellout###crowd of , 110 cheered as krejci and chicago captain jonathan###toews stared each other down for the opening faceoff of the first stanley###cup###finals between original six franchises in 34 years . and it almost did n't###happen . game 1 came exactly five months after the official end of a long and bitter lockout . the labor dispute wiped out 510 games , but the sides managed to come together in time to save an abbreviated 48 game season and playoffs . they were rewarded with a final playoff###series between two big market teams with passionate followings and scores of top players . led by toews and a group of skilled forwards , the blackhawks returned to the stanley###cup###finals for the first time since they won it all three year ago . boston won the title the following season , and the same core of players is at the center of this year 's playoff###run . it was enough to attract the attention of president###barack###obama , who has a home in chicago and made it clear who he was pulling for before the opener . he wished the blackhawks good luck over twitter before adding hope to welcome you back to the white###house again as stanleycup champs . boston countered with a rolling###stone mick###jagger tweeted a picture of himself holding a bruins jersey before a show at td###garden . the bruins got off to fast###start behind lucic , who converted a nice pass from horton for the first goal of the series at 11 in the first . lucic set up his second goal with a little dirty work . he won the puck in a scrum along the boards , got a pass from krejci and fired it into the right side just 51 seconds into the second period , extending boston 's lead to 2 0 with his fifth goal of the playoffs . the two goal lead looked like a sure bet with rask in net , but the blackhawks found a way to get back into the game against the red###hot goaltender . marian hossa stole the puck from dennis###seidenberg in the boston end and fed saad , who one timed it past rask at 08 in the second . saad 's goal ended a scoreless###streak of 149 minutes and 36 seconds for rask dating to game 3 of the sweep against the penguins . that got the crowd going again , and the blackhawks drew a pair of penalties in rapid###succession to earn a 5 on 3 power play for 17 . with the prime opportunity to move into a tie , they passed the puck around too much and the bruins easily killed off both penalties . notes it was the first game between the teams since boston 's 3 2 shootout###victory on oct . 15 , 2011 . there were no games against teams from the other conference during the lockout###shortened season . ... this is the first playoff###series between the teams since boston swept chicago in the 1978 quarterfinals . the bruins won five of their six previous postseason###series against the blackhawks .
washington the supreme###court on thursday reinforced the ability of corporations to write their own rules for resolving###disputes with customers , finding that a group of merchants were bound by an arbitration agreement with american###express even if the terms made it prohibitively###expensive to pursue some types of claims against the company . businesses generally###regard arbitration as a cheaper and more efficient way to resolve###disputes . consumer advocates say the terms of the agreements can allow companies to escape accountability . the courts increasingly have sided with the companies , steadily limiting the circumstances in which customers can pursue claims outside of the arbitration process . thursday 's 5 to 3 ruling limits the ability of customers to pursue class###actions . the conservative majority held that companies could require individual arbitration even if a class###action is the only way to make the claim economically viable . the law , justice antonin###scalia wrote , does not guarantee an affordable procedural path to the vindication of every claim . business groups hailed the ruling as the end of a long legal battle . the supreme###court today eliminated the last significant###obstacle to adoption of fair , efficient arbitration systems that increase access to justice for consumers while reducing transaction###costs for everyone , andrew j . pincus , a lawyer at mayer###brown who won a related supreme###court arbitration case in , said in a statement after the announcement . consumer advocates , by contrast , said the court was infringing on a longstanding principle that arbitration agreements must allow effective vindication of rights . the upshot of that is that companies like american###express can use these forced arbitration clauses to give themselves immunity from federal###laws , said f . paul bland jr . of public justice , a nonprofit consumer advocacy###group . the case , american###express###company v . italian colors restaurant , began when the merchants sued american###express over the fees they were required to pay each time a customer charged a purchase . american###express is a dominant provider of the charge cards that are favored by many corporations and affluent individuals . businesses wishing to accept those cards must also agree to accept american###express credit###cards , which are less popular . and american###express charges the merchants higher###fees on each credit###card transaction than visa or mastercard . ( charge###card transactions must be paid in full each month credit###cards allow customers to carry a balance . ) the merchants argued that american###express was violating antitrust laws . their contracts required such claims to be submitted to individual arbitration , but the merchants argued that the potential winnings were too small to justify the cost of mounting individual antitrust cases . they sought judicial approval to pursue the claim as a class###action . the united###states court of appeals for the second circuit ruled in their favor . in overturning that decision , justice###scalia wrote that the individual arbitration requirement was not a barrier to pursuing claims , but a limitation on the terms of pursuit . he cited high filing###fees as an example of the kind of requirement that , by contrast , might not be allowed . justice elena###kagan , writing for the three dissenters , said the effect was the same . if the arbitration###clause is enforceable , amex has insulated itself from antitrust liability even if it has in fact violated the law , she wrote . the monopolist gets to use its monopoly power to insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all legal###recourse . she summarized the majority 's response as too darn bad . justice sonia###sotomayor , who was a member of the court of appeals when it ruled on the case , did not participate in the supreme###court decision .
st . louis matt###holliday 's two###run###home###run in the sixth###inning stunned wily peralta with the st . louis###cardinals' first hit and rookie shelby###miller blanked the milwaukee###brewers into the seventh###inning of a###4 2 victory tuesday###night . norichika aoki of the brewers struck out three times for the first time in the majors , the last against rookie lefty kevin siegrist with a runner on second to end the seventh . aoki entered the game as the toughest batter to fan in the majors this year , averaging one per . 2 at bats . matt carpenter and matt###adams added rbis in the seventh and eighth for the nl central leaders , who are 4 0 to begin a nine game###homestand . after a day off , the cardinals built on momentum from a three game sweep of pittsburgh . the 22 year old miller ( 13 9 ) emphasized more off speed deliveries to keep the pitch###count down and allowed five hits with four strikeouts and two walks in 6 2 3 innings . he 's 3 0 with a . 08 era in four starts against milwaukee , the other two wins coming on the road . peralta ( 9 15 ) was significantly###improved over his first two starts against the cardinals , both in may , in which he allowed 12 runs and 22 hits in 9 1 3 innings . in 6 2 3 innings he was charged with three runs and three hits with seven strikeouts . the brewers avoided getting shut out for a third time by st . louis on pinch###hitter logan schafer 's two run homer off edward###mujica in the ninth . peralta struck out five of the first seven hitters and the cardinals had two baserunners the first five innings a walk by holliday in the fourth and first baseman jonathan###lucroy 's error on a dropped throw in the third . aoki kept the no###hitter going with a sliding catch down the right field line that robbed david###freese of a hit opening the fifth . holliday fouled balls off his left###foot or ankle three times the first two at bats , near where he 's wearing a guard from previous occurrences . carpenter walked to open the sixth and holliday saw just one pitch his third time against peralta , hammering a fastball an estimated 424 feet to left center for his 19th homer . siegrist , a 41 st round###draft###pick , has worked 18 consecutive###scoreless###innings and has held left###handed###hitters to just four hits in 53 at bats . rookie scooter gennett of milwaukee had two hits and is batting . 394brett hull chucked a side armed ceremonial first pitch , a day after the hockey hall of famer rejoined the st . louis###blues as an executive###vice###president . notes cardinals manager mike###matheny said there was no timetable or any better guesstimate on when allen###craig might return from a sprained left###foot . craig is batting . 396 against milwaukee with two homers and 10 rbis . ... brewers manager ron###roenicke picked the cardinals to prevail in the central because they 're probably the most well rounded team , and also thought all three teams would be contenders for years to come . and that 's a tough thing for us , he said . you do n't have all these veterans who are going to be free###agents and they 're going to be losing all these guys . ... the brewers played the first of 20 straight days , the maximum allowed in the collective###bargaining###agreement , to end the season . they 'll use a six man rotation the rest of the year , getting an extended look at youngsters tyler thornburg and johnny hellweg , the pcl pitcher of the year at triple a nashville , and give extra###days off to the rest of the rotation .
despite all the fear and anxiety , netflix did n't steal the night in the end . modern###family on abc won the emmy for best comedy , which was almost a surprise because it has won so many times before and because other shows , like veep of hbo , have gained###ground . breaking###bad , on the other hand , is about to end its run , so it was almost inevitable that that amc hit would get yet another standing###ovation . many other wins were unexpected , and some were well deserved like jeff###daniels , who won the award for best actor in a drama for the newsroom on hbo , and merritt###wever , of nurse###jackie on showtime , who won the award for best supporting###actress in a comedy . ms . wever proved she deserved her statuette , giving the shortest and best acceptance###speech . she thanked the academy , then said , i gotta go , bye , and walked offstage . if it 's a new and golden###age###of###television , as so many presenters insisted , you could n't tell from the host , neil###patrick###harris , who treated the emmys like the tonys and made self conscious jokes about the precariousness and even irrelevance of classic television in the era of on demand premium cable and internet streaming . mr . harris said that the awards show would celebrate the best of television , then added , for our younger###audience , that 's the thing you watch on your phones . in a night that could have celebrated the many exciting innovations in the field , the emmy producers chose to look backward , not only with tributes to dead actors but also with mournful references to a more glorious time in broadcast television , particularly on cbs , which presented the event . that network put its chief###executive , leslie###moonves , in a coy cameo in the opening skit , and it stretched a link between the anniversary of the cbs anchorman walter###cronkite 's coverage of the kennedy###assassination and the beatles' first performance on the ed###sullivan show also on cbs so that carrie###underwood could sing yesterday . cbs executives seem so worried about their own mortality that they 're celebrating their own mortality . insecurity may also be the reason the show kept veering into song and dance###routines that have no bearing on the emmys . mr . harris , a frequent awards show host , was mocked in a fake ad in which his how i met your mother co stars warned about the risks of excessive hosting disorder . but it was the show itself that needed an intervention , shifting from awards to musical###numbers better suited to the tonys and the grammys awards show identity###disorder . mr . harris did two song and dance numbers , including one that paid###tribute to mad###men with a tune from guys###and###dolls . the other made fun of its own irrelevance to the moment at hand it 's the number in the middle of the show . that was a lot of time wasted on a night when there were so many deaths to acknowledge , including those of cory###monteith of glee and james###gandolfini of the sopranos . even stars who did n't###die this past year got a shout out . michael###douglas 's award for best actor in a movie or mini###series was one of three that behind the candelabra , an hbo biopic of liberace , won that night . ( mr . douglas thanked his co star , matt###damon , who played his younger lover , and said he would split the statuette with him , adding roguishly , you want the bottom or the top ? ) with that many awards , it was n't clear why elton###john needed to sing a solemn song from his new album that had nothing to do with that vegas showman , but it certainly was n't much of an homage to play on an unadorned piano with no candelabra in the wind . fashion , always a side benefit of an awards show , was n't much more innovative or exciting . there is so much change in the industry and so little experimentation in wardrobe choices year after year actresses , or rather their stylists , select tasteful , risk free monochromatic , strapless gowns by valentino , prada or zac###posen . hollywood is still so haunted by the over the top fashion faux###pas of cher or bj###rk that even comedy stars abide by the sartorial equivalent of the hippocratic###oath first do no fashion harm . and that made lena###dunham 's choice of a bold , full skirted , green ball###gown covered with red###roses seem more shocking than her near nudity on girls . the real winner of the night may have been cynicism and distrust of government . seven or eight days away from a possible government###shutdown , some of the winners , like veep , homeland and political animals , reflect television 's repulsed but riveted relationship with washington . the federal###government may be a swamp , but it 's a swamp viewers love to splash in . compared with the waste and gridlock on sunday 's emmy###awards show , washington may be a lot more functional .
to enter the sand colored building , most people schoolchildren on field###trips , out of state tourists must wait in line to pass through a security area outfitted with metal###detectors and scanners . but those with state licenses to carry###concealed firearms can enter in a matter of seconds . they simply hand their permit to a state###trooper , who verifies its authenticity . no metal###detector needed . just as texas has long embraced its guns , so has the capitol . legislators have walked the terrazzo hallways , attended committee###hearings , met with constituents in their offices and voted on the floors of their respective chambers while armed with licensed high powered pistols tucked beneath their suits or slipped into their boots or purses . despite the widespread###acceptance of concealed###weapons , many lawmakers do not speak so freely about their weaponry . discretion is a key###element of the capitol 's gun culture one reason those with licenses were given a separate security lane was to avoid having them take out their guns before passing through the metal###detectors . but of the 181 members of the state house and senate , dozens have concealed###carry permits and routinely have their weapons with them in the building , current and former lawmakers said . jerry patterson , the state land commissioner and a former senator who wrote the concealed handgun law , put the number at around 35 legislators . others said mr . patterson 's estimate was too high , and others , including alice tripp , legislative director of the texas state rifle association , the state affiliate of the national###rifle###association , said it was too low . i 'd say half the house and half the senate , she said . there 's a couple who , i used to say , their desks would qualify as a gun show . at recent hearings of the house committee on county affairs , representative jonathan stickland sat listening to testimony while wearing a . 40 caliber semiautomatic pistol . this is probably one of the most well armed buildings in the state , said mr . stickland , a freshman republican from bedford , near fort###worth . when you grow up around guns and you feel###comfortable with what they can do , and you know how to use them and you respect them , there 's really nothing to fear . anyone trying to understand why the gun debate has played out differently in texas should visit the 124 year old center of state government . the normalcy of firearms in the capitol the ease with which those with concealed handguns enter the building , and legislators' habit of wearing their weapons in their offices or on the house or senate floor reflects the normal nature of firearms throughout texas . the recent rush of bills seeking to expand and promote gun rights in the state allowing concealed firearms on college###campuses , making texas independence day on march 2 a tax free holiday for gun###purchases were fine###tuned by armed staff members and filed by armed legislators as armed texans strolled the halls . when metal###detectors were temporarily installed outside the third floor galleries of the house and senate chambers a few years###ago , one lobbyist recalled that some house members used their offices as gun checks where constituents could store their weapons and pick them up later . when gov . rick###perry gave his state of the state speech in february 2011 in the house chamber , he stood a short###distance from representative chuck hopson , who paid close###attention with a . 22 caliber five shot revolver in his right boot and a . 357 magnum within arm 's reach in a drawer of his desk . many texas lawmakers were some of the first to undergo criminal###background###checks and complete hours of training to receive a concealed handgun permit after the state law passed in . they described carrying###weapons in the capitol as a personal###security habit , doing what they did elsewhere in the state , whether shopping , dining , praying or driving . they also wear their weapons , they said , for the same reason they keep jacks in their vehicles and fresh batteries in their smoke###detectors at home . they said there was a difference between being paranoid and being prepared .
austin , texas in oil rich parts of texas , hydraulic###fracturing has almost become a way of life . drilling###rigs and pumping###equipment pepper the landscape , and enormous trucks carrying oil###field supplies rumble down narrow , dusty roads . in europe , things could hardly be more different . opposition to hydraulic###fracturing the process of injecting water , sand and chemicals into the earth to blast apart rock and retrieve oil or natural###gas is widespread and entrenched . some countries , including france , ban the practice , which is also known as fracking . there is a head of steam up against fracking , said jonathan stern , chairman of the natural###gas research program at the oxford###institute###for###energy###studies in england . in germany , beer brewers recently urged a ban on fracking , citing###concerns about groundwater###contamination , according to the newspaper bild . europe 's opposition is being put to the test , however , as pro fracking forces lobby for exploring underground shale###gas reserves . they argue that locally drilled natural###gas can create###jobs and increase energy###security a potent argument for a continent uncomfortably reliant on natural###gas from russia . last week , a group of british business###leaders , the institute of directors , put out a report saying that developing shale###gas reserves could lead to tens###of###thousands of jobs . shale###gas could be a new north###sea for britain , corin taylor , the report 's author , said in a statement accompanying its release . mr . stern noted that fracking is a long way from happening on a major###scale in europe , and some early results have not been promising . several major international###companies have scaled back their work in poland after operations proved###disappointing . even so , some countries are lifting their moratoriums on fracking in the hope of good results . britain did so in december , though the prospect of exploratory###drilling has brought protests . romania also recently lifted its moratorium , and the gas rich netherlands will decide soon about whether to do the same . dutch politicians are awaiting the results of an independent study on shale###gas that is due to be released this summer . then the country will re evaluate its moratorium , according to bart visser , a spokesman for the minister###of###economic###affairs . the study is about whether or not to allow test drilling in shale rock , coby van###der###linde , director of the clingendael international energy program in the hague , said in an e mail . it will also determine the conditions under which the shale###gas could be produced , she said . at least one key political group is on the fence , according to ms . van###der###linde . and the dutch pro###environment party groenlinks is firmly opposed to fracking . whether or not it is an independent inquiry remains to be seen , said liesbeth van###tongeren , a member of parliament and spokeswoman for groenlinks on energy issues . she expressed###concerns about water , truck traffic and fracking 's effect on the climate . groups with dollar signs in their eyes are promoting fracking , she said . some guidance on fracking may also be forthcoming on the european###union level . by the end of the year , the european###commission will craft a shale###gas initiative that could lead to a risk###management strategy for fracking . a meeting in brussels is being held on this issue next week . as europe makes its decisions on fracking , some are looking to the united###states for ideas about the regulation of fracking . each state in the united###states generally has its own approach , slightly different from the others , and national regulations , applying to federally###owned lands , are still being formulated . john tintera , former executive###director of the railroad###commission###of###texas , the curiously named agency that regulates drilling in the leading oil producing state , said he had been to romania twice already to discuss fracking , and would soon go to ukraine and perhaps turkey . when talking to europeans , the first thing they want to know is , can hydro fracturing be done safely ? said mr . tintera , who is now a partner at sebree tintera , an energy consulting###firm based in texas . the second thing they want to know is , how do you ensure that ? the answers , mr . tintera said , are that fracking can be done safely and that a comprehensive regulatory###framework is necessary . such regulation includes boots in the field , or trained inspectors , he said . mr . stern , of the oxford###institute###for###energy###studies , said that europe had massively overhyped both the downsides and the upsides of fracking and shale###gas exploration . europeans hold a bifurcated view of what has happened in the united###states , he said some europeans admire the u.s . fracking successes and believe that europe should follow its example , perhaps with additional caution . in others' minds , fracking in the united###states has all been a big disaster . asked to predict the future of fracking in europe , mr . stern forecast that in five years' time , a few countries would be producing very modest amounts of shale###gas . those countries might be poland , britain and perhaps romania or bulgaria . but if there are any environmental###problems , the whole thing will stop and not restart , he said .
ardmore , pennsylvania merion###golf###club has been linked with some of the most iconic moments in championship golf and tiger###woods will aim to add a chapter of his own at this week 's u.s . open where he is a heavy favorite . a host of other players can lay claim to being genuine contenders for the year 's second major , which begins on thursday , but woods is widely###viewed as the likeliest winner based on his outstanding record and the often dominant form he has shown this season . though woods did not fare well in his most recent start , languishing joint 65th in a field of 73 at the memorial###tournament 10 days###ago , he has triumphed four times on the 2013 pga###tour and is clearly the player to beat at merion . tiger###woods is playing some awesome golf , fellow american matt###kuchar , who won the memorial title to give himself a significant boost for this week , told###reporters on wednesday . winning four times already is just amazing . he seems to be back clicking again and when he 's on , he can do things that most of the rest of us ca n't do . it 's fun to have him playing well . but the great###thing about the game of golf , anybody who tees it up has a chance to win . every field we play on the pga###tour , the top to bottom , there 's a lot of strength . woods has revived memories of his glory###days in the late 1990s and early 2000s with much of his play this year and he will be eager to end a major title drought dating back to his playoff###victory at the 2008 u.s . open . though the american world number one was bitterly###disappointed with his overall game at the memorial###tournament , and especially his putting , he has put that down as a blip in an otherwise successful###season . i did n't really do much that i was real pleased about , but it was just one of those weeks , 14 times major champion woods said . it happens . and move on from there . i had a good week of practice last week at home . we had a tropical###storm roll through there , i guess it was getting us ready for this one . bad###weather has already been a huge factor at merion with more than six inches ( 15cm ) of rain saturating the area since friday and severe###thunderstorms have been forecast for the latter part of thursday 's opening round . you 're not going to see a firm u.s . open this year , said twice former u.s . open###champion ernie###els . we 're going to have a soft golf course ... all week . it means that if you 're on your game you 're going to have a lot of birdie putts . there are quite a few par fours where you 've just got to put it in the fairway ... then you 've got quite a short second shot . i 'm not going to say anybody is going to shoot a 62 at a u.s . open , but you 've got more birdie opportunities than ever . merion 's iconic east course will be hosting its fifth u.s . open this week , but its first in 32 years after long being regarded as too short to host a major . the par 70 layout located in the philadelphia suburb of ardmore has been stretched to , 996 yards since australian david graham triumphed by three strokes in the 1981 edition , and woods appreciates that precise shot making is required for success . this is a course , after all , where bobby###jones completed his grand###slam by winning the 1930 u.s . amateur , where ben###hogan claimed the 1950 u.s . open just 16 months after being involved in a near fatal motor###vehicle###accident and where lee###trevino beat jack###nicklaus in a playoff to win the 1971 u.s . open . if you look at the list of champions , they have all been really good shot makers , said three times u.s . open###champion woods . they have all been able to shape the golf###ball . that 's what it lends itself to . you have to be able to shape the golf###ball , and you have to be so disciplined to play the course . as ever at a u.s . open , the ability to minimize errors and to stay patient on contoured greens and tight fairways flanked by thick , graduated rough will be defining traits in the make up of this week 's champion . the list of potential winners is long and includes masters champion adam scott of australia , englishmen justin###rose and luke donald , 2010 winner graeme###mcdowell of northern###ireland and former masters champion zach###johnson , who is known for his brilliant wedge game . northern###irish world number two rory###mcilroy , the 2011 u.s . open###champion at congressional , is another likely contender as he bids to claim his first tournament victory this season after winning five times worldwide last year .

los###angeles ( ap ) the face of mars is dotted with a maze of channels , pointing to possible ancient megaflood episodes . now scientists peering below the surface have uncovered the first evidence of underground channels apparently created by flooding a finding that 's expected to further illuminate the role of water in mars' history . using a ground piercing radar sensor aboard the mars###reconnaissance###orbiter , a team of scientists created 3 d maps of an equatorial region known as elysium planitia and the channels that run###underneath the plains . besides the contributions from rovers and landers , our view of the red###planet has largely been restricted to looking at the surface from orbiting###spacecraft , said lead###researcher gareth morgan , a planetary###scientist at the smithsonian###institution . the research , published###online thursday in the journal science , offers a new perspective below the martian surface and hints of past flooding at a time when the planet was mostly thought to be cold and desert like . the channels remained###hidden because the once volcanically###active region had been filled in by lava flows hundreds of millions years###ago . dry channels on the martian surface were first spied by mariner 9 in . later observations by the viking spacecraft suggested the geologic features were likely carved by water . mars missions since then have used sophisticated instruments to image these winding channels . the latest 3 d maps , painstakingly pieced###together from radar data collected by numerous spacecraft passes , have already changed scientists' notions the channels are deeper than expected , a sign that flooding was more extensive than generally###believed . morgan said the origin of the ancient floodwaters likely came from a deep reservoir and were possibly unleashed by a volcanic###eruption . brown###university mars expert john mustard called the new work totally cool and significant . it shows a completely new dimension for considering the evolution of mars , mustard , who was not part of the study , said in an email .
plainfield , mass . on a recent sunny###afternoon , matt###haimovitz entered a carpentry workshop here that doubles as a music studio and gently pulled the door shut . the garden of the 19th century farmhouse echoed with the shouts of children . but the newest family member was quietly leaning against the wall . it was darker than its sibling next to it and covered in pockmarks , but mr . haimovitz cupped his hand around its neck with loving pride this is my beethoven cello . mr . haimovitz is one of the leading cellists of his generation and equally well known for his ardent interpretations of the classics as for boundary pushing projects involving electronics and collaborations with unusual###instruments . for 25 years , he has played a spectacular goffriller cello made in 1710 that has a rich , golden sound . but this summer , he trawled auction sites in search of a second instrument , settling on an anonymous bohemian cello from around 1770 with generously sized f holes and a 19th century tailpiece . fitted with gut###strings tuned to a lower beethoven era a of 430 hz , this is the instrument mr . haimovitz will use on sept . 10 for a performance of the complete beethoven sonatas , with christopher###o'riley on fortepiano , at the international beethoven project 's love 2013 festival in chicago . mr . haimovitz and mr . o'riley last collaborated on a recording and concert tour titled shuffle . play . listen that tossed together music by stravinsky and janacek , radiohead and arcade fire . the most popular###youtube video of mr . haimovitz is of his bow shredding solo cello transcription of jimi###hendrix 's star###spangled###banner . so why is mr . haimovitz 's conversation now peppered with the kind of period details that normally consume early###music specialists ? plucking a string , he marveled at the rich resonance that lingered for several seconds . i love shifting on these strings , he enthused as he ran his finger up the yellow###brown strings , which he imports from a string maker in italy . its workshop , he said , is next to a slaughterhouse so that the sheep gut is processed fresh , without the need for preservatives . if you can control those slides , you can get all kinds of vivid portamenti , he said referring to the left###hand shifts that , when audible , can become an expressive part of a melody . on the steel strings , the vibrato kicks in much more , because it takes more work to get the string down on the fingerboard , and you 're sustaining more on the bow . with the gut###strings , you have to let it breathe and resonate . mr . haimovitz is part of a growing number of string players who are experimenting with period###instruments , even though they are not part of the early###music scene . it 's a quiet revolt against the trench wars of previous###decades , when a player had to take sides on one hand , the unreformed mainstream , playing on steel strings with modern bow on the other , the birkenstock wearing early###music movement with its baroque bows , gut###strings and archaic tuning###systems . to some , those boundaries are still real , and hotly###debated . the british violinist nigel###kennedy caused a stir this summer when he laced his program###notes for a bach recital with barbs against the so called authentic movement that he said had pushed bach into a ghetto . but in the united###states , a growing number of musicians are drawn to the heightened expressive potential of period###instruments . for centuries , instrument###makers , players and composers formed a kind of circular bio system in which technological advances and stylistic developments fed off one another . but as musicians today learn to master a repertory spanning four centuries , questions of performance###practice and instrument choice become vital and demand to be addressed anew with each concert . on sept . 1 , johnny gandelsman will present a recital of works for solo###violin at the ravinia###festival in illinois , including works by biber , philip###glass and bach 's partita in d with its profoundly melancholic chaconne . in february , mr . gandelsman performed that chaconne at the helicon foundation in new york using for the first time a baroque bow . one of the foundation 's missions is to allow musicians to try out familiar repertory with unfamiliar period###instruments . it was as if the bow was telling me how to play the music , said mr . gandelsman , who plays with the string###quartet brooklyn rider as well as with the silk###road ensemble . for years , i was experimenting with my bow hold . all that time , i was searching for something lighter , more dancey . he found it in the gentle convex curve of the baroque bow the modern bow is longer , and slightly###concave . the greater resonance of the gut###strings also makes it easier to reveal the lower voices in bach 's contrapuntal writing , he said , adding i spend a lot of my time as a musician trying things i have not been officially trained to do , whether it 's improvisation , fiddling and now , occasionally , baroque###violin . i do it because i love the music , and i want to understand how it works .
when she was , cheri huber considered her skin splotchy and pasty . she began going to a tanning salon about three times a week . there were tanning businesses everywhere , said ms . huber , now 41 and living in kingwood , a houston suburb . i said , 'this must be cool to do because everybody 's doing it . ' ms . huber continued her tanning regimen for more than a decade , eventually buying a tanning###bed . in , she was treated for melanoma and has been in recovery for almost five years . i wish i was a little more educated , ms . huber said about her tanning routine . soon , texas will join a number of states that bar minors from tanning indoors , which experts say greatly###increases the risk of melanoma in those under . senate bill , written by state###senators joan huffman , republican of southside place , and sylvia r . garcia , democrat of houston , automatically became law in june without the governor 's signature and will take effect on sunday . it will overturn a law allowing certain minors those between 16 and 18 to tan with parental###consent . businesses will also be required to keep customer records for three years after a customer 's most recent###visit . you have to take steps to make sure you provide for the public safety , ms . garcia said . drinking , smoking there are a number of other areas where you want to make sure people know the potential health###risks , and i think that is a good reason for us to step in . dr . jeffrey e . gershenwald , the medical director of the melanoma and skin center at the university###of###texas###md###anderson###cancer###center in houston , said there was clear###evidence that using a tanning###bed increased the risk of melanoma . melanoma develops when skin cells are damaged by ultraviolet###radiation and turn into malignant###tumors . it is treatable in early###stages but can be deadly if it spreads . those who use indoor tanning salons before turning 18 increase their risk of melanoma by 85 percent , dr . gershenwald said . the challenge is when melanoma develops it can be completely without any symptoms . the ban has the support of the texas dermatological society and the texas medical###association , but business###owners say the government has no place telling people what to do . joseph levy , a scientific###adviser to the american suntanning association , said the law would force businesses to close and lead to unsupervised tanning , which could increase sunburns and , subsequently , skin###cancer . mr . levy said the scientific###evidence linking melanoma to tanning beds was misleading because researchers often included tanning beds used in homes and doctors' offices in addition to those at salons . zach medlin , who owns aruba tan in austin , said most of his clients are college students . he said that the ban would not immediately affect his business , but that it would have an impact on him in the long run because there would be fewer tanners . they 're going to know it 's been illegal since they were under , mr . medlin said , and think , 'it 's really bad for me .

san###antonio mike budenholzer has observed the san###antonio###spurs ' success from many vantage###points during his 19 years with the team from the video room , where he landed his first job with the spurs , to the bench , where he now sits next to coach gregg###popovich . budenholzer has been popovich 's top assistant for six years . but when the n.b.a . finals conclude , he will become the coach of the atlanta###hawks , the latest in a long line of spurs assistants to graduate to bigger assignments elsewhere . the n.b.a . is full of disciples of popovich and general###manager r . c . buford , who represent stability and success , with four championships in the last 15 seasons and a fifth within reach . it makes###sense that other clubs would be impressed by people who have employment with the spurs listed on their r sum s . danny###ferry , the hawks' new general###manager , who is giving budenholzer his first head###coaching job , was once the director###of###basketball###operations for san###antonio . one of budenholzer 's first decisions after accepting the atlanta job was to hire quin###snyder , who coached the spurs' development###league team for three years , to be one of his assistants . mike###brown , the newly rehired cleveland###cavaliers coach , and jacque###vaughn , the orlando###magic coach , were san###antonio assistants under popovich . so was p . j . carlesimo , the interim###coach for the nets this season . new orleans pelicans coach monty###williams played three years with san###antonio and was an intern during the 2004 5 season , when the spurs won a title . avery###johnson , a former coach of the dallas###mavericks and the nets , and vinny###del###negro , recently dismissed as coach of the los###angeles###clippers , played for popovich . examples abound in team front offices , too . sam presti ( oklahoma###city###thunder , dell demps ( new orleans ) and kevin###pritchard ( indiana###pacers ) are general###managers who , like ferry , once worked under buford . the success we 've had on the court in the playoffs is great , budenholzer said , but where pop and i , and all of us , get just as big of a kick is watching people go out and be successful . we love it . when it comes to launching careers , the spurs have had more success than other recent champions , like the los###angeles###lakers , the boston###celtics , the mavericks and the miami###heat . what makes the spurs stand out , some former assistants say , is that popovich and buford do a precise job of including everyone in the team 's decision###making . when discussing the draft , game strategy or a trade , for example , popovich and buford will bring together almost every member of the staff in a room , budenholzer said . everyone then debates the issue at stake . the format allows the coaching###staff to learn as much about the salary###cap and the league 's luxury tax rules as the front office learns about team chemistry and player development . pop is amazing about listening to everybody , budenholzer said . most of the time , the spurs make the right decision and budenholzer said that popovich and buford were fine if it did not come from them . in fact , budenholzer said , they are not pleased when assistants do not give an opinion . when you 're asked to think of ideas and new ways , and the best idea wins , it makes the whole group better , ferry said . in , it was budenholzer 's idea for the spurs to trade george hill , a backup point###guard popovich loved , for kawhi###leonard , who is now guarding lebron###james in the finals . he 's a really good coach and he 's smart because he 's been asked to think , ferry said of budenholzer , his new hire . salary###cap questions , timeout questions and player development situations have been part of the things he has to think about . because spurs assistants are directly###involved in decision###making , they tend to have a full grasp of what it takes to win when they meet owners who are looking to hire coaches , ferry said . ferry said that popovich and buford were humble enough to know that they could both be digging ditches if not for tim###duncan , their cornerstone on the court since he joined the spurs as the no . 1 pick in the 1997 draft . popovich and buford joined the spurs as assistants under larry###brown in 1988 and left after a coaching purge in . popovich returned in 1994 as the team 's general###manager and vice###president for basketball operations , and he brought back buford as the head scout . popovich became san###antonio 's coach in , and buford took over as general###manager in . together , they have taken a disciplined approach in keeping the spurs consistently competitive . operating under the restrictions of a small###market team , they try to make smart draft moves , aggressively look overseas for talent nine of the current players are from outside the mainland united###states and avoid contracts that would force the team to pay the league 's luxury tax . in atlanta , budenholzer and ferry will have plenty of decisions to discuss this summer . more than half of the hawks' starting###lineup from last year , including josh###smith , the team 's best player , will be free###agents . carlesimo , now an analyst###for###espn , said he knew it was difficult for budenholzer to leave the spurs . when carlesimo joined san###antonio in , he had been a head###coach with the portland###trail###blazers and the golden###state###warriors . but he spent five years with the spurs , and he said he did not regret any of it . good people will stay here because the feeling is , even if you 're making a little bit less , you 're learning , you 're part of a really good organization and you 're probably going to get something if you pay your dues , carlesimo said . people want to hire spurs assistants . people want to be spurs assistants , too . ime###udoka is the newest assistant on popovich 's staff . udoka played three years for san###antonio and showed an interest in coaching . when the spurs had an opening on their staff , udoka retired , moved from spain to san###antonio and began###providing input to popovich , buford and budenholzer . this was a great###opportunity i could n't pass up , udoka said . i definitely know how

allosaurus , a smaller cousin of tyrannosaurus###rex , was a dexterous hunter that tugged at prey like a modern day falcon , showing far more sophisticated table###manners than t . rex , researchers are reporting . while t . rex was like an angry gorilla with an ice###pick , allosaurus was like a surgeon with a scalpel , said eric snively , a mechanical###engineer at ohio###university and an author of a new study on the smaller dinosaur , published in the journal palaeontologia electronica . the study was based on 150 million year old bones . using a ct###scanner and a method called multibody dynamics , developed originally for robotics , the researchers modeled allosaurus 's neck and jaw###muscles and simulated its muscle movement . the skull is loaded with scars where muscles attach , and we were able to reconstruct the dinosaur by making###comparisons to modern day birds , said another author , lawrence m . witmer , a paleontologist at ohio . though more than 20 feet long and twice as heavy as a polar###bear , allosaurus probably drove its teeth downward into its prey . like such small falcons as the american###kestrel , it held its head steady and then pulled flesh up t . rex , by contrast , used more of a side to side thrashing action . ( dr . snively has also studied t . rex 's mechanics . ) the study is part of the visible interactive dinosaur project , financed by the national###science###foundation , whose goal is fleshing out dinosaur skeletons .
santa###monica , calif . the gunman whose rampage across this city on friday left four people dead before he was killed by the police at santa###monica###college carried a vast arsenal with him , including a semiautomatic rifle , a handgun , a tactical vest and , 300 rounds of ammunition , the police said saturday . the size of the cache indicated he might have been planning a much larger attack than he was able to carry out . the police here displayed some of the contents of the black###bag the gunman was carrying with him , including part of a rifle , an upper receiver dozens of magazines and an older revolver . he heavily###armed himself and he was ready for battle , said sgt . richard###lewis of the santa###monica police departmentofficials said the killer fired at least 70 rounds inside the santa###monica###college library shortly before he was killed in an encounter with the police . jacqueline seabrooks , the santa###monica police###chief , said he could easily have fired many more , given the arms he was carrying . thirteen hundred rounds could have been fired had the suspect not been neutralized , she said . the police did not release the identity of the gunman because his next of kin had not been notified of his death , but said that he had a personal###connection to the house where the violence began . that house , on yorkshire avenue , in an inland section of this seaside city , is owned by samir zawahri , 55 , records show . the los###angeles###times identified the gunman , who the police said would have turned 24 years old on saturday , as john zawahri . while much of his violent spree appeared random the police said the gunman was shooting indiscriminately on the streets of santa###monica he also had a connection to the college where it ended . he and a family member had been enrolled at santa###monica###college as recently as , the police said . firefighters who responded to 911 calls at the yorkshire avenue house just before noon on friday found two bodies in a back room . the police said they had been called to the house in an episode involving the gunman in , but were unable to release details because he was a minor at the time . the entire bloody spree took only 13 minutes , from the time police received those first 911 calls until the gunman was killed inside the library . outside the burning house , he shot at a passing###car on the street , hitting one woman , who was wounded , but expected to survive . he carjacked another passing###car , directing the frightened driver turn by turn toward the college , and stopping along the way to get out of the car and shoot , the police said . he told her to drive at gunpoint , told her where to stop , told her he would kill her , chief seabrooks said . she was obviously terrified . at one intersection on the way to the college , the shooter fired indiscriminately , chief seabrooks said , hitting a passing bus . at least two passengers sustained###minor wounds . at another intersection at the entrance to the college campus , he fired at a red ford###explorer , killing the driver , carlos###franco , an employee at santa###monica###college . the passenger in vehicle remained gravely###wounded in the hospital on saturday . the gunman then entered the campus on foot , where he killed a woman outside the library , before entering the building . once inside , he targeted still more victims firing at least 70 rounds and shooting at students who had barricaded themselves inside a room before two santa###monica police###officers and one santa###monica###college officer ended his killing spree . chief seabrooks said that the police had not settled on a motive for the attack , but said it clearly had been planned . i would presume any time someone puts on a vest of some sort , comes out with a bag full of loaded magazines , has an extra receiver , a handgun and a semiautomatic rifle , carjacks folks , goes to a college , kills more people and has to be neutralized , she said , i would say that 's premeditated .
montreal wimbledon champion andy###murray tumbled out of the rogers###cup on thursday , falling , 6 3 to lavia 's ernests###gulbis in the third round . the second seeded murray , a two time rogers###cup champion , was playing his second match since his wimbledon victory . the loss ended the scot 's winning###streak at 13 matches . i looked on this monitor that i lost to him five times , but honestly i just remember the last match we played in cincinnati , gulbis said . it was a really tough match , but it was in . it was a really long time ago . i was a different person , he was a different player . top seeded defending###champion novak###djokovic avoided an upset in the last match , rallying to beat uzbekistan 's denis###istomin , 6 4 , 6 4 . djokovic will face seventh###seeded richard###gasquet of france , a , 6 3 , 6 3 winner over ninth###seeded kei###nishikori of japan . nadal , the fourth###seeded spanish star making his first tournament appearance since losing in the first round at wimbledon , improved his atp tour leading record to 45 3 including 7 0 on hardcourts . i had a very good victory today against a very difficult opponent , nadal said about the 6 foot 8 janowicz . i did a few things well during the match , a few things that i need to improve a little bit more . his serve is huge . his forehand and backhand can be very dangerous . when he plays with a little bit of regular shots , he will become a very difficult player to beat . if he is able to maintain the right level during whole match he will be a player that will be in the very top positions . the rogers cup###winner in 2005 and , nadal will face australia 's marinko matosevic , a , 6 7 ( 10 ) , 6 3 winner over france 's benoit paire . canadians milos###raonic and vasek###pospisil advanced , the first time two canadians have reached the quarterfinals in the event since andrew sznejder and grant###connell in . raonic , seeded 11th , upset sixth###seeded juan###martin del potro , the argentine player coming off a tournament victory sunday in washington , 7 5 , 6 4 . del potro was upset that raonic got away with touching the net with his hand on break###point in the eighth game of the second set . very upset after the match i lost , del portro tweeted . about the end . .. i think everyone saw what happened . raonic said it was too important of a point to call a foul on himself . i was fortunate that the line judge did n't see it , he said . it 's a lucky thing for me in my sense , unlucky for him . something that can go really both ways . it 's the exact same thing as having no challenges left and you get a bad line call . it 's bad###luck . it was hard to be able to take this point on such a big point . pospisil beat fifth seeded tomas berdych of the czech###republic , 2 6 , 7 6 ( 5 ) for his first victory over an opponent ranked in the top . that was the best match in terms of atmosphere at the end that i 've ever played , pospisil said . that and the doubles in davis###cup ( a win over italy this year ) were pretty even in terms of atmosphere . they were both amazing . but that was definitely the most emotional ending and best match of my career , without a doubt . on friday , pospisil will face nikolay###davydenko , who downed fellow russian alex bogomolov jr . 6 4 , 6 3 . if i can keep playing the way i am now , at least i 'll give myself an opportunity , pospisil said .
madrid the spanish###government decreed on friday that the country 's utilities could charge consumers only . 3 percent more for their electricity next month after accusing utilities of manipulating a recent auction to win a price increase of 11 percent . while meant as a good will gesture to consumers , the government 's unparalleled intervention underlines the fragile regulations of spain 's electricity###market and the conflicting###interests driving its energy###policy . on the one hand , the government is concerned about forcing people to pay significantly more for electricity at a time when spain has barely emerged from a two year recession and is still struggling with unemployment of 26 percent and a credit squeeze . on the other hand , prime###minister mariano###rajoy is committed to trimming spain 's ballooning energy deficit as part of broader efforts to clean up the country 's finances . the energy deficit the accumulated shortfall between the cost of power###generation in spain and what regulated rates bring in from consumers has reached more than 26 billion###euros ( about 36 billion . for , the government had targeted a full year deficit of . 6 billion . instead , the shortfall reached . 5 billion for the period to october . mr . rajoy said at a news conference that containing energy costs was the most complicated issue his administration had faced since taking###office two years###ago . he said the decision on friday was a transitory mechanism that would be replaced in the second quarter by a new and definitive mechanism for auctioning electricity . it has been a decade of troubles in the spanish energy system , but the situation has now reached a critical###point , said fabien roques , an energy consultant in paris with compass lexecon . spain needs urgently to move away from ad###hoc changes to a reliable system in which prices reflect costs and in which investors can also regain confidence . alfredo p rez rubalcaba , the leader of the main opposition socialist###party , said at a separate news conference , i prefer a rise of . 3 percent to 11 percent , but we still need to know what happened in this auction . he added if there was manipulation , this should end up in court . the government and spain 's electricity companies have been at loggerheads since the auction last week . to the utilities' dismay , the auction result was annulled , with jos###manuel soria , the industry minister , further angering the sector by suggesting auction participants had engaged in a crude manipulation in order to modify prices . responding to the accusations , unesa , the association representing spain 's electricity companies , said in a statement last weekend that serious damage is being done to the reputation and economies of companies that perform a vital service for this country and employ , 000 people . on friday , unesa said the government had set an artificial price that does not resolve fundamental###questions about the functioning of the system . unesa added that government###intervention represented an important risk for the liberalization of the energy###market . the auction dispute comes amid a separate fight between the government and renewable###energy investors over whether madrid was entitled to cut subsidies for renewable###energies . the cut has been particularly damaging for producers of solar###power , many of which have struggled to refinance projects backed by spain 's banks before the financial###crisis . in 2008 alone , spain added , 600 megawatts of photovoltaic capacity more than five times what the government had targeted . the economy then floundered , and the euro debt crisis began leaving spain with costly overcapacity . in recent weeks , some international funds have begun legal###proceedings against spain 's overhaul of renewable###energy subsidies before an arbitration panel administered by the world###bank . but the regulatory change has also hurt thousands of small investors , who supported the , 000 solar installations built during the boom###years . rosa barcenilla , a lawyer who took a bank loan of about , 000 to invest along with other members of her family in a solar park near toledo in , said , the government has kept changing the rules since , in breach of the basic principle of legal security that should prevail in any state of law . javier garc a breva , one of spain 's leading renewable###energy experts , detailed in a newsletter this week how the auction dispute showed that spain 's problems went beyond the renewable###energy sector . the headline of his newsletter was total electricity crisis .
centennial , colo . defense lawyers for james e . holmes , who is charged with killing 12 people and wounding dozens more at an aurora , colo . , movie###theater last summer , signaled in court###filings on wednesday that they were willing to have mr . holmes plead###guilty if he was spared the death###penalty . mr . holmes , who faces 166 counts of murder , attempted###murder and other charges , would accept a sentence of life in prison without parole if prosecutors consented to the deal , his lawyers stated in the documents that were filed in arapahoe###county district court . mr . holmes is currently willing to resolve the case to bring the proceedings to a speedy and definite conclusion for all involved , his defense lawyers wrote . it appears the only impediment to a resolution of this case would be if the prosecution chooses to seek the death###penalty . prosecutors are scheduled to announce at a hearing on april 1 whether they intend to pursue the death###penalty , and they have said they would consult with the victims' families first . mr . holmes 's lawyers said that if no deal was reached , they were prepared to go to trial and were still mulling the possibility that they might pursue an insanity###defense . mr . holmes , a former graduate###student in neuroscience at the university of colorado , denver , is charged with opening fire on the audience at an aurora movie###theater during a packed midnight screening of the film the###dark###knight###rises , on july . moments after the shooting , he was arrested by the police in the theater parking###lot , cloaked in body###armor and wearing a gas###mask and a helmet . at a preliminary###hearing in january , prosecutors presented three days of testimony from police and federal###agents who said that mr . holmes had meticulously plotted the attack , one of the worst mass###shootings in american history . defense lawyers were scheduled to enter a plea earlier this month . but at a march 12 hearing , they told judge william b . sylvester that they were not ready . in response , judge sylvester entered a not guilty###plea on mr . holmes 's behalf . in the court###filings on wednesday , the defense lawyers said prosecutors had yet to accept their proposal that mr . holmes spend the rest of life in prison . a spokesman for the district###attorney 's office in arapahoe###county declined to comment on the plea offer . the filings were presented a day after colorado lawmakers voted down a bill to repeal the death###penalty .
miami end the half , end the game has been miami coach joe###philbin 's mantra and on sunday his team did just that , beating the atlanta###falcons 27 23 in a statement comeback that took them to 3 0 for the first time in 11 years . road wins against cleveland and indianapolis had raised the question as to whether the dolphins were emerging as legitimate contenders for a playoff place and in beating an atlanta team that had made the postseason the past three years , miami gave a firm affirmative answer . we 've got a damn good football###team , said dolphins owner stephen ross as he left a dressing###room where the floor was covered with the ice of a celebratory 'gatorade shower' . years of disappointment with just one playoff###game since the 2001 season have left dolphins fans wary of false dawns , skeptical of talk of corners being turned . but ross , whose early decisions since taking###control of the franchise in january 2009 led many to question his and his management team 's credentials , can be forgiven for a bit of euphoric optimism after a win against one of the nfc 's top rated teams . since , 75 percent of the teams that start the season 3 0 have gone on to make the playoffs . crucially , 14 years after dan###marino retired , the dolphins finally have , in second year ryan###tannehill , a quarterback with the necessary quality and composure . he 's a monster . he 's taken the next step and everyone can see he 's been playing well for us all season , said dolphins center mike###pouncey . tannehill showed his passing###ability and cool head to produce a game winning drive of 13 plays and 75 yards , ending with a delightful one yard floated pass to rookie tight###end dion sims with 38 seconds###left . for the second week in a row , miami had ended the half by getting three points on the board this time a 46 yard###field###goal from caleb###sturgis keeping them in touch with the falcons as they went to the break down . the well run two minute###drill is becoming the trademark of this team and philbin 's insistence on its import has clearly got into the minds of his players , as evidenced by the game winning drive . we knew what we needed to do and we have done it multiple###times in practice , said tannehill . we repped that situation constantly and one thing that coach philbin always stresses is 'end the half , end the game' . we knew what we were getting . we knew what we needed to do and it was just a case of stepping up and making plays , he added . in between those two crucial drives there were plenty of signs that philbin still has some work to do if his team is to move from a positive start to long###term success . there were some damaging dropped###passes and tannehill was sacked five times , taking his tally to the season to 14 in three games and there are not surprisingly concerns about the pass protection from the miami offensive###line . but what will please dolphins fans the most is the character the team showed in dealing with setbacks after key defensive###end cameron###wake sat out the second half with a knee###injury and influential outside linebacker koa misi hurt his shoulder in the second half . one man though who is not going to get carried away by the hot start is the mild###mannered philbin who continued his measured appraisal of his team . we have got a bunch of hard working guys who are high character individuals , he said . they 've been very professional and hopefully we can continue to improve . so far , in a city known for flash and glitz , that under stated philbin way is getting results .

madrid an ineffectual barcelona crashed to their first la###liga defeat of the season and failed to restore their three point lead over atletico###madrid at the top when they were beaten 1 0 at athletic###bilbao on sunday . barca were again without the injured lionel###messi , who is not expected back until mid###january , and turned in one of their worst performances of the campaign against a fired###up bilbao at the basque club 's new san mames stadium . a miserable week for the spanish champions , which included tuesday 's 2 1 champions###league loss at ajax###amsterdam , went from bad to worse when bilbao forward iker###muniain stole in to net from close###range in the 71 st minute . barca barely mustered a shot on target against the basques , with brazil forward neymar particularly disappointing , and it was only the second time in 15 matches this season they have dropped points after the 0 0 draw at osasuna in october . gerardo###martino 's side are level with atletico on 40 points following the madrid club 's 2 0 win at promoted elche on saturday , while real###madrid , whose 4 0 drubbing of real###valladolid on saturday included a hat###trick from record signing gareth###bale , are three points further back in third . bilbao ended a streak of 14 winless la###liga games against barca and beat them for the first time since may 2006 to climb above villarreal into fourth on 29 points . it was an open game against a great opponent who pressed us hard and knows how to play , barca midfielder sergio###busquets said in a pitchside interview with spanish television###broadcaster canal plus . they had their moments and we had ours but if we do n't take our chances then it becomes harder , added the spain international . all we can do is congratulate athletic and carry on because there is no other choice . we have to learn from the mistakes we made , which for sure were numerous , but also from the positives . without world player of the year messi creating###havoc in the forward line , barca lacked a cutting###edge against a well organised bilbao unit . neymar forced a superb save from home goalkeeper gorka###iraizoz in the 12th minute but the basque side refused to allow the barca players time and space , creating several clear chances in the first period . they came close when a deflected cross###fell to muniain and he scuffed his close###range shot straight at goalkeeper jose###manuel pinto , playing in place of the injured victor valdes . cesc fabregas played neymar through five minutes after the break but the brazil forward , who had to change his boots in the first half after slipping over several times , sliced his effort well wide . bilbao , who thoroughly deserved their victory and are unbeaten at home this season , almost doubled their lead four minutes after muniain 's goal when pinto produced a brilliant save from gaizka toquero 's unchallenged header . martino threw on pedro late on but the spain forward made little impact and bilbao comfortably held on to their lead . argentine martino , who took over from the ailing tito###vilanova in the close season , complained that the referee should have sent bilbao midfielder ander iturraspe off just before the hour after he felled neymar when he was through on goal . iturraspe escaped with a caution , prompting furious protests from the barca players . the incident could have changed the course of the match , martino told a news conference . i think up to the 70th minute we were superior on the pitch but after that it was a different game . we had moments when we had a great deal of control but what we were lacking perhaps was the precise final pass . in the earlier kickoffs , pressure eased on valencia coach miroslav djukic when a quickfire hat###trick from forward jonas gave his erratic side a 3 0 win at home to 10 man osasuna . osasuna had their 38 year old captain patxi punal sent off in the 16th minute for a dangerous late tackle on dani parejo before jonas struck from close###range just before the break . the brazilian netted his second three minutes into the second half and made it 3 0 in the 53rd minute as valencia moved up to ninth on 20 points . sevilla kept in touch with the european qualification places when they won 2 1 at andalusian rivals granada and tightened their grip on eighth with 22 points . sevilla 's city rivals real###betis drew 2 2 at home to fellow###strugglers rayo###vallecano and stay rooted to the bottom .
sydney , australia general###motors said wednesday that it would stop making cars in australia within four years because of high costs and a strong###local currency , fueling fears that its rival toyota motors would follow###suit and cripple the entire domestic###industry . the decision by g.m. , the world 's second largest automaker , to close its plants at its holden subsidiary in south###australia and victoria states caps a dire year for australian manufacturing in general and auto production in particular . no matter which way we apply the numbers , our long###term business###case to make and assemble cars in this country is simply not viable , the general###manager , mike devereux , told###reporters at g.m . 's plant in adelaide . the move will pile more pressure on prime###minister tony###abbott 's conservative government , which is seeking to manage a slowdown in the . 5 trillion economy as a decade###long mining investment boom slows . the decision to end manufacturing in australia reflects the perfect###storm of negative influences the automotive###industry faces in the country , including the sustained strength of the australian###dollar , high cost of production , small domestic###market and arguably the most competitive and fragmented auto###market in the world , g.m . 's chairman and chief###executive , daniel f . akerson , said in a statement . toyota said g.m . 's decision to stop production in australia would affect its ability to make cars in the country . this will place unprecedented pressure on the local supplier network and our ability to build cars in australia , toyota###australia said in a news release . the company said it would work with suppliers and the government to determine its next steps and whether it could continue###operating as the only automaker after g.m . leaves . there have been widespread concerns that an exit by g.m . holden would be followed by toyota 's threatening about 150 parts and component suppliers that directly employ more than , 000 people . it 's now highly likely that toyota will leave australia . in fact it 's almost certain , said dave###smith , the australian###manufacturing###workers###union 's national vehicles division secretary . in may , ford###motor said it would shut down its two australian auto plants in october mitsubishi###motors left in . the announcement wednesday came only one day after a local g.m . executive said the company needed more assistance from the australian###government to survive in the long###term . g.m . has made this decision . it is irreversible , said mr . devereux , responding to a question on whether it would have changed its mind if the government provided###assistance . australian manufacturing employs about , 000 people , having declined by more than , 000 in the past decade as a persistently strong australian###dollar and high costs make imports more competitive .
montreal max###pacioretty was hardly in the mood to celebrate after his game###winning###goal for the canadiens . the big forward sent boston###bruins defenseman johnny###boychuk to the hospital with a first period check into the boards thursday###night , then scored the go ahead goal in the second during montreal 's 2 1 victory . pacioretty 's ninth goal in the last nine games helped the canadiens stretch their unbeaten run to nine games . it also put montreal ( 18 9 3 ) in first place in the atlantic###division , a point ahead of boston , which has two games in hand . it was n't really a strong game for me , he said . i got the life sucked out of me when that injury happened . i just felt awful . only 28 into the first meeting of the season between these bitter###rivals , pacioretty checked boychuk into the end boards in the montreal zone . boychuk went face first into the top of the boards and fell to the ice . he was on his knees , taking heavy breaths , for several minutes before trainers and medical###staff got him onto a stretcher and wheeled him off the ice . after the game , bruins coach claude julien said boychuk was released from the hospital and would travel with the team back to boston . julien had no details about the injury , which bruins players said appeared to be a back problem . the hit was n't hard , but it was somewhat from behind . pacioretty was given 2 minutes for boarding , which both teams felt was the right call . i felt terrible about it because i did n't really know what happened , pacioretty said . i was just battling for the puck . i 've been in that situation before . i had no intent to injure anybody . the bruins seemed to agree , and none of them rushed to seek###vengeance as is often the case when a teammate gets hurt . the injury quieted the bell###centre crowd and took some steam out of the play on the ice for the rest of the period . i think they gave me the benefit of the doubt , pacioretty said . and the canadiens , outshot 10 3 in the opening period and down 1 0 on a goal by gregory campbell , jumped on boston in the second with an 18 7 shots advantage and goals from tomas plekanec and pacioretty . the bruins stormed back in the third , but could n't###beat carey###price , who finished with 32 saves . montreal put 27 shots on tuukka###rask . boston had not played since saturday , while montreal was coming off a###4 3 shootout win wednesday###night in new jersey . the canadiens were playing their third game in four nights and sixth in nine nights , but they were n't###easy pickings for the bruins . the second period was atrocious , julien said . it was unacceptable . there are no excuses about playing with five defensemen . we have to look in the mirror . boston got the first goal at the 35 mark . andrei markov cleared the puck to the boston blue line , where dennis###seidenberg kicked it forward , sending milan###lucic in on a 2 on 1 break . the big###wing slipped a pass to campbell for a shot into an open side . plekanec tied it 16 into the second when he beat rask from a tight###angle with a medium###speed wrist shot . a burst of speed from brendan gallagher caused###confusion in the boston defense and pacioretty backhanded raphael###diaz 's rebound in from the slot at 42 . pacioretty 's last nine goals have all come in five games on home###ice . the first one was off to the side of the net and i gave ( plekanec ) too much net to shoot at , rask said . the second was a high rebound and he scored . but if you look at how we played in the second period , you ca n't be happy with that . montreal has beaten boston four straight times dating to last season . i 'm proud of my players , said canadiens coach michel###therrien , whose team plays again saturday###night at home against buffalo . even if we had a slow###start , we adjusted well in the second period . my players emptied the tank and they were rewarded . the teams meet again jan . 30 in boston . notes montreal dressed douglas###murray and george###parros , and sat francis bouillon and ryan###white , who both played wednesday in new jersey . rene###bourque remains sidelined with an upper body injury . ... parros got his first shot on goal in seven games with the canadiens . ... adam###mcquaid ( lower body ) was out for boston , while jordan caron and kevan miller were healthy scratches . ... as in other nhl rinks , a moment of silence was held for nelson###mandela .
atlanta on monday , henrik###stenson beheaded his driver at the 18th hole and damaged a locker while venting over a , the sixth worst final round score at the bmw championship . on tuesday and wednesday , he toured the east###lake###golf###club course for the first time ever , practicing the front side and merely strolling the back , then voiced concern about an aching left###wrist . frustration that results in destruction , unfamiliarity with the layout and soreness in a significant body part hardly add up to an ideal lead in to the tour championship . but stenson , an apparent quick learner who effectively blows off steam and suppresses mild pain , breezed through his first round thursday with a six under par 64 at the event that concludes the tour season . stenson stuffed five birdies into his opening seven holes , daring everyone else to catch up . one player did , for a while . adam scott started the back nine with six birdies in seven holes , then closed with two pars for a 65 in a happy return to georgia after winning the masters in augusta five months###ago . stenson 's birdie at the par 3 18th broke the tie . revisiting his monday meltdown , stenson said this was a good turnaround mentally . i stayed very levelheaded . kept the head on on both myself and my driver . a hotheaded tendency , stenson confessed , sometimes overtakes him . it kind of builds up and eventually it goes over the limit , he said . in his latest episode , he slammed the club that betrayed him into the turf . then he forced a locker door to become unhinged and smashed a shelf . he apologized and offered to pay for repairs . i just needed to realize the world is a good place again , he said . i was just tired , and i pushed myself over the edge . that 's not the best frame of mind to play good golf . i 'm really delighted with the change i made . adjusting to a previously###unseen course proved less daunting . at a european###tour stop in , stenson recalled , a sore neck limited him to walking an entire grounds with only two clubs . he won by four strokes . the ailing wrist , which stenson said was unrelated to his tantrum , was worrisome , but he said ice , medicine and treatment eased the discomfort . on wednesday###morning , he said , gripping a toothbrush triggered pain . i hope it 's just a one off that will go away , he said . a european player has never won the fedex###cup tournament , which was instituted seven years###ago and lavishes the champion with a 10 million###bonus . stenson , a swede who is no . 2 in the cup###standings behind tiger###woods , arrived as a primary contender . a tournament win would be complemented by the fedex championship and enough money to finance dressing###room repairs many times over . at no . 3 , scott , a native of australia and a resident of switzerland , entered in the same enviable situation , but he missed three greens on wedge shots during a desultory front nine . a birdie###putt at no . 10 restored his serenity and put him in the same groove he attained at the masters . i love playing great golf###courses , he said , dismissing the notion of a special georgia alchemy , and obviously this is one of them . stenson was paired with woods , which some golfers find intimidating , given the sizable galleries that follow his every swing . but it was woods , the lone multiple cup###champion , who caved , recording a 73 that was superior to only one of the other 29 contestants , jason dufner . it 's a position where you need to be extra focused , stenson said . it 's a bit more shouting , a bit more people moving around and such . that just demands a little bit of higher###concentration . unfamiliarity with the course was no hindrance , either , to another early challenger , billy###horschel , who took an instant###liking to east lake with a . it 's fun to finally be here , said the high energy horschel , 26 , who spends much of his winters on a snowboard . i feel like a kid in a candy store . horschel was even with steve###stricker , who has shrunk his tour schedule to spend more time with his family . as one of three players to qualify for every tour championship of the fedex era , he feels right at home . roberto###castro , alone at , is a cup rookie but no stranger to east lake , having filled out nearly 100 scorecards here . eight golfers were bunched at , notably sergio garc a , who heard boos on the first tee , but they were not directed at him . garc a 's playing partner was boo###weekley , who attended###college in georgia and is often greeted by his nickname . garc a 's round began inauspiciously when his first shot veered left and plunked a spectator in the thigh . leslie douglas was peering at the tee , wondering if garc a had swung , when she got a painful answer . the ball left a bruise that did not require medical attention . garc a plucked another ball out of his bag , signed it and tossed her a souvenir . i like watching him play , douglas , 22 , said . next time , i 'll stay to the right .
when a western scrub###jay dies , researchers report , other jays may hold a kind of funeral screeching over the body for as long as half an hour . it is not clear yet exactly why the birds display this behavior . perhaps having more individuals helps them locate and chase away the predator , said teresa iglesias , an evolutionary###biologist at the university of california , davis , and an author of a new study on the jays . larger###groups of birds are better at chasing away predators from an area . dr . iglesias and her colleagues report their findings in the journal animal###behaviour . after securing permits , the researchers gathered dead jays and loose feathers , then dried and preserved them . when other jays encountered the dead bird , they flew into trees above and made loud screeching calls that attracted other jays . the birds formed similar gatherings and screeched when they encountered a model of a stuffed horned###owl ( a predator , but did not react to painted###wood , which was used as a control . bees and some aquatic animals react to chemicals given off by their dead , and other animals including chimpanzees , elephants , crows and magpies also react to the sight of dead comrades . although this research does not explore whether the jays are having an emotional###reaction , dr . iglesias said , it is not out of the question . if it works for us , why not other animals ? she said .
inside bright hope###baptist###church , the luminaries of philadelphia 's black political world gathered for the funeral of former representative###william h . gray iii in july . dozens of politicians city , state and federal packed the pews as former president###bill###clinton offered a stirring eulogy , quoting scripture and proudly telling the crowd that he was once described as the only white man in america who knew all the verses to 'lift every voice and sing . ' but it was the presence and behavior of hillary###rodham###clinton that most intrigued former gov . edward g . rendell during a quiet moment , mrs . clinton leaned over to the governor and pressed him for details about the backgrounds , and the influence , of the assembled black leaders . since mrs . clinton left the secretary of state post in february , she and her husband have sought to soothe and strengthen their relationship with african###americans , the constituency that was most scarred during her first bid for the presidency . five years after remarks by mr . clinton about barack###obama deeply strained the clintons' bond with african###americans , the former first family is setting out to ensure that there is no replay of such trouble in . mrs . clinton used two of her most high###profile speeches , including one before a black sorority convention , to address minority voting rights an explosive issue among african###americans since the supreme###court struck down part of the voting###rights###act in june . a month after mr . gray 's funeral , mrs . clinton and her husband both asked to speak at the service for bill lynch , a black political###strategist who is credited with the election of david n . dinkins as mayor of new york , and stayed for well over two hours in a crowd full of well connected mourners . and there have been constant personal gestures , especially by the former president . i think that this is an effort to repair whatever damage they felt may have been done in ' , said the rev . al###sharpton . mr . and mrs . clinton know that there are some who have lingering questions , if not antipathy , towards them , mr . sharpton said . this task has taken on new urgency given the democratic###party 's push to the left , away from the centrist politics with which the clintons are identified . strong###support from black###voters could serve as a bulwark for mrs . clinton against a liberal primary###challenge should she decide to run for president in . it would be difficult for a progressive###candidate , such as senator elizabeth###warren of massachusetts , to rise if the former first lady takes back the black###voters she lost to mr . obama and retains the blue###collar white###voters who flocked to her . her appearance before the sisters of delta###sigma###theta in july , which she opened by offering condolences to the family of trayvon###martin , the 17 year old who was killed in florida last year , and her voting rights address to the american###bar###association in august drew significant###attention among black leaders . that speech that she gave regarding voting suppression was very , very significant and meaningful , said representative###james e . clyburn , a south###carolina democrat and the highest###ranking african###american in congress . mr . clyburn , who clashed sharply with mr . clinton in , said mrs . clinton was now in a very good place with the african###american community . tavis###smiley , a black commentator , argued that this was because they have now learned the important###lesson that there 's a distinction between a coronation and an election . the clintons appear to be taking nothing for granted . mr . clinton did not just attend the 50th anniversary of the march on washington on the national###mall in august , but also showed up at arlington###cemetery in june to honor medgar###evers on the 50th anniversary of his assassination . in may , mr . clinton was the commencement###speaker at howard###university in washington , posing for pictures with all who asked and sitting on stage next to one of the school 's best known graduates , l . douglas###wilder , the nation 's first elected black governor from virginia , a longtime###friend and rival of mr . clinton 's . in private , mr . clinton is frequently in touch with black leaders . representative elijah e . cummings , a maryland democrat and the ranking###member on the house panel on government###oversight , got a handwritten###note from the former president over the summer commending him on his leadership on the committee . he has made an effort to reach out over and over again through the years , mr . cummings said . the congressman recalled mr . clinton 's visits to his church in baltimore and a phone call he got from the former president inquiring about the health of his mother , whose name mr . clinton recalled . such personal touches , for which the clintons are famous , have never been more important as mrs . clinton considers a second presidential###bid . mr . clinton has a rich , if occasionally fraught , history with african###americans . he was a new south governor and a progressive on race who would eventually be called the first black president by the author toni###morrison . but he infuriated blacks in 2008 when , after mr . obama won a big###south carolina primary victory , he seemed to dismiss the achievement by reminding the press that the rev . jesse###jackson had won the state twice and calling mr . obama 's antiwar position the biggest fairy###tale i 've ever seen . many african###americans took mr . clinton 's fairy###tale comment to mean that mr . obama 's candidacy itself was a hopeless fantasy .
paris defying the bitterly low###expectations of a populace that had largely written them off as prima donnas , the french national###soccer###team defeated ukraine , 3 0 , on tuesday###night and secured a place at the 2014 world###cup in brazil . first half goals by mamadou###sakho and karim###benzema and a fortunate bounce off a ukraine defender for an own goal in the second half completed a comeback that had seemed impossible to many . ukraine had upset france , 2 0 , in the first leg of their home and home playoff , a defeat that seemed to augur france 's elimination and a potential new low for a team that has inspired more resentment than love in recent###years . france 's team has not yet shaken off the ignominy of its early exit from the 2010 world###cup in south###africa , where it failed to win a game and endured a player revolt that , at one point , led the team to refuse to practice . the debacle led to the resignation of the coach and the reorganization of the federation under a new president . still , commentators across the country had projected the worst for les bleus on tuesday , noting that the team , whose roster features european stars like real###madrid 's benzema and bayern###munich 's franck###rib###ry , had consistently underperformed . comparisons were drawn between the seemingly doomed state of the team and the depressive state of the french economy . it 's true that watching les bleus friday at kiev , one said to oneself that this french team was a bit in the image of our country sick , wrote yves thr ard , a top editor at the national daily le###figaro , in a front page###editorial . instead , the team and the nation breathed sighs of relief at the final whistle inside stade###de###france . it 's the magic of football , coach didier###deschamps told the associated press . four days###ago , we were bad , very bad . i 've###experienced some great###moments , but this one is special . but claiming a berth in the world###cup , the players and their fans know , is just the first step . since the embarrassment in south###africa , french players have been criticized as egotists unwilling to play as a team . the french are better players , but ukraine is a better team , said vincent duluc , a senior soccer reporter at l' quipe , france 's leading sporting newspaper . the french do not have a collective spirit and are widely###viewed as reflecting the individualism of modern###times , he said . to qualify , duluc said before the match , would require some chance element of the irrational . that surprise element may have come with an own goal by ukraine 's oleg gusev in the 72nd minute , off a cross intended for sakho in a crowded penalty###area . ( sakho celebrated the goal as his own . ) or it may have come in the 47th minute , with the red card given to ukraine 's yevhen khacheridi , which meant the visitors had to play with a man down for nearly the entire second half . by that time , the french had tied the playoff on aggregate on sakho 's goal on a rebound in the 22nd minute and benzema 's similar goal in the 33rd , though replays showed he was offside and maintained a punishingly aggressive pace . from the starting whistle , we 'll have to show what we 're capable of , play at our best level , the french captain hugo###lloris had told###reporters monday . a loss might have meant the firing of deschamps , the popular captain of france 's 1998 world###cup champions . he was brought in a year ago to reform les bleus and promote team play until tuesday , the results had been viewed as mixed , at best . had the french failed to qualify , brazil would have been the first world###cup they missed since the 1994 edition , held in the united###states . their qualification meant , in the words of one french editorialist , that the spurned national###team had avoided the worst . but duluc , the reporter at l' quipe , warned that the team 's reputation had hardly been righted . we 'll have to wait for the results of the world###cup for a reconciliation , he said .
brisbane , australia roger###federer arrived down under on saturday for the brisbane international with a refreshed outlook for , no injuries and a new coach on his team . it 's the first time in a year that i could practice three , four weeks in a row without any setbacks ... i was able to do more than i thought which is very encouraging , federer said of his offseason . i did n't###play any exhibitions which allowed me to train extremely###hard and for a longer###period of time . federer , who will use the brisbane event as his only warm up tournament ahead of the australian###open which begins jan . 13 in melbourne , announced on facebook on friday that he 'd added former no . 1 stefan###edberg to his coaching###team for at least 10 weeks . edberg , a six time###grand###slam###champion , including the australian###open in 1985 and , joins federer 's support team under head###coach severin luthi . federer , the winner of a record 17 grand###slams , finished 2013 ranked no . 6 after struggling with a bad back for much of the season . every time i had training ( in the past ) i had setbacks , little aches###and###pains , especially in the back from time to time ... which cost me confidence , federer said . these last few months have been important for me , feeling that movement is not an issue any more . the brisbane tournament is also a wta###event which includes serena###williams and maria###sharapova as its top draw###cards . next week , the atp and wta will again combine at the sydney international . federer , who has a first round###bye , will face either australian wild###card entry james###duckworth or finnish veteran jarkko###nieminen in the second round . second seeded kei###nishikori of japan , no . 3 gilles###simon of france and fourth###seeded kevin###anderson of south###africa also received###byes into the second round , as did williams and victoria###azarenka in the women 's draw . third seeded sharapova will play caroline garcia of france in the first round . at the hopman###cup , also part of the australian###open series , canada beat australia with wins in the opening two singles matches . bouchard broke stosur 's serve to go up 5 3 in the deciding###set , then took advantage of two forehand errors to clinch the match . raonic used his strong serve to wear tomic down . he has the best serve in the world right now , tomic said . there was n't much i could do . in the other group a clash saturday , poland beat italy . agnieszka radwanska defeated flavia###pennetta , 6 2 in women 's singles and andreas###seppi had to retire from his match with illness while trailing , 2 2 to grzegorz###panfil . seppi could not play the mixed###doubles , giving poland a 3 0 win . the united###states , represented by sloane###stephens and john###isner , plays its first match on monday against spain in group b . france and czech###republic are the other group b teams , with the winners of each group playing in the jan . 4 final . the auckland wta###tournament , which includes venus###williams , lost another player when britain 's laura###robson pulled out with a left wrist###injury . russian 's elena###vesnina , who would have been the asb###classic 's fourth###seed , withdrew last week . tournament director karl budge said robson had told him she is about 95 percent fit and is not in danger of missing the australian###open . ap sports writer steve mcmorran contributed to this report from wellington , new zealand .
almost everywhere that the united###states national###soccer###team goes , coach jurgen klinsmann is the most recognized member of the traveling party . whether it is san###pedro###sula or sarajevo , klinsmann , a world###cup winning striker with germany , is catnip for soccer fans , autograph seekers and admirers . on tuesday , though , klinsmann 's fame may be challenged . that is because the united###states' exhibition###game against austria is being played in vienna a charming capital###city known for its music and history and , in the case of the local###sports fans , also as the place where andreas herzog became a star . herzog , who has been one of klinsmann 's top assistants since , holds the record for most career###appearances for austria . an attacking###midfielder who was a team captain , he scored 26 goals in 103 games for his country , including a memorable blast in 1997 that helped send austria to the world###cup . the goal was so important it was immortalized on an austrian stamp . after herzog 's long and successful club career in austria , germany and , for a season , los###angeles , his stature in vienna , his hometown , is unmatched . a lot of the guys have been asking me about reservations at restaurants and things , herzog , 45 , said through a laugh last week before the americans' scoreless###tie with scotland in glasgow . i tell them i will do what i can . of course , herzog is more than just a tour###guide . he is , along with martin vasquez , among klinsmann 's most important advisers , and often focuses on offensive players and tactics . because he still lives in austria , herzog is also the de facto european contact for the united###states national###team , scouting games on the continent and reporting to klinsmann , who lives in california . having herzog in europe allows klinsmann to keep up with how his players are faring with their club teams and allows the coaching###staff to make informed###decisions when considering which players to call in for training###camps and games . we have the challenge that our players are spread out , klinsmann said of a problem shared by many non european national###teams . we basically built a european office , and andy is living in vienna and covers that . it was an important###step for us that we have a presence here in europe . it gives us another dimension . herzog said he did not expect that his personal coaching track would take him through the united###states . he has known klinsmann since the two were teammates at bayern###munich in , but he had looked to be in line to become the manager of the austrian team . herzog worked as an assistant for the team and coached the country 's under 21 squad , but he was passed over on three occasions for the top job . one of those near misses came shortly after a brutal experience in glasgow when herzog watched his under 21 side lose on an 89 th minute###goal that bounced the team from qualifying for the european championships . herzog said the crushing defeat was a reason cited by austrian officials when they informed him they were selecting someone else to lead the senior###team . i still love austria , but it 's not my dream###job anymore , herzog said . i had n't thought i would be an assistant anymore , but i enjoy what i am doing . i feel very proud to be working with jurgen . herzog 's soccer knowledge runs deep . he grew up in vienna watching his father , anton , play professionally . herzog was a ball###boy for his father 's teams , watching with envy when the players would get on the bus together after a game . all i wanted was to someday ride a bus or maybe even get on an airplane for an important match , herzog said . my father was a very good player , but it was a different time . football was only just becoming truly professional like we know it now toward the end of his career . in some ways , herzog is necessarily grateful to his father for not being as intense about the game as herzog turned out to be . anton was called up to the austrian national###team for the first time when he was about , andreas herzog said , but approached the manager just before the trip to inquire if he would be starting in the coming match against finland . when the manager replied that he was not sure , anton informed him that he had just met a woman recently and , if he would not be starting , he would prefer to skip the trip . that woman was my mother , herzog said . and my father did n't go . now herzog is the one balancing family and soccer obligations , as his wife and two sons are often left behind in vienna when he travels for work . it is difficult for him to miss seeing his 6 year old jumping about as a giddy goalkeeper or his 3 year old kicking the ball around the living###room , but being part of the united###states program has been a fantastic experience , he said . i love it , he added . and it will be nice to have a game at home this time , too .
benjamin###britten was delighted to have been born on nov . 22 , the feast day of st . cecilia , the patron###saint of musicians and church###music . that the year of his birth , 1913 , was also the centennial of verdi and wagner is something britten never particularly remarked upon in later life . yet that coincidence has complicated things for britten this year , the 100th anniversary of his birth in the town of lowestoft on the coast of east###anglia in england . celebrations of the verdi and wagner bicentennials have been plentiful around the world and will continue this fall . inevitably , britten , the most important figure of 20th century british music , and , for me , among the handful of 20th century giants , is being eclipsed by the dynamic###duo of italian and german opera . england , of course , has been awash in britten this year . the britten pears foundation , named for the composer and his lifelong partner , the tenor peter###pears , has been overseeing a series of international events under the britten 100 banner . in addition , britten 's record###label , decca , has just weighed in , literally , with a deluxe , six pound boxed###set of his complete###works , containing 65 cds , a bonus###dvd and several booklets of informative program###notes . in cooperation with britten , carnegie###hall is teaming up with other new york institutions , including the metropolitan###opera , the brooklyn###academy###of###music , the new york philharmonic and trinity wall###street , to honor him . carnegie###hall 's contribution , an extensive and smartly organized series , looks to be a high###point of the coming###season . britten 's landmark opera , peter###grimes , which brought him international###renown after its 1945 premiere in london , is the most ambitious offering of the festival . on nov . 22 , david###robertson will conduct the st . louis###symphony###orchestra and chorus in a concert performance of peter###grimes at stern auditorium , starring the tenor anthony###dean###griffey in what has become his signature role . he brings uninhibited dramatic intensity and a distinctive###voice , at once lyrical and powerful , to his portrayal of grimes , a hulking , isolated fisherman in a small suffolk coastal###village in england , part poetic dreamer , part dangerous misfit . mr . griffey sang the role to acclaim in the director john###doyle 's production that the met introduced in . this summer he again excelled as grimes in a semi###staged performance of the opera at the aspen###music###festival . the carnegie###hall series begins on oct . 20 with a program offering britten 's complete canticles . these five extended vocal works accompanied by various small###groups of instruments were written over three decades . each has a major part for a tenor , the one constant in a diverse set . the texts range from medieval mystery plays to poems by edith###sitwell and t . s . eliot . the tenor ian###bostridge , who has championed these seldom###heard works , will perform them on this program at zankel hall , joined by the countertenor iestyn davies , the baritone joshua hopkins and the pianist julius###drake . the program includes some britten arrangements of purcell songs , ideal companion works . three nights later , on oct . 23 , the orchestra of st . luke 's under its new principal###conductor , pablo heras casado , performs britten 's great serenade for tenor , horn and strings , featuring mr . bostridge , a program that includes mendelssohn 's overture to a midsummer night 's dream and shostakovich 's ninth###symphony . there are also two smaller###scale events of great interest the dynamic british based endellion string###quartet plays works by britten and schubert ( nov . 8 at weill###recital###hall the impressive brooklyn youth###chorus sings a program called britten 's young voices ( nov . 17 at zankel hall . and all afternoon on dec . 14 , there will be a discovery day exploring britten 's life and works through panels , videos , a lecture and a voice recital . when carnegie###hall presents a festival , the goal is to keep events within a relatively concentrated time frame . the britten celebration spans seven weeks this fall , with one exception robert###spano will conduct the atlanta###symphony###orchestra and chorus in britten 's wrenchingly beautiful war###requiem , with mr . griffey among the vocal###soloists , but not until april . the concert should be worth waiting for . the institutional partners in carnegie###hall 's celebration have come up with some enticing programs , especially trinity wall###street 's celebrating benjamin###britten , offering more than 20 concerts from september through december , including choral works , songs and pieces for children . that verdi and wagner continue to loom large over the field of opera is clear from the met 's programming in this year of three anniversaries . while the company honored wagner with a major new production of parsifal that opened in february and will celebrate verdi with a new falstaff in december , britten is only getting a revival in october . still , it 's a worthy one , his ingenious adaptation of shakespeare 's midsummer night 's dream in the tim albery production that the met introduced in 1996 and last presented in .
not long###ago , there were two fox###sports west and prime###ticket , also a fox channel . now there are six , in large part because of the aggressiveness of time warner cable . in , it lured the los###angeles###lakers from fox###sports west to its new english and spanish###language networks at an estimated###price of 3 billion over 20 years . on monday , time warner cable announced what has been expected for a while , saying that in a deal###worth up to 8 billion over 25 years , it will carry dodgers games on the newfangled sportsnet la starting in 2014 when the team leaves prime###ticket . add to that the regional channel created by the pacific 12 conference . while all this money being exchanged might be great for the teams , it 's lousy for the fans . with one team , sportsnet la alone could add up to 5 a month to the costs of cable , satellite and telephone companies . they in turn pass much of those costs onto subscribers . the two lakers channels charge 4 a month . and the two fox channels together cost . 40 a month , according to snl kagan . the dodgers' deal shows a company simultaneously at work in two roles time warner is the largest cable###television operator in southern###california and a regional###sports###network creator . in its first role , it wants to avoid , if it can , going through a middleman to buy the rights to marquee sports teams . by creating a network to showcase the dodgers , it can guarantee that all of its subscribers get that network , while also extracting steep subscriber fees from at t , verizon , cox , charter , directv and dish###network . the new dodgers ownership playing out the vision of the disgraced former owner , frank###mccourt will take in a huge amount of cash just for putting a team on the field 162 times a year . time warner will pay the team 7 billion to 8 billion over 25 years . but only a portion of that staggering sum , about 84 million a year , which will rise at 4 percent###annually , is designated as the team 's market value rights###fee and taxable at a 34 percent rate for major###league###baseball 's revenue###sharing pool . this is quite nice for the dodgers if baseball upholds it . the remaining billions it will get from odd sources like branding rights for time warner cable and buying time on the channel for other time warner cable programming also rises at 4 percent a year . and that would not be subject to revenue###sharing . sweet indeed a terrific tax###shelter . once they get a hold of the contract , baseball officials will see if what is slated to be untaxed should really be taxed and available to share . if the money is guaranteed , and not at risk , it should be taxed . guggenheim###partners , the financial###services giant that backed last march 's . 15 billion purchase of the dodgers , might reluctantly have to share more than it wants . throughout , it seems clear that guggenheim was eager to minimize the bite that revenue###sharing would take , said lee berke , a media###consultant who specializes in regional###sports###networks . it seems a way to thread the needle to achieve a substantial upside . it 's a complex way around revenue###sharing . the dodgers time warner cable deal is the culmination of a tense drama inside baseball that began when mccourt , financially struggling and prohibited by commissioner bud###selig from extending his deal with fox , put the team into bankruptcy . ( that deal included a 385 million upfront sweetener . ) in a process overseen by a federal bankruptcy court judge , mccourt sold the team last march to guggenheim . even at his most nakedly desperate , mccourt knew how much more valuable the dodgers would be as a television product once the team could negotiate on the open###market . that opening occurred late last year when guggenheim let prospective bidders know that it would make a deal only for a regional###sports###network . all dodgers all the time . fox 's offer , evidently not as enticing or willing to hit the tripwires of baseball 's revenue###sharing system , included giving the dodgers some ownership of prime###ticket . the vast###sums promised to the dodgers might lead , on one level , to more dodgers programming that only tommy###lasorda might be able to tolerate . but that bounty also seems a precursor to higher###costs for sports fans in los###angeles and everywhere else .

new york san###francisco and houston were chosen on tuesday as host###cities for the 2016 and 2017 super###bowls after national###football###league ( nfl ) team###owners voted for the two ahead of miami . the san###francisco###bay###area will host the 50th super###bowl in early 2016 at levi 's stadium , the brand new home of the 49 ers , which is still under construction . then houston will stage the 51 st edition of the sport 's championship game in early 2017 at reliant###stadium , the home of the texans . miami , which had already hosted the super###bowl a record###tying 10 times , was the odd city out in a three way contest . the south###florida bid was doomed after miami###dolphins owner stephen ross was unable to secure enough state funding to redevelop the team 's 26 year old stadium . ( tuesday 's ) decision does n't dampen our enthusiasm to pursue super###bowls in the future , since we are steadfast in our belief that those games are good for the south###florida community , ross said in a statement . the only previous time the super###bowl was played in the bay###area was in , when the 49 ers beat the miami###dolphins at stanford###stadium . the 49 ers , one of the nfl 's most successful teams , won the last of their five championships in january 1995 but made the super###bowl last season , losing to the baltimore###ravens in new orleans . the northern###california city is in the midst of a golden period in sport with the san###francisco###giants winning the major###league###baseball world###series two of the last three seasons . the city 's spectacular bay is the host site for this year 's america 's cup yachting series while the space###age levi 's stadium is being built in santa###clara , just south of san###francisco . the stadium will seat nearly , 000 people and will feature stadium wide wi###fi , streaming###video , mobile connectivity , in seat tablet holders and huge high###definition###video boards measuring over , 000 square###feet . the bid had the backing some of the biggest industry names in silicon###valley , such as apple , google and yahoo and a 2010 report estimated the super###bowl would generate between 300 million and 500 million for the region . it 's an awesome , awesome thing that they 've allowed one of the biggest games , the golden###anniversary , to be played in the golden###state , 49 ers chief###executive jed york said . we look forward to nfl fans from around the globe enjoying our region and our stadium , the likes of which cannot be found anywhere else in the world . houston will be hosting the game for the third time after 1974 and . this is a worldwide stage that will be constructed in houston and the world will be watching , houston###texans owner###bob mcnair said . it 's an opportunity to showcase our wonderful city , the nfl and the super###bowl all at the same time . the next super###bowl will be held in february 2014 in east###rutherford in new jersey , the home of the new york giants and new york jets , while the 2015 game will be held at the university###of###phoenix###stadium , the home###ground for the arizona###cardinals .
in the days before aaron alexis called the police in newport , r.i. , to complain that he was hearing###voices sent by a microwave machine , employees at the residence inn in nearby middletown were struggling to cope with his behavior . daily logs kept by the hotel detailed how on successive###nights , he knocked on doors to find the voices , woke up a person in one room and frightened another so badly she asked to move . then came a call from his employer . brenda from the experts inc . called re mr . alexis in , a residence inn employee noted in a log dated aug . 7 that was reviewed by the new york times . she explained that he is unstable and the company is bringing him home , the entry continued . she asked me to check the room ( it was vacant , and check him out . the call from the company , placed six weeks before mr . alexis , a former navy reservist who the police say shot and killed 12 people at the washington###navy###yard , suggests it had deep concerns about his state of mind and raises###questions about why he continued to be sent to navy bases in different states to work on their computer systems . company officials have said that although they knew mr . alexis was complaining about voices , they believed he was saying that the hotel was too noisy . the company did not respond immediately to requests for comment on thursday . it was one of numerous###occasions in the weeks just before the shootings on monday when mr . alexis' increasingly bizarre###behavior was noted by others , including hotel employees , guards at a virginia airport and the police in newport . yet no one managed to head off the violence . much remains###unknown about mr . alexis' life and what drove his actions , gaps that are likely to remain at least partly unfilled with his fatal shooting by police###officers at the navy###yard . but as details emerge , they suggest a man engaged in an intense internal###struggle for control , a battle he ultimately###lost . and like other mass killers before him james e . holmes in colorado , jared l . loughner in arizona , seung###hui###cho in virginia he left a trail of telltale signs that were minimized , misinterpreted or ignored . in many ways , mr . alexis , 34 , seemed a jumble of contradictions . in fort###worth , where he spent###years in the navy###reserve , he was described as friendly and sociable , drinking heineken at bars with co workers and chatting with customers at the thai restaurant happy bowl , where he worked for a time . but he also held a piece of himself apart . he would kind of close into himself , said melinda downs , who knew him in fort###worth and served as a motherly figure in his life . he did n't let a whole bunch of people in , because he 'd been hurt . he handled himself carefully . like others , ms . downs recalled mr . alexis as sweet and often playful . but he also had outbursts of rage , some extreme he told the police in seattle in 2004 that he shot out the tires of a construction###worker 's car in an anger fueled blackout . and co workers at the borough###of###manhattan###community###college in new york described him as a person who held on to grudges and did not tolerate fools gladly . perhaps in an effort to keep his more violent emotions in check , mr . alexis practiced theravada###buddhism , meditating for hours on the thick rugs of a temple in white settlement , the suburb west of fort###worth where he lived on and off for three years . he told one man affiliated with the temple that he aspired to be a monk , but he would stay up late at night playing violent###video###games in his room . mr . alexis , a computer specialist who led an itinerant life , traveling to naval###installations around the country to service their systems , seemed aware of his emotional###problems , telling friends he suffered from depression and post###traumatic###stress###disorder . but it is not clear whether he ever sought mental###health treatment . visiting an emergency###room at a veterans' medical center in august , he said only that he was having trouble###sleeping , according to the department###of###veterans###affairs .
( reuters ) swansea###city striker michu faces ankle surgery that will rule him out for six weeks and may push the injury hit welsh club to seek a replacement in the january###transfer###window . the spaniard underwent a scan on his injured###ankle after missing sunday 's 2 1 home###defeat by everton . the 27 year old , who has scored###six###goals in all competitions this season , has had ankle and knee problems in recent###months . it 's not good news , manager michael###laudrup told the club website ( www . swanseacity . net ) on tuesday . unfortunately it has been confirmed that he will need an operation . the good news is that it can be done in the next week and he should be back playing in around a month and a half . but what has happened in the last couple of weeks has changed things . we will probably do something now in january and try to add something that we do n't have in certain positions , said laudrup . the numbers are a bit down and that is risky for the last four months of the season . laudrup said he could sign spanish forward iago aspas , 26 , on loan from liverpool . he is an interesting player but he is at liverpool and they have injuries as well so that might not be possible , he added . we are looking at other options . swansea , 11th in the premier###league , face chelsea at stamford###bridge on thursday . they then travel to aston###villa on saturday before hosting free scoring manchester###city on january . the club have received a boost after welsh defender ben###davies , 20 , signed a new contract until . laudrup said he 's a very positive story . not just for us but for welsh football in general because it must be nice to see one of your own coming through . he came in and took his chance and the rest is history . he is doing well , playing for the national###team and is still young .
a federal###judge in california has ordered immigration courts in three states to provide legal###representation for immigrants with mental###disabilities who are in detention and facing deportation , if they cannot represent themselves . the decision is the first time a court has required the government to provide legal###assistance for any group of people before the nation 's immigration courts . the ruling by judge dolly m . gee , of federal court for the central###district###of###california , in los###angeles , was handed down late tuesday in a class###action###lawsuit brought in 2010 by the american###civil###liberties###union , among other groups . one plaintiff in the case is jos###antonio franco gonz###lez , 33 , an immigrant who was detained for more than five years after his deportation case was closed , because severe mental###retardation prevented him from arguing for himself in court or even understanding his situation . on monday , federal immigration officials issued a new policy that would , in practice , expand the california ruling nationwide , making government paid legal###representation available to people with mental###disabilities in immigration courts in every state . the release of that policy indicates that the justice###department , which runs the immigration courts , broadly accepts the approach ordered by judge gee . the new practice is an unprecedented expansion of protections for people appearing before the immigration courts , lawyers and federal officials said . unlike in the criminal###courts , immigrants facing deportation or other proceedings do not have a right to a lawyer provided by the government , if they cannot afford to pay for one . children , including those who are not accompanied by family members , and people with mental###disabilities must represent themselves to fight deportation before immigration judges if they do not have private lawyers . it is the first step in recognizing that , given the complexity of our immigration laws , it is not appropriate to force a vulnerable population through the system without appointed###counsel , laura l . lichter , president of the american###immigration###lawyers###association , said wednesday . judge gee also ordered immigration courts in the three states arizona , california and washington to offer bail hearings for immigrants with mental###disabilities who have been detained for more than six months . the judge said her order should take effect immediately , because without it , mentally###disabled immigrants could not fairly participate in removal###proceedings and could be exposed to prolonged detention without adequate###representation . the federal###government has long taken the position that it does not have to provide representation for anyone in immigration court and that has now been rejected by the court , said ahilan arulanantham of the american###civil###liberties###union immigrants' rights project , one of the lawyers who brought the lawsuit . with counsel , these mentally###disabled immigrants will not only have the chance to present their best cases on why they should not be deported , said michael h . steinberg , a lawyer at sullivan###cromwell who worked on the case as a volunteer . they will also have a chance to fight for release under bond . mr . franco is an immigrant from mexico who does not know his age , and cannot tell time or remember telephone numbers , according to court documents . detained for deportation in april , mr . franco was shuffled for five years among immigration###detention centers in california without a hearing to determine whether he presented a safety risk or was mentally###competent to face an immigration judge . mr . franco had to represent himself even though a psychiatrist had determined he did not understand the proceedings . the class###action case started after a chance###encounter between mr . franco and a lawyer for public counsel , another nonprofit group bringing the lawsuit . under judge gee 's order , the immigration courts could provide representation by lawyers , by students participating in law###school clinics , or by the immigration system 's equivalent of a paralegal . while there are no precise numbers of how many mentally###disabled immigrants would be affected by the new policy , lawyers estimated it could be several thousand people a year . under the new guidelines by the executive###office for immigration review , the justice###department branch in charge of the courts , immigration judges will be able to order mental competency hearings for immigrants who , based on medical or other records , may have serious disorders . the judge can order legal###assistance for an immigrant at government expense , said lauren alder reid , a spokeswoman for the immigration office . at the request of the obama administration , a bipartisan bill before the senate to overhaul the immigration system includes provisions to provide lawyers to young unaccompanied###children and the mentally###disabled in immigration court . justice officials have argued that although the federal###government would have new costs to pay for legal###assistance , the measures would save###money over all by reducing expensive prolonged detention for disabled immigrants .
kissimmee , fla . radio###broadcasts of baseball games have filled the summer air for generations with plain spoken voices of announcers leisurely walking their listeners through nine innings . now this piece of americana one sided conversations that create a cozy intimacy between fans and announcers is colliding with the cold calculations known as sabermetrics . statistical###analysis has swept through baseball over the past decade , becoming part of the fabric of the game and an object of growing fascination to its fans . as players , managers and front office executives embrace the esoteric statistics , teams increasingly want their radio###announcers just as fluent in the language of war , vorp and b.a.b.i.p . ( those stand for wins###above###replacement , value over replacement###player and batting###average on balls in play , for those of you dusting off your radios as the season begins . ) they wanted a broadcaster who is at least comfortable with exploring the idea of discussing advanced statistics and what they mean , said robert###ford , 33 , who was hired by the houston###astros in the off season , along with steve sparks , 48 , a former pitcher , to call the team 's games . the advent of advanced statistical###analysis , mr . ford said , has changed the way we think about baseball . now , as the two settle into the astros' broadcast booth , they and their colleagues across the country face a balancing###act . how much do listeners want to know about these advanced numbers ? how much is informative ? and how much would prompt the audience , a group that spans all generations , to tune out ? listeners and announcers alike say that striking the right balance will be a challenge . when the astros interviewed mr . sparks , a journeyman knuckleball pitcher , and mr . ford , a bronx native who previously###called minor###league games , the topic of advanced statistics came up repeatedly . the astros , who have eagerly embraced analytics , wanted to know if the broadcasters could grasp the data being used , in part , to build the team . we need them to tell the story of how we are making###decisions and putting the organization together , said george postolos , the astros' president and chief###executive , who added that the team would not want a broadcaster who was uncomfortable explaining the front office 's strategy . to prepare for the season , mr . sparks prepared a stack of handwritten###notes on opposing###teams . each page is crammed with statistics . for father 's day last year , his 19 year old daughter bought him a copy of the book , a statistical exploration of the game . i 'm trying to learn as much about sabermetrics as i can , he said . mark patterson , a 27 year old fan sitting in the stands for a recent tampa###bay###rays spring###training game , said he would like to hear more advanced statistical###analysis but said it should be a slow###introduction process . it takes a while to get everything down , mr . patterson said as he and a friend , warren allen , 28 , waited for the game to start . in the rays' lineup that afternoon was ben###zobrist , who may not be a staple of the highlight shows but who has become a well known figure for fans of sabermetrics , a word derived from the abbreviation for the society###for###american###baseball###research . over the past four years , mr . zobrist has led baseball in war , ahead of stars like albert###pujols , ryan###braun and robinson cano . mr . zobrist 's achievement in the war category a measure of a player 's offensive and defensive contributions relative to others who play his position and could replace him was noted in the rays pregame notes given to members of the news###media . mr . patterson and mr . allen seemed to appreciate the recognition for mr . zobrist , who has also led the american###league in a more traditional category over the past four years walks . the advanced numbers , mr . allen said , are how you become aware of players like zobrist who are n't in commercials but still are great###players . to fans like these two , the metrics have become crucial to how they view the game , study it , enjoy it and how they pick players in their fantasy leagues .
denver television###commercials have already run suggesting that buying health###coverage through the state 's new insurance market , connect for health colorado , will feel like winning the world###series . the market 's employees are traveling the state to explain how it will work , often in electric yellow t shirts with the message , got insurance ? in the coming###weeks , 400 guides will be trained to help the uninsured sign up for coverage , with some targeting groups like hispanics , gay and lesbian citizens , and even truckers . this is colorado , five months before the central provisions of president###obama 's health###care law take effect a hive of preparation , with a homegrown insurance market working###closely with state###agencies and lawmakers to help ensure the law 's success . gov . john w . hickenlooper , a democrat , is a firm supporter , and the state legislature , controlled by democrats , has not thrown up any obstacles . when the legislature voted to allow a state based insurance market in , republicans controlled the house of representatives , but many supported the bill , contending that it would give colorado more control over how the health###care law played out here . this spring , state###lawmakers voted along party lines to approve an expansion of medicaid , which is encouraged but not required under the law . the law does have opponents in colorado , but they can do little to stop the democrats from carrying it out . in february , republicans even helped kill a bill that would have repealed the law allowing the insurance market . there 's politics everywhere these days , mr . hickenlooper said in an interview , but for the most part , we 've really been focused on how to do this right , and trying to make sure that people have affordable###health###care . connect for health has received about 180 million in federal money to be up and running by oct . 1 and to cover the first year 's operating###costs . much of the work involves building the web###portal through which people who do not get insurance through their job can buy coverage . colorado residents will be able to shop for insurance plans and compare them on www . connectforhealthco . com , and determine whether they qualify for federal###subsidies to help with the cost . the portal has to be able to exchange information in real time with insurance###companies , state###agencies and the federal###government , which is building a data hub through which it can verify income and citizenship . contractors have almost completed work on the portal , said patty fontneau , executive###director of connect for health . testing is under way to make sure it will function properly when it opens for business in just two months . will it be perfect ? ms . fontneau said . unlikely , but we have the right team in place to ensure that we 're going to be open and running , and as close to perfect as could be , on oct . 1 . connect for health has announced which insurers want to sell plans through the market more than a dozen companies , including most of the state 's biggest insurers and their proposed rates . colorado 's division of insurance will announce the final rates this month . the biggest remaining task is letting roughly , 000 uninsured coloradans know the new marketplace exists , and persuading those who qualify to buy coverage through it . that is what the ads are for , and what people like jessica dunbar are spending most of their time trying to do . she is the individual market manager at connect for health , and her job is getting the word out . ms . dunbar spent one evening explaining the law 's basics and how the market will work , to a small###group at the central###park recreation###center in denver . we 're trying to connect people to a healthier way of life through secure health###insurance###coverage , she said , encouraging her audience to share###stories of why insurance matters to them . she told them about connect for health 's web###site and explained how to use a calculator on the site to find out how big a subsidy they might qualify for . doretta tootle , 41 , said afterward that ms . dunbar had cleared up most of her confusion about the law . but after hearing some sample rates 186 to 357 a month for a 40 year old living in denver ms . tootle was worried that plans sold through the marketplace would be out of her reach , even with a subsidy . i was like , 'that 's expensive ! ' said ms . tootle , adding that she made less than , 000 a year . still , she said , she knows many people who need insurance and wants to help spread the word . i totally understand now , she said , almost to the point where i want to go put this on facebook and let everyone know , 'hey , there 's something coming out . ' connect for health needs that kind of enthusiasm to spread , and fast . at a brainstorming session , members of an outreach advisory###group suggested contests for designing t shirts and posters to advertise the marketplace , and apps to explain how it works . state officials were among those tossing out ideas vincent plymell , a spokesman for the division of insurance , suggested having games for children at promotional###events so that parents could focus on learning about connect for health . mr . hickenlooper said he would lend his voice to the publicity campaign if people thought it would help , adding that he was nervous as a cat about making sure the marketplace succeeded . we 'll do whatever it takes , he said . i 'll ride around the state on a bicycle if i have to .
minneapolis it was n't a bad pitch , but it was n't the right pitch . matt###harvey realized that not long after minnesota 's justin###morneau swung at an inside slider with two out in the seventh , pulling a home###run high off the right field pole and halting harvey 's bid for a second mets no###hitter in two years and his first professional shutout . i was blowing it foul , harvey said . i knew he hit it pretty well . if it was going anywhere , it was going out . for someone making just his 13th major###league start , harvey , 24 , handled his disappointment with surprising poise and determination . he calmly asked for a new ball before morneau had finished circling the bases . after a brief mound visit from third baseman david###wright , harvey retired ryan###doumit on a ground###ball to end the inning . harvey allowed a hit in the eighth , his last inning , to win decisively for the third time in three starts , 4 2 . that impressed wright as much as harvey 's remarkable statistics through three starts . in 22 innings , he has allowed six hits and two earned###runs while striking out , with a . 82 earned###run###average . harvey struck out six on saturday , his fewest in a game , and walked two , wright most liked how he regrouped without blowing a three run lead . that confirmed wright 's feeling that harvey could be special . a lot of guys , especially young pitchers , would have been upset and tried to throw the ball 100 miles an hour , wright said . you walk a guy , give up a hit , all of a sudden you 're in trouble and in jeopardy of losing the game . he showed why he 's becoming an elite , front line type starter . it 's impressive . relying largely on his four###seam###fastball and sinker , harvey dominated on a 35 degree and overcast afternoon marginally better than friday###night 's snowswept chillfest . bobby parnell earned his first save while allowing a run in the ninth . the mets scored all four runs in the fifth , stringing together seven consecutive hits , one short of the club###record . marlon###byrd broke a scoreless###tie with a leadoff homer into the second deck in left off the twins left hander scott diamond , making his first start after having elbow surgery in december . singles by collin cowgill , daniel###murphy and wright also drove in runs , with only murphy 's hit leaving the infield . by then , everyone in the mets' dugout knew what harvey had going . the mets waited a major###league record , 019 games for johan###santana to pitch the team 's first no###hitter on june . would harvey throw the second a mere 121 games later ? when you go through that lineup two times and they do n't have a hit yet , you know he 's got the kind of stuff to go through them a third time , too , manager terry###collins said . blowing into his right hand frequently , harvey allowed only two base###runners through five innings , walking doumit in the second and josh###willingham in the fourth . wright made the only difficult defensive###play , charging a slow roller by willingham in the first and throwing him out easily from third base . no one needed to tell harvey what was going on . i peeked a couple of times , he said . i knew all the guys were making plays . the biggest###thing was blocking out that there were n't any hits and to keep doing what i was doing , and the guys were going to make the plays . harvey breezed through the sixth###inning , striking out brian dozier on a sinker and eduardo escobar on a 96 m.p.h . four###seam###fastball , both swinging . aaron hicks , an . 049 hitting rookie , fought off a two strike pitch by flying to left###field , where lucas###duda stumbled before making the catch heading toward the line . through six , harvey had thrown 76 pitches . collins said he and the pitching coach dan warthen had a pitch limit in mind he would not reveal it , saying , it does n't matter now but they agreed to give harvey leeway if he still had a no###hitter into the ninth . catcher john###buck figured the seventh would be critical with the three time batting###champion joe###mauer , willingham and morneau , a former american###league###most###valuable###player , due up . mauer and willingham both grounded out weakly . morneau 's at bat , that 's the at bat i felt like we needed to get past , just because you have the righties coming up after that , and some of the younger , less experienced guys , buck said . if you want to shoot for it , that would be the recipe to do it . the first three pitches , a curve and two sliders , produced three foul###balls . after morneau took two pitches to even the count at , harvey tried another slider . morneau 's bat made contact with such a loud crack that the crowd , announced as , 804 but likely much smaller , uttered a mix of gasps and groans . i was talking to it 'keep hooking , keep hooking , ' buck said . i could tell as i was looking up it was n't hooking , unless it knuckled at the end . i was talking to it , but it did n't###listen . morneau was our nemesis today , and it showed . there 's a reason that guy is an all star . we threw the same pitch that he fouled off into the dugout . afterwards , we both looked at each other and said , 'changeup ? ' we both agree . harvey said we had gone in there three or four times . looking back , probably should have gone with another changeup or a fastball . collins suspects harvey will get more chances . if he throws like he did today , under the conditions today , it 's just going to get better , he said . terry###collins started . 130 hitting collin cowgill in center###field because he was 3 for 3 against scott diamond . ... an ominous forecast for sunday rain all day , according to collins could force the mets to return here for a makeup game later in the season .
( reuters ) louis###van###gaal has restored his reputation by leading the netherlands into the world###cup###finals , a decade after failing in the same competition with a highly###rated team . the 62 year old coach delivered the dutch to next year 's finals in brazil on tuesday when they made sure of top place in group d with a 2 0 win in andorra their seventh triumph in eight qualifiers . the success puts van###gaal back among the coaching elite after he had to spend years rebuilding his reputation following the failure to qualify for the 2002 finals . van###gaal had been expected to deliver for the dutch in 2002 with a talent laden team at the peak of their powers . they had been european###championship semifinalists in 2000 and included edgar###davids , patrick###kluivert , clarence###seedorf , ruud###van###nistelrooy and edwin###van###der###sar . the team finished behind portugal and the republic of ireland in their qualifying###group , however , to tumble out in disappointing fashion . van###gaal , who had built his name on multiple successes at ajax###amsterdam and barcelona , resigned after less than two years in the national###team job . his long###path to redemption came via a spell at provincial club az###alkmaar whom he led to the dutch title in , breaking a 27 year monopoly on the championship held by the country 's trio of top teams ajax , feyenoord and psv###eindhoven . he went on to win the bundesliga in a colourful spell at bayern###munich before making a surprise return to the dutch job last year , after the team had lost all three matches at euro 2012 in ukraine . van###gaal preferred not to dwell on the past on tuesday . asked by reporters about the contrast with , he replied i find that no smear on my career . i 'm working now with a totally different group , he told sbs6 television . i am building a very young team with a few older###players . you must think back to the team i had to take over . to form a new team is always difficult and especially after such a disappointing european###championship but we have done well to qualify as the first country from europe and with a goal###difference of plus . in brazil we want to achieve , he added . it 's a once in a lifetime experience . at a tournament like the world###cup , being the national###coach is an exceptional job .
lutherville , md . the day he lost his job , cam###cameron decided to go to his son###danny 's high###school basketball game . as soon as cameron arrived at the gymnasium , he could sense that people were staring at him . it struck him as pity , or perhaps morbid curiosity . people were numb because they think you should run and hide , he said . they think you 're embarrassed . i 've got nothing to be embarrassed about . until dec . 10 , cameron occupied a high###profile position as the offensive###coordinator of the baltimore###ravens . then he was fired , and the ravens began to thrive without him . the team 's remarkable postseason run will culminate in a super###bowl appearance against the san###francisco 49ers . some in the punditry business have cited cameron 's firing as a catalyst for the team 's success . if you think this annoys him , think again . it was a brilliant move , cameron said wednesday at his home outside baltimore . everyone on the team took a look in the mirror after that . cameron , 51 , said he learned long###ago that being fired was part of football . at this stage of his career , he has a dispassionate view of his profession . in his den , he has a framed photograph of his stepfather , tom harp , when he was an assistant###coach at army in . in the photo , harp is standing next to earl###blaik , the legendary###coach known as red , and pete###dawkins , the heisman###trophy winning halfback . army went undefeated that season . harp later worked as a head###coach at cornell , duke and indiana###state , with varying###degrees of success . cameron said he could remember when his stepfather was fired for the first time . as a kid , you live it , he said . the demands on coaches to win , and win now have only grown in recent###years , cameron said . he said coaches once viewed preseason###games as opportunities to work on fundamentals and evaluate young###players nothing more . now , after one preseason###game , people are wanting to know what 's wrong with the offense , he said . cameron has had his share of success . an acolyte of the longtime###coach don###coryell , whose high octane passing###attack continues to influence the modern game , cameron directed one of the highest###scoring offenses in n.f.l . history in 2006 with the san###diego###chargers . after one dismal###season as the head###coach of the miami###dolphins , he joined the ravens as the offensive###coordinator in 2008 and helped joe###flacco develop into one of the league 's top young quarterbacks . this season , the ravens' offense was not exactly scuffling with cameron at the helm . when he was dismissed , the team was , having lost two straight###games , and averaging . 4 yards of offense . under jim###caldwell , who was promoted from quarterbacks###coach , the ravens have averaged . 2 yards including . 7 yards per game in the playoffs . cameron said the change made a difference not so much because of any schematic overhauls , but because it put everyone in the organization on alert . we were inconsistent , cameron said , and if i 'm in charge , i 'm saying 'why are we inconsistent ? we need to get the team 's attention . ' as center matt###birk put it , it 's not like we changed everything we were doing . on dec . 10 , the day after the ravens lost to the washington###redskins in overtime , cameron arrived at the team 's practice facility at 4 a.m . about an hour earlier than usual , he said . he could tell something was brewing , he said , though nobody had told him anything . you can tell in decision###makers' eyes , in their body###language , cameron said . coach john###harbaugh invited cameron to meet in his office . the conversation was brief , cameron said , with harbaugh essentially telling cameron that the team needed to make a change . harbaugh later called it his most difficult###decision as a head###coach . cameron said he told harbaugh that he understood . the two men hugged , and cameron said he wished harbaugh luck before leaving the building . with time on his hands , cameron pieced###together a list of activities that he never had the chance to do while he was pulling 16 hour###days as a coach . he drove his three youngest###children to school . ( his oldest , tom , is a freshman at fordham . ) he went to the gym with his wife , missy . he golfed . he fished . he took a bowhunting trip to ohio with his 14 year old son , chris . i said , 'i want to see what all this feels like , ' cameron recalled . when he visited new york with his wife to see a couple of broadway shows , he could feel the sting of unemployment beginning to fade , he said . he found an irish pub where he watched the ravens' divisional###playoff victory over the denver###broncos . he said he had invested too much in the team to let himself feel bitter or unhappy . you ca n't do anything but root for those guys , he said . he wants to coach again , he said , and plans to next season . he still loves the game . he interviewed with the jets for their offensive###coordinator position , but was turned down . when you 're in this situation , cameron said , you have to build yourself up a little bit . he recalled the message that linebacker ray###lewis gave the ravens after their playoff###loss to the patriots last season . he said we were right where we were supposed to be , cameron said . i believed that then , and i believe it today . i do n't###necessarily understand it . but i believe that me and my family and i 've told them this we 're right where we 're supposed to be . and that 's very freeing in a lot of ways .
atlanta a tennessee national###guard recruiter wounded two of his superiors on thursday when he opened fire with a handgun at a military facility near memphis , the authorities said . other employees at the paul r . summers armory in millington , tenn . , immediately overpowered the assailant , probably preventing more bloodshed , the police said . i 'm sure there could have been more injured if they had n't taken him into custody , said chief rita stanback of the millington police . the authorities did not release the identities of the gunman , a sergeant first class , or the victims . but maj . gen . terry m . haston , the adjutant###general of the tennessee national###guard , said all three were men who worked as recruiters . the victims , a major and a sergeant###major , were in the chain of command of their attacker , who is expected to face###charges in a civilian court . the men , who were each shot once in their lower###extremities , were being treated at the regional###medical###center at memphis and were expected to recover . although federal###investigators were just beginning their inquiry on thursday###evening , chief gary graves of the millington fire department said in a telephone interview that the episode appeared to be an isolated###incident with regards to personnel . there was no immediate evidence of a breach of security protocols related to the shooting , which prompted a short lockdown at the nearby naval support activity mid###south . general haston said that everything was followed according to textbook . coming less than six weeks after a gunman killed 12 people at the washington###navy###yard , thursday 's episode clearly rattled officials in millington , a city of more than , 000 people . we were kind of hoping it was going to be a drill when we first got the call , chief stanback said . general haston said the shooting had stunned him . you never think that something like this is going to happen on your watch or in good old tennessee here .
gullane , scotland move over ryo###ishikawa , asian golf finally has a new star . with two wins on the japanese tour this year and an unexpected 10th place###finish at last month 's u.s . open , hideki###matsuyama is carrying the hopes of japan and the rest of asia heading into his first british###open . not an easy task for a player who turned###professional only in april . but matsuyama is taking everything in stride . as far as taking over from ishikawa , i have n't even thought of that , said matsuyama , ranked no . 44 to make him asia 's leading golfer . all i 'm doing is trying to play the best golf that i can , gain the experience that i need . fearless and always sharply dressed , ishikawa blew onto the scene in 2007 after winning his first tournament at age 15 and , two years later , became the youngest###player to enter the world 's top . the major title that many predicted would quickly arrive never came , though . his presence on the pga###tour has given him more exposure , but he is dropping steadily down the rankings , from no . 64 this time last year to a current no . 153 . that puts him only 13th in asia . there are eight japanese players at muirfield this week . ishikawa is n't one of them . it 's fellow 21 year old matsuyama , last year 's top amateur , who is starting to hog the limelight even more so now that he has been grouped with phil###mickelson and rory###mcilroy for his first two rounds . those who have followed his progress closely struggle to find a weakness in matsuyama 's game . charming and polite just like ishikawa he has a bigger frame and a wide smile . but out on the course , he is ruthless . he announced himself to the world by making the cut at his first two masters , in 2011 and ' , but his game has soared since turning###pro . seven top 10 finishes in eight japanese tour events , including two wins and two runner###ups , and that great showing at merion on the toughest stage of all . the finish at the u.s . open did a lot for my confidence , matsuyama said , knowing that i can play on the world stage . playing at muirfield will further his education , especially considering his partners thursday and friday , who have won six majors between them . matsuyama has turned to compatriot shigeki###maruyama , who finished one shot off the leaders in a tie for fifth at muirfield in , for advice about how to tackle the challenges of links golf this week . he has had to reinvent his game , the low shots off the tee and the running approaches to the greens . he is a long driver , but he may have to rein that in on the fast and fiery tracks . i 've never played on a course with harder fairways or harder greens , he said . so it 's been an adventure and a great###learning experience for me .
this is the game of the year in the pacific , and its implications will be felt far beyond the west###coast . oregon quarterback marcus###mariota is the heisman front runner and has yet to lose a game or throw an interception this season . his last defeat and his last interception came in the ducks' 17 14 overtime###loss to stanford last season . that upset kept oregon out of the bowl###championship###series title game and helped stanford reach the rose bowl for the first time in 13 years . stanford did a great job of disrupting oregon 's timing on offense by disguising coverage schemes , penetrating up front and making tackles in the backfield . the loss was the only time the ducks scored fewer than 35 points last season . cardinal players showed discipline and seemed to make every tackle . to win again , they will have to repeat that performance . it will not help that the senior defensive###end ben gardner is out for the season with a torn chest muscle . the pressure will be on linebacker trent murphy to keep an eye on mariota , who has thrown for 20 touchdowns and run for . oregon running back de'anthony###thomas provided some bulletin###board material when he said , we should at least put up 40 points . it is worth###noting , however , that 40 would be the ducks' lowest output of the season . oregon is favored despite playing on the road . look for the ducks to avenge last season 's loss . baylor 's offense has been dynamic this season , but it has neither faced a ranked###opponent nor seen a defense as good as oklahoma 's . the bears lead the nation with averages of . 9 points and . 4 total###yards , and bryce petty has emerged as a heisman contender . he is a big pro style quarterback who is putting up impressive###numbers . a win against the sooners could go a long way toward securing petty an invitation to new york for the heisman ceremony . oklahoma 's lone loss came against rival texas the sooners were two touchdown favorites . oklahoma bounced back with a high scoring win over previously###undefeated texas###tech last week . the defending big 12 champion , oklahoma is 21 1 in its series against baylor . ( robert###griffin###iii was the quarterback for the bears' lone victory . ) the sooners will probably use a grinding running###game to try to keep the bears' offense off the field . a lot will depend on the improvement of baylor 's defense . traditionally a weakness , the unit is ranked 11th in the nation , allowing 316 yards per game . this matchup is in waco , tex . , so expect a crazy atmosphere for one of the biggest home###football###games in baylor history .
berlin borussia moenchengladbach have agreed a four year contract with dynamo###kiev attacking###midfielder raffael pending a medical check next week , the bundesliga club said on thursday . the 28 year old brazilian , who returned to the bundesliga after the winter###break last season on loan at schalke , will officially be presented on monday after his medical . we now have another flexible and skilled player in attack , said gladbach sports###director max eberl in a club statement . it was not an easy transfer but we are delighted that it worked out . financial###details of the deal were not given . raffael also played under current gladbach coach lucien###favre at fc zurich and hertha###berlin . i have to thank him for a lot of things , raffael said . he developed me in zurich and then brought me to berlin . now i want to pay back that trust . gladbach just missed out on the european spots last season , finishing###in###eighth###place in the bundesliga .
kaufman , tex . soon after one of his prosecutors was shot and killed here in january , the district###attorney in this rural county outside dallas , mike mclelland , told colleagues that he believed the victim was the target of a specific disgruntled defendant whom his office had successfully###prosecuted . eight weeks later , early on a saturday at the end of march , a gunman or gunmen entered mr . mclelland 's red brick home and shot him and his wife multiple###times . in the days after the couple were killed , investigators have been increasingly focusing on the theory that mr . mclelland himself had initially embraced that whoever was responsible had a grudge against the district###attorney 's office and was either a defendant or affiliated with one . law###enforcement officials have been exploring the possibility that the three killings of mr . mclelland , 63 , and his wife , cynthia , 65 , as well as the assistant###district###attorney , mark e . hasse , 57 were the work of a local person seeking to avenge some case or investigation and to make a dramatic statement by attacking those at the center of the kaufman###county criminal###justice system . investigators have been cooling to the notion that the shootings were the work of a prison###gang , the aryan###brotherhood of texas , or of mexican drug###cartels , and focusing more on what officials described as lone wolf figures defendants and those even closer to the victims , including current or former county employees who work or used to work within the local###courts . the aryan###brotherhood theory has been losing some steam , one law enforcement official said , speaking on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to talk about the investigation . officials said it was possible that the mclellands might even have known their attacker , since there were no signs of forced###entry in their home . some law###enforcement officials said ms . mclelland might have opened the front door that morning or the couple might have briefly###left it unlocked . the killer or killers may have even had a key to the house , they said . the assault on the mclellands' home was particularly brazen . mr . mclelland , a 23 year army veteran , was a regular at a gun###shop near his home , browsing for firearms and chatting up the owner two or three times a week . and he kept five to six dozen different types of firearms at his residence , many of them loaded , according to two law###enforcement officials . there were guns hidden all over the house , said mr . mclelland 's son , j . r . mclelland , 39 . behind doors , everywhere . he could have been standing next to a . 40 caliber glock and you would not have known it . when they said that he got shot , it was unbelievable because he was so well armed and so well versed in guns . it was unclear why mr . mclelland and his wife she was also comfortable with a firearm , and she had a license to carry a concealed handgun did not have immediate access to the guns in the house when the killer or killers entered . law###enforcement officials have not publicly linked the hasse and mclelland killings and have not identified a suspect or motive in either case , but they have been operating under the theory that the crimes were connected . they said that they were continuing to follow various leads and that , at this point , none of the theories they have developed were off the table . but they have grown wary of a connection to the aryan###brotherhood of texas , which also has members and associates outside of prison , because investigators believe the white###supremacist gang would not jeopardize its drug###trafficking profits by assassinating two prosecutors . in addition , the gang appears to value money over ideology , and investigators believe that members and associates would have snitched on one another to get the , 000 reward for information in the case . less than an hour after mr . hasse was shot on jan . 31 in an employee parking###lot near the county###courthouse in kaufman , mr . mclelland called his staff together . they crowded into the chapel at texas health presbyterian hospital , where mr . hasse was rushed after the attack .
the 2012 13 season of new###york###city###ballet that ended at the david h . koch theater was a milestone in several ways . at age , peter###martins , the ballet###master in chief , has weathered 30 years at its helm . he may well end up lasting###longer than the 35 years enjoyed by the company 's founding ballet###master , george###balanchine . in the past year mr . martins has also presented three world###premieres by a new choreographer , justin peck . all of them in creases , year of the rabbit and paz de la###jolla are at least good and rabbit really does seem to be the most exciting new ballet since alexei###ratmansky 's concerto dsch . mr . martins 's 30th season , more than most , also showed how puzzling a figure he is . as a ballet###master he directs the company 's teaching , the choice of each season 's repertory from its unmatched treasury of ballets by balanchine and jerome###robbins , and the way those ballets are rehearsed and cast . he decides which choreographers are to make each season 's several premieres , which dancers are to join the ranks and which are to be promoted . in each of these departments it 's easy and often right to find serious fault with him . and yet many of the world 's most remarkable dance performances occur under his watch . the number of bad ballets he has commissioned has been high . nevertheless , it 's for his city ballet that christopher###wheeldon and alexei###ratmansky , the most in demand ballet choreographers today , have made their finest work . this is unlikely to be an accident . we keep waiting for these men to surpass their best city ballet creations elsewhere mr . wheeldon is in residence at the royal###ballet in london , mr . ratmansky at american###ballet###theater but so far that has n't###happened . now the company has produced mr . peck too . mr . martins has long been castigated as a choreographer . all too many of his pieces are both heartless and sketchy . during may and june , though , four of his ballets calcium light night , barber violin concerto , river of light ( 1998 ) and hallelujah junction ( 2001 ) rewarded our attention and stimulated dancers . true , all his work feels merely professional and efficient but there 's much he knows about dance making that several far better choreographers have never learned . he can give wings to an important individual dancer his pas###de###deux can be occasions for real drama his uses of stage geometries and light can be potent . what 's more , those four martins ballets and two of mr . peck 's were given to american scores . ( and the other mr . peck 's most recent work , paz de la###jolla is to a score that the czech composer bohuslav martinu wrote in california . ) american music has been a martins policy all along . the company 's 1988 american music###festival seemed laden with objectionable premieres at the time yet it was commemorated this spring . twenty five years on , mr . martins can point to a string of ballets on which he and other company choreographers have worked with american###composers john###adams , michael###torke , charles###wuorinen and now sufjan###stevens , whose music mr . peck employs in rabbit . policy or gimmick ? the martins regime has been widely accused of gimmickry . if the choreographer mark###morris were to present an american music###festival i hope one day he does it would self evidently be a statement of belief he 's made many of his most imaginative works to music by virgil###thomson , henry###cowell , lou###harrison and others . by contrast , mr . martins 's works to american music never seem driven by conviction . yet even if american music is one of mr . martins 's attention###grabbing devices , now we have mr . peck choreographing fresh , vital , skilled pieces to scores by mr . stevens and philip###glass . all three peck ballets seem to be views of american people in american space . so why will only one of these peck works ( rabbit ) be revived in the 2013 14 season ? and why for only two shows ? it 's good that mr . peck will also make a new work to a commissioned score by mr . stevens but more familiarity with these recent peck creations would help us all . in his 20s , he 's still dancing a range of corps and solo roles nobody wants him to be overburdened with commissions . but in creases , despite its ill advised costumes , is a piece many of us long to know better . mr . martins 's policies are at their most perplexing in the way the company dances balanchine . it 's baffling that several dancers megan fairchild , rebecca krohn , ask la###cour , abi stafford and jonathan stafford were made principals . useful executants , they 're not remotely authoritative . they neither own their own space nor light up the space beyond themselves . ( i would add the generally bland ana sophia scheller to that list but for the lan she brought to the embraceable you role of who cares ? on friday . ) in this season 's best performances , four highly###individual ballerinas sterling hyltin , sara###mearns , tiler peck , and teresa reichlen kept extending their range , reaching new peaks of musicality , stage artistry and individual###style . among the company 's men , robert fairchild has become one of the most lovable and impressive dancers in america . among the company 's other men , the young chase finlay a principal since february is evidently still learning , but his blend of seriousness , bloom , nobility and amplitude make him continually eye###catching . but is there a single woman beneath principal rank who could light up balanchine 's most exalted roles ? these roles depict elusive , independent , challenging and inspiring women . yet for the women in the city ballet of mr . martins , few hurdles are harder than the task of shaking off girlishness . he allows a handful of them to grow into true artists , but elsewhere he gives us a company in which many dancers inhabit a state of perpetually arrested###development . after 30 years it seems unlikely that mr . martins wants it otherwise .
like ocean waters around the world , the chesapeake has become more and more acidic as a result of rising levels of carbon###dioxide in the atmosphere . now , by studying oyster populations in relation to acidity levels , a team of researchers has concluded that oysters particularly their shells can play a significant###role in reducing that acidity . oyster shells are made out of calcium###carbonate , so they 're sort of like an antacid pill , said george waldbusser , an assistant###professor of earth , ocean and atmospheric###sciences at oregon###state and an author of the study , which appears in the journal ecology . in an undisturbed oyster reef , healthy oysters are generating a lot of biodeposits , a genteel term for excrement , which helps generate co to help break down those shells , which helps to regenerate the alkalinity back into the environment . since the industrial###revolution , ocean acidity has increased by about 30 percent , researchers say , and it is on track to double by . among the dangers of highly###acidic waters are damage to fish larvae and corrosion of mollusk shells , which means the oysters in this case are helping themselves . it creates a positive###feedback###loop , dr . waldbusser said . programs to replenish chesapeake oyster reefs mainly to filter out pollution and combat overharvesting date to the 1960s . but the researchers say larger , older oysters should be introduced at a faster###rate to fend off the rising acidity .
even before leading the united###states in a difficult first round group at next year 's world###cup , jurgen klinsmann has been signed to stay on as the american coach for the 2018 world###cup . the u.s . soccer federation said thursday that klinsmann has agreed to a four year contract extension through . klinsmann replaced bob###bradley as the american national###team###coach in july 2011 and his new deal gives him the additional title of ussf technical###director . one of the reasons we hired jurgen as our head###coach was to advance the program forward , and we 've seen the initial###stages of that happening on the field and also off the field in various areas , ussf president sunil###gulati said in a statement . in the past two years he has built a strong foundation from the senior###team down to the youth teams , and we want to continue to build upon that success . the u.s . is 27 10 7 under klinsmann , qualified for its seventh###straight world###cup and won this year 's concacaf###gold###cup , the championship of north and central###america and the caribbean . the americans set###team###records this year for wins , winning###percentage . 761 ) and winning###streak . he said in april he hoped to stay on for another four year cycle but also said the world###cup would be key and his term depends on how the team presents itself , how they play , what really happens in the games . the u.s . was drawn last week into the most difficult first round group for next june 's tournament in brazil , where the americans play ghana , portugal and germany . i am very fortunate to continue the work we started more than two and half years###ago , klinsmann said in a statement . the role of technical###director is a huge challenge and also a huge opportunity as we look to keep connecting the dots to the youth###national###teams , coaching education , the development academy and the grassroots efforts in this country . after winning the 1990 world###cup with west###germany and the 1996 european###championship with germany , klinsmann retired as a player in 1998 and moved to orange###county , calif . now , klinsmann coached germany to a 20 8 6 record from , leading the team to a third place###finish at home in the 2006 world###cup and then quitting . he coached bayern###munich from july 2008 until he was fired the following april .
kirk###gibson and mark###mcgwire gripped each other 's tops and faced off nose to nose as the nasty brawl escalated . when ian###kennedy hit fellow starter zack###greinke with a pitch and a full on melee broke out between arizona and los###angeles , several stars from another generation were right in the thick of it . take out the baseball cards , kids , it was n't just miguel###montero and yasiel###puig mixing it up . several coaches who dominated the game as players in the 1980s and '90s produced some of the fight 's most memorable###moments . there was mcgwire , los###angeles' hitting coach , clutched in a tense standoff with equally solid diamondbacks third base coach matt williams . big don###baylor , arizona 's hitting coach , held his ground among a surge of dodgers . don###mattingly wrestled someone to the ground as he tried to get at fellow manager gibson . williams had mattingly in a bear###hug at one point . gibson , mcgwire and diamondbacks assistant###hitting###coach turner ward who was nearly thrown over a railing near the arizona dugout were among the six ejected from the game . everything happened so fast , mattingly said . it just gets a little crazy out there . things got out of hand in the seventh###inning of the dodgers' 5 3 victory , when kennedy hit greinke in the shoulder the ball caromed off his helmet . that was payback for greinke hitting catcher miguel###montero in the top of the inning after kennedy hit dodgers rookie yasiel###puig with a ball that caught puig 's nose in the sixth . generally , coaches try to remain peacemakers when benches clear after a player is hit with a pitch . not this time , with two sides full of gritty former players . perhaps best known for his limping trot around the bases after homering to give the dodgers a win in game 1 of the 1988 world###series , gibson refused give in when mcgwire , the former single season home###run record###holder , screamed at the d backs manager . we 're certainly not going to try and jeopardize anybody 's career . we respect those guys too much , gibson said . they responded and it was certainly obvious . and beyond that , things just got out of control . ap sports writer beth harris in los###angeles contributed to this story .
washington ( reuters ) the number of americans filing new claims for unemployment###benefits hit a four month high last week , suggesting that the labor market recovery may have lost some momentum in march . initial claims for state unemployment###benefits increased , 000 to a seasonally adjusted , 000 , the highest###level since november , the labor department said on thursday . it cautioned that the estimate was imprecise because the week included easter . economists , who had expected claims to drop to , 000 , said while the rise partly reflected difficulties adjusting the data during the easter and spring breaks , there was no doubt the pace of job###growth had eased . on friday , the government releases its employment report for march . according to a reuters survey of economists , employers added , 000 jobs to their payrolls last month after hiring , 000 workers in february . the unemployment###rate is seen holding steady at . 7 percent . but a weaker reading is possible after a report from the payroll processor adp showed that private employers added the fewest jobs in five months in march . goldman###sachs expects the economy to have created , 000 jobs last month , noting that the tone of labor market indicators softened in march , especially in light of the so called government sequester , which is cutting 85 billion in spending . the sequester is likely to slow###march payroll growth , and payrolls have outpaced broader measures of labor market improvement over the last few months , said sven jari stehn , an economist at goldman###sachs .
katniss###everdeen as fashion 's it girl ? that 's how the costume###designer trish summerville imagined the teenage warrior portrayed by jennifer###lawrence in the hunger###games catching fire as a previous victor , she must be camera ready as panem prepares for the 75th games . in suzanne###collins 's novels , a deadly competition is staged annually by the wealthy capitol to punish the panem districts over which it rules . the trilogy and the franchise 's first film###adaptation last year set the general tone . but a new team , ms . summerville and the director francis###lawrence , put their own visual imprint on the next one , due nov . 22 . considering how the capitol and panem ingest and digest capitalism and consumerism , and all the parties and galas they go to , they change fashions more quickly than each season , she said . katniss 's outfits gowns of feathers , accessories in rough hewed fibers indicate her ascent in the capitol while evoking her home in the impoverished district . her male comrades , peeta and finnick , received magnetic , matinee###idol looks . and dressing effie trinket required tapping alexander###mcqueen and house of worth for statement pieces , including shoes that forced trinket literally to stay on her toes . i do , i don't for her grand###entrance to the 75th hunger###games kickoff , katniss dons a fantasy wedding###dress by the jakartan designer tex saverio the one she might have worn had her nuptials to peeta not been quashed by the games . i wanted to have a subliminal feel of flames and feathers to keep her the girl on fire while also representing the mockingjay , ms . summerville said . mr . saverio 's froth of layered organza features a flame inspired silver corset and fabric peacock###feathers sprouting at the waist . as katniss twirls , the gown erupts , and an iridescent mockingjay dress rises from the ash . using images of a mockingbird , blue###jay , pheasant and peacock , ms . summerville worked with an illustrator and graphic###designer to create patterns of feathers and wings , which she then had printed on chiffon and built into the mockingjay dress . dyed in the wool katniss wears a one shouldered , cowl neck sweater vest , almost like a shield , over her father 's leather coat . the piece , made by maria dora , a los###angeles knitwear designer , is meant to see katniss through summer , spring and winter . i wanted to bundle her up a bit and give her something that had a feel of the capitol , ms . summerville said , but still with keeping in those nubby , big natural###fibers something , say , her mom could have made for her . like a security blanket , the piece accompanies katniss on her hunting###expeditions and even to bed on the victory tour . it 's trying to marry both sides of her duality , ms . summerville said , having her heart at home but also fitting into the capitol world without selling out . springtime in panem when the capitol escort effie trinket ( elizabeth###banks ) returns to district 12 for the 75th reaping , she is adorned with monarch###butterflies on her dress , an actual alexander###mcqueen couture design her hair even her eyelashes . in her mind , it 's springtime , ms . summerville said . her chrysalis has turned into this butterfly , she gets to come out again , she gets to see the kids . she wanted effie to look uncomfortable . i think it 's her penance to herself , she said , explaining that effie loves all the grandeur , but that she 's also really conflicted about her role in calling the kids up for the reapings . effie 's waist is cinched a little too tightly , her heels are a little too high , and her clothes are nearly impossible to sit###in . man###up this time around we made peeta 's character much more masculine , ms . summerville said . she laughed as she recounted meeting josh###hutcherson , the actor who plays him , and saw how athletic he was . i was like , 'we have to dude you up . ' using jackets and more structured pieces that amped up his already muscular physique , she accentuated his rapid maturation between the first and second films , and hinted at the emotional and sexual allure that drew katniss to him initially . ms . summerville used a lot of subdued greens in peeta 's wardrobe because katniss 's favorite###color is green , she said , so subliminally , he 's always trying to woo her .
daytona###beach , fla . south###korea 's se###ri###pak opened the door for her compatriots with four l.p.g.a . wins and two major championships in , and many wondered if lorena###ochoa would usher in the talents of other mexican women the same way . ochoa made a splash in her 2003 l.p.g.a . rookie###season with eight top 10 finishes and top rookie honors . she went on to collect 27 victories , 63 top three finishes , 109 top 10 finishes and more than . 8 million in career###earnings while securing player of the year honors and posting the tour 's low###scoring average for her final four seasons . single handedly , ochoa put golf on the sports radar of soccer crazy mexico , but after seven seasons , she retired at age 28 in april 2010 and returned###home to focus on starting a family . since ochoa 's prime , only a handful of mexican golfers have earned l.p.g.a . membership . violeta retamoza won once and recorded three runner up finishes on the l.p.g . a 's feeder tour in 2007 to earn full membership in . but retamoza , a former all american at tennessee , said she felt the pressure of following ochoa 's footsteps and being only the second mexican woman to earn full l.p.g.a . status . retamoza struggled in the spotlight in , making the cut only once in 19 tournaments . it was difficult to handle media###scrutiny and comparisons to ochoa 's success . retamoza dropped out of competition , returned###home and now helps young###mexican women pros deal with such pressure . sophia sheridan , ochoa 's childhood###friend , has earned partial l.p.g.a . status four times since 2007 and is one of three mexicans competing in this week 's l.p.g.a . qualifying###tournament for 2014 membership . lorena was so good on a global###scale that everybody back home thinks what she did is normal , so their expectations are huge , said alejandra llaneza , 25 , who is also competing in the qualifying###tournament . we obviously want to get there , and lorena showed us it can happen , but that 's not an easy road for anyone in the world to follow . margarita ramos 's road brought her to the united###states at age 11 to attend the david leadbetter golf academy in florida . she followed her golf coach to augusta , ga . , where she lived with her family for one year , before heading to phoenix , where she played high###school golf at xavier###college preparatory . ramos later enrolled at the university of arizona , ochoa 's alma###mater , and graduated last year . lorena won the n.c.a.a . women 's golf championship while she was at arizona and they have the trophy and pictures of her there , said ramos , who played on the ladies###european###tour this year . it was inspiring . even out of competition , ochoa has continued to reach out to young###mexican women professionals through a nonprofit###organization called impulsando al golf profesional mexicano . each year , she appears at a pro am tournament that raises money to help the mexican women with tournament entry###fees and hotel expenses . the organization also paid the entry###fees , 000 per player for the tournament this week . the organization also has connected with mexico 's national###commission for physical###culture and sport , which has traditionally focused on olympic sports . but with golf returning to the olympics in , the young pros hope to represent mexico at the games . that 's a big motivation and we 're all working###hard , llaneza said . the players also hope good results will spark renewed interest in golf in mexico . since ochoa 's retirement , media interest has waned and less corporate###sponsorship is available for women 's golf . lorena left golf too early to have the same impact that brought the korean golfers after se###ri won , said sheridan , 29 , who played junior golf with ochoa . she added one of us has to earn full l.p.g.a . status this week for the media to become interested again . sheridan gave###birth to a daughter in september 2012 and returned to competition this season , alternating between the l.p.g.a . and the symetra tours . the l.p.g.a . offers child care for playing mothers , but the symetra###tour does not . without full l.p.g.a . status , sheridan had to play qualifying###tournaments to get into some l.p.g.a . events . child care is not available during those early week , 18 hole tournaments . if i do n't have full l.p.g.a . status after this q school , then i 'm done , said sheridan , who played in 11 tournaments this year after her maternity###leave . it 's too hard to plan travel with a child when you have to qualify to get into tournaments . nearly a half###dozen mexicans played on this year 's symetra###tour , and ramos noted that several mexican women play college golf in the united###states . we all look up to what lorena did and knowing that it can be done , we try harder , ramos said . but mexico is still waiting on its next ochoa , and today 's young pros feel that void more than anyone . there are only three of us here this week , but i know there are others behind us on the right track , llaneza said . we want to keep the sport going in mexico .

it 's so hard to say goodbye###to###yesterday . no , honestly it 's practically###impossible , especially in an age of cyclical nostalgia and internet assisted memories . old musical acts have always gone on comeback tours , but these days the disappearances are getting shorter and nostalgia is fully taking its place alongside discovery as a valid aesthetic appreciation strategy . why listen to the new bands that sound like the old bands when the old bands will be back before you know it ? new kids on the block are returning , again , just in time to glower at one direction and the wanted and to make a play for the parents of those groups' fans . the new kids have a new album , 10 , due out in april , but that violates one of the core rules of comebacks do n't dilute the memories . the group should know better . it 's been through a couple of comebacks already . to sweeten the new kids' forthcoming tour menacingly called the package it will be joined by 98 degrees , a boy###band it clearly fathered , and boyz###ii###men , a post boy###band that it predated but probably aspired to be . the three groups invade nassau###coliseum in uniondale , n.y. , on june the izod###center in east###rutherford , n.j. , on june and the barclays###center in brooklyn on june . whatever intra group conflicts the new kids may have had to overcome in order to hit the road successfully and shake down long loyal###fans , they pale in comparison with what 's driven fleetwood###mac to ruin time and again . its reunion shows can be prickly affairs , depending on whether stevie and lindsey are on amenable terms or only barely able to share airspace . every few years the band members huddle back up to test the waters and themselves this time there 's a juicy deluxe###edition of rumours to flog . feel the old tensions , and maybe some new ones , at madison###square###garden on april the prudential###center in newark on april and the nikon###at###jones###beach###theater in wantagh , n.y. , on june 22 fleetwood###mac and new kids on the block are both like party guests you see walk out the door and who then hide out in your garage , waiting to surprise you with their unexpected permanence . swedish###house###mafia , a cobbled together supergroup of arena dance heroes , is insisting on a different ending . the trio axwell , steve###angello , sebastian###ingrosso is splitting after a few years of reshaping the scale of the global dance###music takeover to return to their modest lives as individual dance###music superstars . one last tour this jaunt is called . it plays the hammerstein###ballroom on feb . 28 ( a charity event called the black###tie rave madison###square###garden on march and then three nights , march 2 to , at the barclays###center . after that a few more dates in los###angeles and miami and then , they swear , the end . as if .

philadelphia the chicago###white###sox , enduring their worst season in decades , were eager to trade starter jake###peavy before the trading###deadline this week . the boston###red###sox , hoping for their first playoff###appearance in four years , were eager to acquire him . rick hahn , the chicago general###manager , and ben###cherington , the boston general###manager , had sound baseball reasons for making a deal . but it took the game 's most pressing off field issue to make it happen . we spoke for a long time a long time exhausting direct trades between the white###sox and the red###sox involving jake###peavy , hahn said on wednesday , after the 4 p.m . deadline for trades without waivers . not until the middle of the day yesterday , when it became fairly apparent to both of us it just was n't going to happen , did he suggest to me the notion of garcia in a three way deal . avisail garcia was a promising outfielder hitting . 374 for the detroit###tigers' class aaa###affiliate . the tigers were willing to move him to find a shortstop , because their all star at the position , jhonny###peralta , is facing a suspension for his role in the biogenesis scandal . the punishment is likely to come down this week or early next week , but the tigers do not know the precise###date , and peralta publicly , at least has not decided whether he would appeal . but with a strong###possibility of losing him , the tigers identified jose iglesias of the red###sox as a replacement . with iglesias involved , the rest of the pieces fell into place late tuesday###night peavy went to boston , garcia to chicago and iglesias to detroit with the white###sox also getting three class a prospects from the red###sox , and the tigers sending reliever brayan villarreal to boston . it was the biggest deal in the final###hours before the deadline , and a somewhat sobering sign of the times . jhonny###peralta is our shortstop now , tigers general###manager dave###dombrowski told###reporters in detroit after the trade . i know the natural question is , 'what does that mean for peralta ? ' and right now , under these circumstances , the frank reality is i do not know . i also think that the more we talk about our scenario , if there 's a lengthy suspension in which jhonny does not play and i do not know where that stands we feel that we are now very protected with somebody we like a great deal . the red###sox sold high on iglesias , a slick fielder with poor career offensive###numbers at class###aaa a . 244 average , . 296 on###base###percentage and . 292 slugging###percentage . but he was hitting . 330 for boston this season , helped by 24 infield hits and an unusually###high average on balls in play . although iglesias has been playing third base , he was expendable for the red###sox , who have stephen###drew for the rest of this season and xander bogaerts nearly ready in the minors . the red###sox also could afford the remainder of peavy 's two year , 29 million contract , which runs through . last summer 's bailout trade with the los###angeles###dodgers , which saved almost 260 million , continues to benefit the red###sox . after the peavy trade , deadline day was relatively quiet . the baltimore###orioles acquired another starter for their ever shifting rotation , snagging bud###norris from the houston###astros for outfielder l . j . hoes , a class a pitcher and a draft###choice . the arizona###diamondbacks bolstered their bullpen by trading ian###kennedy , their struggling former ace , to the san###diego###padres for the left hander joe###thatcher , a class###aa pitcher and a draft###choice . more newsworthy , perhaps , were deals not made . the texas###rangers stood pat despite a looming suspension for their all star outfielder , nelson###cruz . so did the philadelphia###phillies , who are far behind the atlanta###braves in the national###league###east but seem reluctant to break up an aging , brittle core . there has been a drop off in the talent level , philadelphia general###manager ruben amaro said . i 'm not delusional to say there has n't been . but i do believe we still have the talent level if we keep it on the field more consistently to be a contending club . to that end , amaro held onto the veteran infielders chase###utley and michael###young , who are facing free###agency after the season . he said he got little interest in closer jonathan###papelbon , who has a high###salary and diminishing velocity , and did not get an enticing offer for the star left hander cliff###lee . someone would have had to bowl us over to do something on cliff , amaro said . he 's a top of the rotation guy who would be very difficult to replace . however much money he 's making , it 's not a money issue for us . he 's a guy that can produce , and not too many left handers or pitchers in the game can produce as well as he can . having that guy at the top of the rotation every year ? as i 've said , for us to contend , you have to have those guys at the top of the rotation . the red###sox got something close to that in peavy , a three time all star and a former cy###young###award###winner . at least in part , they have the biogenesis saga to thank for it .
london###scottish football###clubs will be reunited in a new professional###league next season after smaller teams backed a plan designed to spread limited revenues more evenly . the agreement reverses a breakaway by top clubs to form the scottish###premier###league ( spl ) 15 years###ago and will allow more money to filter down to the second tier . scottish###football###league clubs approved the changes on wednesday , marking the end of the road for a###league body set up in . the shake up has already won the blessing of spl teams . the main change that fans will notice is the introduction of end of season###play###offs to decide one of the places in the top division . the current structure of a 12 team top flight and three lower divisions of top 10 teams each will remain . many clubs are facing a struggle to survive financially in scotland after 54 times champions rangers collapsed under a pile of debt last year . rangers have just been promoted to the third tier after they were forced to relaunch from the bottom level of the national game . glasgow rivals rangers and celtic have long dominated scottish football . away from those two clubs , attendances are modest and the value of television rights is relatively low .
hexham , england dan greenwood of england holed a 5 foot par###putt on the 18th hole sunday as great###britain ireland rallied in singles to end the pga###cup in a tie . the trophy still goes home with the americans because they were the defending###champion . gb i trailed by five points going into the final day at slaley hall . it won seven of the 10 singles matches and halved one to make up the deficit and forge only the fourth draw in 26 matches between club professionals . the americans still have a 17 5 4 record in the pga###cup , and they have not lost it since .
paris wild###card gael monfils confirmed there is never a dull###moment when he takes part in the french###open by upsetting czech fifth seed tomas berdych in a first round marathon at roland garros on monday . the frenchman , whose career has been recently plagued by a knee###injury , prevailed 7 6 6 4 6 7 6 7 7 5 in front of an ecstatic court philippe chatrier after four hours three minutes . the result marked a spectacular reverse in fortune for berdych , who reached the madrid masters last four by beating world number one novak###djokovic in the quarter###finals . former world number seven monfils , who started his freefall in the atp rankings when he pulled out of last year 's french###open , is no stranger to upsets and prolonged ties at his home slam . in , the parisian played into the night , until almost 10 o'clock against italian fabio###fognini in a second round###match which he lost the following day after more than four hours of tennis . two years###ago , monfils toyed with david###ferrer 's nerves and beat him 8 6 in the fifth set to reach the last eight . in , it was andy###roddick who lost his temper , complaining to the umpire that it was too dark to play and , after both were forced to continue###playing , monfils sealed a fourth###round win in straight###sets as dusk settled . on monday monfils did not wait for the dark . it 's magical here , it 's a place where i feel good , where i manage to transcend myself , monfils , who saw off four break###points in the decider , told a news conference . asked how he pulled it off , the frenchman said my only answer is i worked . i worked . and i believed in myself . i have gone through very difficult moments , so necessarily , you know , you get tougher . berdych barely offered an explanation for his performance . if you 're asking for ( what made ) the difference , then i think that , well , i had one chance in the fifth set , he said . i did n't make it . he made one , so he made it . that 's absolutely what was the difference between us today . the result capped a good day for frenchmen as richard###gasquet , jo###wilfried###tsonga and julien benneteau also advanced into the second round . seventh###seed gasquet produced a classy performance to dismiss ukraine 's sergiy###stakhovsky , while tsonga , the sixth###seed , made light work of slovenian aljaz bedene . benneteau , the 30th seed , survived a minor scare to see off lithuanian ricardas berankis .
los###angeles who knew that the star of mozart 's the magic###flute could be a gangly black cat ? in the los###angeles###opera 's irresistible new production , which opened on saturday at the dorothy###chandler###pavilion here , the mischievous bird catcher papageno has traded feathers for a feline that leaps from tree to tree , fends off angry dogs and gets captured in a bell###jar , radiating charisma all the while . oh , i forgot to mention that , like everything in this magic###flute besides the singers , the charming cat is merely a cartoon projected on a flat###screen . the human performers , their faces painted silent###film white , do n't###run the show here they are fitted into a fanciful vision of animation from the 1920s . the three boys who guide papageno and the prince tamino on their journey seem to pop out of a basket held###aloft by enormous moths . the head of the soprano erika miklosa , singing the queen of the night 's stratospheric high notes , looks as if it 's been planted atop an enormous spider with writhing , piercing claws . so clever is the concept , by suzanne andrade and paul barritt , the principals of the british theater group , and their co director barrie###kosky , and so precise the execution that all of this imagery is persuasive . both the humor and seriousness of the magic###flute are done full justice by the production 's gleefully yet gently macabre aesthetic . ( if you know the classic disney short the skeleton dance , you get the idea . ) monostatos , the moorish servant who wants the captive princess pamina for himself , is made up as f . w . murnau 's nosferatu . tamino 's magic###flute has been reimagined as a fairy trailing musical notes , reminiscent of some hyperactive sequences from baz###luhrmann 's moulin###rouge . as christopher koelsch , the company 's president and chief###executive , said in an interview , the production is an ideal marriage of weimar and hollywood of berlin , where the production originated this year at the adventurous komische###oper , and los###angeles . this time last year , there were no plans to bring it here . the los###angeles###opera had scheduled a fifth revival of its well liked 1993 peter###hall production of the magic###flute . but mr . koelsch was tipped off to the berlin version and traveled there to see it in january , where he became convinced it was right for his company . it felt like it would be a terrible missed###opportunity if we did n't pursue it , he said . he got james###conlon , the music director here and the flute conductor , and pl###cido###domingo , the general###manager , on board . the enterprising minnesota###opera was already interested in the show , so the two companies joined###forces and budgets to bring it to america it opens in minnesota in april . while it 's not unheard of for a theater to change productions with little time to spare , it 's usually an unhappy necessity rather than a deliberate###choice . but the los###angeles###opera 's late switch this new flute was not officially###announced until june should be a positive example for the opera world , where artistic choices can be encased in amber up to five years in advance . companies should be eagerly looking for new singers and stagings that can be presented in a matter of months rather than years . ( o . k. , i 'd accept maybe a year or two . ) this new flute shows that the results can be worth the rush and risk . few things tend to get stale more quickly than animated projections , but this production stays miraculously fresh , sustaining surprise and delight in its two and a half###hours . there is a steady###influx of new images , from the solemn parade of mechanical###animals in front of sarastro 's temple to the flowers that grow when pamina waters the ground with papageno 's tears during their duet , bei m nnern welche liebe f hlen . fetching men and women , representing the mates for whom the singers long , emerge from the blooms . but i agreed with my guest at the performance when she said , joking only a little , that papageno 's cat was the only character with which she felt an emotional###connection . the production 's most radical intervention is to remove the opera 's dialogue and replace it with cleverly rendered intertitles underscored , as if at a silent###film , by excerpts from two of mozart 's keyboard fantasias . the idea is legitimate and in keeping with the overall concept , but it has a chilly effect . the opera takes on the feel of a hit###parade , a concert with dazzling visuals but a lack of heart it was easy to be impressed but harder to care . as always in the magic###flute , the hapless , endearing papageno has it easiest in terms of audience sympathy particularly with an adorable tabby in tow , the steady voiced baritone rodion pogossov , forlorn in a mustard color suit , savvily earned attention . the rising soprano janai brugger , tone creamy and phrasing elegant , found feeling within the constraints of the production 's stylization , her hair in an expressionist era louise###brooks bob and her body flinching eloquently under the burden of pamina 's suffering . attempting his first tamino , the tenor lawrence###brownlee had more trouble than she did asserting personality , with singing that was classy but staid . ( the company deserves great###credit for casting a black romantic leading couple , still extremely###unusual in opera . ) mr . conlon led a performance , and particularly a radiant chorus , whose liveliness matched the show 's energy , propulsive even when meditative . shortcomings and all , this production points the way toward a freer , more experimental style of producing opera , even in a mainstream context . it 's true there are limitations on what might be possible in an age of caution . as mr . koelsch said , i do n't think you want the reputation of your company being , so freewheeling that you ca n't make a decision . but there is lots of middle###ground between being indecisive and being stodgy . if companies can make this kind of agility an integral part of their missions , and get their donors on board for the ride , there is no reason occasions like this ingenious magic###flute need be rarities .
madrid sheldon g . adelson , the billionaire casino magnate , on friday abandoned his plans to build a 30 billion gambling and leisure resort on the outskirts of madrid after failing to win financial concessions and other favors from the spanish###government . the decision by mr . adelson 's company , las###vegas###sands , to drop its eurovegas resort project is an economic blow not just for madrid but for spain as a whole . the country has been pining for foreign###investment to help revive its economy and cut its 26 percent unemployment###rate . although spain recently###emerged from a two year recession , it remains mired in stagnation , deeply###troubled by low consumer###spending and a domestic credit squeeze that lingers from the country 's housing bust and the subsequent banking bailout in . but while mr . adelson was openly welcomed by the government , several spanish civic and religious###groups , opposed to gambling , sought to block the eurovegas project . some critics warned the authorities against bending spanish legislation to suit mr . adelson , by granting him special tax benefits as well as accepting his request to exempt eurovegas from a nationwide###ban on smoking in public###spaces . political###opponents of the governing popular###party also argued against granting sands any tax###concessions . with an estimated###net###worth of . 5 billion , the 80 year old mr . adelson is one of the richest###men in the world . the bulk of his wealth comes from the extravagant casino resorts he has developed in las###vegas , the venetian and the palazzo several built or redeveloped more recently in macao , a former portuguese colony that is now part of china and one in singapore . mr . adelson , long a supporter of conservative causes , has been an active###player in american politics . in the 2012 presidential###election , he donated more than 60 million to his preferred###candidates , first newt###gingrich and then mitt###romney , a sum that made him the single largest financial contributor in a presidential###race . in a statement on friday , sands said that it had dropped the madrid project after an extensive review and that it would instead pursue alternative###investment opportunities in asia . it did not detail the review 's conclusions . developing integrated resorts in europe has been a vision of mine for years , mr . adelson said in the statement , but there is a time and place for everything , and right now our focus is on encouraging asian###countries , like japan and korea , to dramatically enhance their tourism offering through the development of integrated resorts there . mr . adelson 's investments , dependent as they are on securing regulatory###approval from states and foreign###governments , have frequently courted###controversy . earlier this year , mr . adelson 's company , las###vegas###sands , disclosed in a regulatory filing that it might have breached a federal law prohibiting bribery of foreign###officials . for some time now , mr . adelson 's business activities and investment plans in china have been closely scrutinized , including payments sands made via a separate chinese company . in , his company was sued by a former employee who claimed he had been forced to impose improper pressure on chinese government officials . macau , the gambling mecca in china , has become the main driver of mr . adelson 's wealth . analysts say that overall gambling revenue in macau was 38 billion last year close to 90 percent of its economy compared to about 6 billion in las###vegas . in europe , casino gambling has been relatively limited the monte###carlo casinos in monaco , the largest on the continent , generate about 230 million in gambling revenue . mr . adelson , who announced his plans to bring a megaresort to the continent in , would have overwhelmed that . while there were rumors from time to time that mr . adelson might be tempted if the greek government were prepared to essentially let him take over an island in the aegean , it appears that from the start he seriously considered only spain for the immense project . in september , after a lengthy competition between spain 's two largest###cities , sands chose madrid for eurovegas rather than barcelona . at the time , mr . adelson 's choice was seen not only as a fillip for madrid 's regional economy but also as a sign that foreign###investors were ready to return to spain . underlining the importance of such a project for the country , prime###minister mariano###rajoy met three times with mr . adelson to discuss his eurovegas plans . the project had already run into delays , as sands originally###planned to start construction of eurovegas in mid 2013 and complete the complex within 10 years . mr . adelson 's u###turn came after mr . rajoy 's government reviewed his request for the smoking exemption , as well as his financial###demands . according to spanish officials , those included an insistence that the government guarantee financial###compensation for any changes in the country 's gambling laws that could hurt eurovegas and grant eurovegas a special rate on the gambling tax . spain 's review also included discussions with the european###commission to determine whether making such concessions would violate european antitrust rules . sands proposed eurovegas as a giant resort that would operate 12 hotels with a total of , 000 rooms , six casinos with , 000 slot###machines , and three golf###courses . but sands remained evasive about how it would finance the project , saying last year that its own contribution would be 25 to 35 percent of the equity of eurovegas and that it would look for financing###options from the capital###markets to cover the rest of the cost . politicians in opposition###parties warned mr . rajoy and madrid 's regional###government , which is also in the hands of the conservative popular###party , against providing any special fiscal or regulatory treatment for eurovegas . tom s g mez , the socialist###party 's regional###leader in madrid , said last year that even though eurovegas would help his city , the socialists would work to ensure that the law was the same for everybody . spain under the rule of mr . rajoy has taken aggressive steps in hard hit southern###europe to ease the path for foreign###investors , especially in the automotive###industry , where exports have played an important part in the country 's tepid economic###recovery .
washington jacob j . lew began his first trip to europe as treasury###secretary on sunday , a four city tour in which he is expected to try to persuade finance ministers to pursue a little more growth and a little less austerity to improve the economic###fortunes of the continent and the world . growth is again at the top of the obama administration 's agenda as mr . lew meets over a 48 hour period with high ranking leaders representing the european###union , germany and france . europe 's sovereign###debt###crisis continues to simmer for its fourth year , most recently in portugal over the weekend , and european unemployment rates are still rising . the euro###zone economy shrank in the fourth###quarter of , with the large economies of germany , france , spain and italy all contracting . our european partners need to safeguard the stability they have achieved so far , a senior treasury official said , noting that euro###zone problems reduced global growth by three tenths of a percentage###point last year . in light of the reality that countries representing one third of euro###area g.d.p . are shrinking their budgets and restructuring their economies , it is vital to see rebalancing within the euro###area with surplus economies contributing more to demand , said the official , who insisted on anonymity in discussing the treasury###secretary 's plans . some european officials have also said they are concerned about a potential cycle of austerity and recession , with budget###cuts leading to shrinking economies , making it harder and harder to meet budget goals . the economic###outlook for the euro###area remains subject to downside risks , mario draghi , the president of the european###central###bank , said at a news conference last week . mr . lew is scheduled to meet with mr . draghi on monday . the risks include the possibility of even weaker than expected domestic###demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural###reforms in the euro###area , mr . draghi said . these factors have the potential to dampen the improvement in confidence and thereby delay the recovery . but countries like germany have shown little willingness to ease the constraints of austerity for peripheral european###countries , or to engage in stimulus spending themselves . and for years , european officials have bridled at being lectured by officials from washington particularly because many feel that their financial###crisis was largely caused by american financial###products exported around the world by american banks . though mr . lew will travel to europe with a familiar message from washington , it may not be delivered as urgently as in the past . the european crisis continues to weigh on american growth , cutting into exports , but many economists believe that the united###states has entered a cycle of self sustaining economic###growth driven by a turnaround in housing and improving household budgets . moreover , american companies have over the last few years steeled themselves against europe 's financial###woes , and the risk of contagion is perceived to be relatively low . europe was the primary international concern for timothy f . geithner , mr . lew 's predecessor as treasury###secretary and a familiar###face on the continent . but perhaps as a sign of europe 's diminishing threat to united###states economic###stability , mr . lew 's first overseas trip as treasury###secretary , last month , was not to paris or berlin or brussels , but to beijing . european leaders are expected to press mr . lew on an eagerly###anticipated free###trade###agreement . a study by the european###commission found that a deal could increase european###union exports to the united###states by as much as 28 percent , a lift for the flailing european economy . the european###commission is ready with a proposed mandate for the future###negotiations , karel de gucht , the european trade commissioner , said in a statement last month . we can now roll up our sleeves and get down to the business of preparing negotiations . the treasury official said we will seek an ambitious , comprehensive and high standard agreement . the official added that such an agreement would include full elimination of tariffs , reductions in nontariff barriers and disciplines that address emerging challenges such as state###owned###enterprises and localization barriers . financial###regulations , including a proposed european tax on financial###transactions , are expected to be a major subject of negotiations as well . but concerns over growth , austerity and stability in the euro###zone looked certain to be the central###topic of negotiations yet again . speaking at a conference in china on sunday , christine###lagarde , the managing###director of the international###monetary###fund , also reiterated her concerns about growth . low and lopsided growth is not enough , ms . lagarde said at the boao###forum###for###asia annual###conference , citing the continuing troubles in europe . it is not enough of a real recovery . it is not enough of a global recovery . in brussels on monday , mr . lew will meet with herman###van###rompuy , president of the european###council jos###manuel###barroso , president of the european###commission olli###rehn , commissioner for economic###and###monetary###affairs and michel###barnier , commissioner for internal###market and services . he will also meet with mr . draghi in frankfurt . on tuesday , he will travel to berlin and paris to meet with his counterparts , the finance ministers wolfgang###sch###uble of germany and pierre###moscovici of france .

london ukraine dented montenegro 's hopes of qualifying for the world###cup###finals for the first time with a stunning 4 0 win that blasted group h wide###open on friday when the fancied teams were made to fight hard for their points . scotland , who have no chance of reaching next year 's finals in brazil , epitomised the battling spirit shown by some of the underdogs with a shock 1 0 victory in croatia where a robert###snodgrass goal hit the hosts' chances of topping group a . section leaders belgium earned a nervy 2 1 home###win over serbia with headers from kevin de bruyne and marouane###fellaini securing their sixth win in seven to put them three points clear of the croats . belgium cannot now finish lower than second . russia , who led group f after four straight###wins , suffered their first defeat as an early helder postiga goal gave portugal a 1 0 win over fabio###capello 's side to take top spot with 14 points , two clear of russia and three above israel . among those trying to upset the odds were albania and iceland , neither of whom have ever reached the finals , with both having a chance to top group e . at one stage , the pair seemed headed for home###wins over norway and slovenia respectively . ultimately , though , they both failed in their quest . albania conceded a late###goal and were held to a 1 1 draw by norway in tirana while iceland led slovenia 2 1 in reykjavik but ended up losing 4 2 leaving switzerland , who face cyprus on saturday , top by a point in group e above the albanians . group b laggards malta had a night to remember with their first world###cup qualifying victory for 20 years while perennial whipping boys liechtenstein and luxembourg also avoided defeat . liechtenstein dented slovakia 's playoff chances with a 1 1 draw in group g and luxembourg finished their group f match with the same scoreline in azerbaijan . malta went one better to beat armenia 1 0 in yerevan with a goal from their record scorer michael###mifsud and there was more romance in dublin where ireland kept their qualifying hopes###alive with a 3 0 group c win over the faroe###islands . irish captain robbie###keane not only celebrated a record 126th cap for his country , but also scored a hat###trick to extend his all time scoring###record for ireland to 59 goals . with austria beating sweden 2 1 in the same group , germany , who did not play , remain top with 16 points from six games , followed by austria and ireland on 11 with the swedes slipping to fourth on eight , albeit with a game in hand . keane told###espn there was a lot of talk about getting the record number of caps , but for me that was in the back of my mind . the most important###thing was getting the right result . the results were also as expected for some of the teams closing in on a ticket to brazil , but not for montenegro who lost their unbeaten###record and two players as they suffered a four goal thrashing by ukraine in podgorica . montenegro had vladimir###volkov and savo pavicevic sent off after ukraine 's roman zozulia was red###carded at the end of the first half as the visitors climbed to third in the group with a victory which also did england a favour . montenegro stay top with 14 points from seven games , having played a match more than second placed england on . ukraine moved up to 11 points from six matches , ahead of poland on nine after the poles could only draw with lowly moldova . the biggest###winners of the night were bosnia who triumphed 5 0 in latvia in group g to stay three points clear of greece who won 1 0 in lithuania thanks to lazaros###christodoulopoulos who scored midway through the first half . italy , who look set to qualify from group b , were held to a 0 0 draw by an enterprising czech###republic side in prague where their controversial striker mario balotelli was sent off by norwegian referee svein oddvar moen 18 minutes from time . balotelli picked up his second yellow###card for catching defender theodor gebre selassie in the face with his forearm and will now miss italy 's next match against bulgaria in september . this season 's qualifiers will be wrapped up on tuesday when denmark play armenia in group b , sweden meet the faroes in group c and belarus host finland in group i after losing 1 0 in the reverse###fixture on friday .
while many who live in and work in cooperstown were braced for a blow to the town 's annual hall of fame weekend , it took wednesday 's depressing election announcement to land the actual punch . the traditional induction party will go on as it always does in late###july , but because it wo n't involve a single living honoree , it 's unclear just who exactly will be inclined to show up . the hall of fame and the baseball writers' association of america tried to put a brave , reasonable face on the group 's decision not to elect a new member , calling it part of an honest selection###process for the sport as it continues to come to terms with the fallout from the steroid era . and it 's not as if this has n't###happened before , and long before performance###enhancing###drugs were part of the discussion . there were , in fact , eight previous###elections in which no one reached the 75 percent###threshold for selection , most recently in . still , that does n't mean wednesday 's news went over well on cooperstown 's main###street . i think it 's absolutely terrible , said jeff foster , owner of the legends are forever memorabilia store . i think the hall of fame voters were trying to make some kind of point . but mike###piazza and craig###biggio , they belong in the hall of fame . it 's shameful . in many of the empty years , the veteran 's selections filled the void the 1996 weekend , for instance , was spiced with the inductions of the colorful manager earl###weaver and the formidable pitcher jim###bunning but this year , those selections are bringing no such relief . the three who were chosen were the umpire hank o'day , the owner jacob###ruppert and a catcher , deacon###white , all of whom have been dead for many decades . as a result , this will be the first induction###ceremony since 1960 in which no living honoree will be on stage to accept a plaque . in an obvious attempt to generate more interest in what is now a relatively barren induction weekend , jeff idelson , the hall of fame 's president , announced that there would be a ceremony to honor those who never got a proper induction because of the impact of world###war###ii . that group includes rogers###hornsby and lou###gehrig as well as the 10 member class of . nobody in cooperstown was rooting for a shutout , idelson said of the vote announcement . we hope to have a large###number of hall of famers return for a reunion and a lot of people come for the weekend to see them . and honoring the people who never had an induction###ceremony we think that will help draw people . not everyone is convinced . unless they come up with something truly unique , i do n't see that drawing many people , said vincent russo , owner of mickey 's place , a memorabilia store on main###street . it 's going to be pretty quiet here . quiet in cooperstown in july is usually not a good thing . local###business###owners say the event took a big###hit in , when the hall of fame exhibition###game that used to be held in conjunction with induction weekend was moved to earlier in the summer . nevertheless , foster said induction weekend still accounts for somewhere between 10 and 15 percent of a lot of businesses' annual###revenue , which made wednesday 's news all the more downbeat . i think this is going to end up like a regular summer###weekend , no more busy than normal , he said . the voters' rejection of both barry###bonds and roger###clemens , superstars done in by their direct###links to performance enhancers , was not entirely unexpected . hurting almost as much was the failure of another first time candidate , piazza , to win induction , although he did a good deal better in the balloting than bonds or clemens did . as a mets hero , piazza would have drawn hordes of people from the new york area for the induction###ceremony had he been elected . but he fell nearly 100 votes short . in the end , the hall hopes 2013 becomes just another historical footnote , no more memorable than , when yogi###berra fell 28 votes shy of breaking that year 's shutout in his first year of eligibility . sometimes the ballot just flushes out like that , said jack###o'connell , the secretary treasurer of the writers' association . we all know this time what the 800 pound gorilla in the room is , but sometimes the ballot is just weak or voters are n't###ready to induct those particular players . in some ways , that 's what people are thinking this year . they are n't###ready yet to vote for these players . but in the interim , there will be at least one very modest induction weekend , and it will happen just six months from now .
washington the minister selected by president###obama to deliver the benediction at his inaugural withdrew thursday from the program , putting a quick end to a developing controversy over a sermon he gave in the 1990s in which he called on christians to fight the aggressive agenda of the gay###rights###movement . the minister , the rev . louie###giglio , said in a statement that he would continue to pray regularly for the president including on inauguration day but did not want to become a distraction . due to a message of mine that has surfaced from 15 20 years###ago , the statement said , it is likely that my participation and the prayer i would offer will be dwarfed by those seeking to make their agenda the focal###point of the inauguration . officials at mr . obama 's presidential###inaugural committee , which operates separately from the white###house , announced the decision less than 24 hours after news of mr . giglio 's sermon surfaced and took responsibility for failing to properly vet him . we were not aware of pastor giglio 's past comments at the time of his selection , and they do n't reflect our desire to celebrate the strength and diversity of our country at this inaugural , said addie whisenant , the spokeswoman for the committee . pastor giglio was asked to deliver the benediction in large part for his leadership in combating human###trafficking around the world . as we now work to select someone to deliver the benediction , we will ensure their beliefs reflect this administration 's vision of inclusion and acceptance for all americans . mr . giglio is founder of the passion conferences , an atlanta organization that brings college students together in prayer and worship . the sermon , titled in search of a standard christian response to homosexuality , can be heard on a christian training web###site . in it , he said homosexuality is sin in the eyes of god , and it is sin in the word of god . he also advocated the healing power of jesus as the only way out of a homosexual lifestyle a comment some gay###rights advocates interpreted as an endorsement of reparative###therapy , or so called gay to straight conversion , as a supposed cure for homosexuality . the minister 's quick withdrawal highlights how sensitive the white###house is to concerns over gay###rights . it comes at a time when mr . obama 's candidate for defense secretary , chuck###hagel , a former nebraska senator , is under fire for comments he made about gay people in the 1990s some activists said the administration could ill afford two controversies over gay###rights at the same time . it was the right decision , said chad griffin , the president of the human###rights campaign , a washington based advocacy###group . participants in the inaugural festivities should unite rather than divide . choosing an affirming and fair###minded voice as his replacement would be in keeping with the tone the president wants to set for his inaugural . the giglio controversy echoes a controversy over mr . obama 's 2009 inaugural , when he angered many gay###rights advocates by selecting the rev . rick###warren , author of the purpose driven life and an outspoken opponent of same###sex###marriage , to deliver the benediction . i think this is actually a bigger deal than rick###warren because this gentleman is in many ways much worse , said richard socarides , who advised president###bill###clinton on issues concerning gay people . rick###warren was not a good choice but he is kind of in the mainstream of religious thinking , but this guy is really an outlier . mr . obama , who opposed###same###sex###marriage until last year , is featuring gay and lesbian people in several ways at his inaugural . he has selected richard###blanco , a poet of cuban###descent who is openly###gay , to be the 2013 inaugural poet . and for the second time , he has invited the gay and lesbian band association to march in the parade , becoming the first president to do so .
after jimmy haslam bought the cleveland###browns in the summer , he stood in the middle of a field at his very first practice , wearing a browns t###shirt and shorts , a promising sign that the franchise one of the n.f.l . 's most storied , but long lagging while in the hands off control of the former owner randy###lerner would finally have the attention and enthusiasm of the person in charge . on monday , however , it became clear that haslam , who paid more than 1 billion for the browns and only a few days###ago sold the minority###stake he had held in the pittsburgh###steelers , has much bigger concerns than which players the browns will select in next week 's draft . agents from the federal###bureau###of###investigation and the internal###revenue###service raided and locked down the headquarters of pilot flying j , the family business of truck stops and convenience###stores run by haslam , on monday###afternoon in knoxville , tenn . , as part of a continuing investigation . it will take some time for us to finish what we 're doing , marshall stone , the spokesman for the f.b.i . office in knoxville , said , declining to provide further details . the scene monday , according to what a pilot flying j employee told the knoxville###news###sentinel , involved a few dozen federal and local###law###enforcement officials , some wearing bulletproof###vests , swiftly moving through the three office buildings on the corporate###campus . they were verifying employees' identifies and job###titles , instructing them to turn off their computers and cellphones , and telling some to stay while sending others home . haslam , 59 , told###reporters tuesday that the investigation was related to rebates that customers complained had not been properly paid . it does not involve any tax issues , he said . documents were seized by the authorities during the search haslam said he did not know specifically which ones . he added that although he had not been subpoenaed , some members of the company 's sales###staff had been . he also said that he planned to be in cleveland on thursday and friday to prepare for the draft and apologized because the last thing we ever want to do is put any blemish on cleveland or the browns . in a statement given to reporters tuesday in the form of a q . and a. , the company acknowledged that multiple search###warrants were served monday . the statement also said the investigation appeared to center on the application of rebates to what the company said was a small number of trucking###company customers . the company statement said that , to their knowledge , no company###executives were targets . and it seemed to raise the question of whether the raid could be politically###motivated haslam 's brother bill , the former president of the company , is the governor of tennessee . that 's not for us to say , the statement said , in reply to its own question . pilot flying j owns more than 600 travel###centers throughout the country and employs more than , 000 people . forbes###magazine called it one of the country 's largest###privately###held companies , with 29 billion in sales annually . the haslam family , according to forbes , owns 59 percent of pilot , with jimmy haslam owning 35 percent of that share . the magazine lists jimmy haslam 's net worth at . 8 billion . haslam , whose father , jim , played###football at tennessee , bought a minority###stake in the steelers in . in the summer , he became aware that lerner was looking to sell the team , and little more than a month later , haslam bought it . the n.f.l . looks closely , and with independent advisers , into the finances of potential owners . if the source of the owner 's wealth is a family business , the league looks at the company finances and its reputation . there is also an extensive background###check into the individual , similar to those conducted when hiring a top executive . this is not the first time that the haslams' company has had legal###trouble . in , the united###states###department###of###labor announced an agreement in which the company would pay 110 assistant###managers , 000 in back wages and damages to resolve violations of the overtime provisions of the fair###labor###standards###act , according to the news sentinel . and the company settled price###gouging allegations in three states by paying fines in the wake of hurricane###ike in . haslam , with a commanding speaking###style , made a strong first impression in cleveland , promising that there was no chance he would move the team and proclaiming that he would be involved and transparent . that was a marked departure from the reclusive lerner , who inherited the team after the death of his father , al , who purchased the franchise from the n.f.l . in . haslam

facing an abundance of roster questions , the yankees are willing to talk to virtually every free###agent in the coming###weeks , general###manager brian###cashman said . the team intends to call the agents for carlos beltran , brian###mccann , shin###soo###choo and others to see what their clients are looking for and whether there might be a fit . we are going to reach out to everyone , said cashman , who was preparing for next week 's meetings of general###managers . we have a lot of holes to fill . that includes starting###pitching , and the yankees are pursuing the japanese ace masahiro###tanaka . they are also seeking bullpen help . some closers could be in the mix , even though the yankees have david###robertson ready to replace mariano###rivera . because rivera retired and boone###logan is a free###agent , the yankees need quality relief###pitchers . if they can sign joe###nathan or grant###balfour at a reasonable###price , they may do so . brian###wilson could be an option , but only if he is willing to comply with the team 's no beards policy . also , because the yankees have robertson , a closer is not as much of a priority for them as it is for some other teams , like the detroit###tigers . more desperate clubs could outbid the yankees for the best arms available . if curtis###granderson accepts the yankees' one year , 14 . 1 million qualifying###offer , their outfield would be settled . if granderson signs elsewhere , beltran becomes a more likely candidate than choo . the 31 year old choo would require a longer deal with more overall money , and the yankees are trying to keep their payroll below the 189 million luxury tax threshold for . beltran is 36 and less likely to seek a lengthy deal . the yankees could also use a catcher . mccann 's left handed swing would be productive in yankee###stadium . a . j . pierzynski and jarrod###saltalamacchia are also possibilities , and the yankees have internal options like francisco###cervelli , austin romine and j . r . murphy , who impressed the team when he was called up in september . the yankees continue to think about possible replacements for second baseman robinson cano in case they are unable to sign him to a long###term deal , but none of the options are nearly as enticing as cano . tanaka has not yet declared that he will enter major###league###baseball , but teams are preparing for his arrival . the yankees are expected to make a competitive bid the posting fee for tanaka , which could exceed 60 million , would not count against the 189 million luxury tax threshold .
despite dysfunction in washington and a 16 day government###shutdown , the economy chugged along in october , surprising many analysts as private###sector hiring bounced back after a spring slowdown . the latest###figures , along with upward revisions for job###creation in august and september released by the labor department on friday , lifted the estimated monthly pace of hiring to , 000 over the last three months . if that strength persists , the federal###reserve will probably feel###comfortable enough to begin easing back on its stimulus efforts , economists said , though probably not as early as its next meeting in december . over all , experts said the new data showed an economy with more underlying strength than first thought , but not necessarily growing as fast as many policy###makers would like . sometimes it 's a little faster , sometimes it 's a little slower , said guy berger , united###states economist at rbs . the labor market is in decent shape , but it 's not doing that much better than six months or a year ago . still , the addition of , 000 nonfarm jobs in october eased fears about the impact of the shutdown and prompted some usually cautious observers to wonder whether the economy was finally###finding its footing after four years of on again , off again growth . maybe this is the beginning of that long###awaited period of better growth for the economy , said ethan harris , co head of global economics at bank###of###america###merrill###lynch . october was remarkably resilient . although strong economic reports by raising expectations of a quicker move by the fed to rein in its extra stimulus have sometimes spooked markets in the past , stocks surged on friday as traders bet healthier growth and rising earnings would offset any damping effect caused by any fed retreat . some market veterans , however , recommended keeping the champagne on ice . it 's not a watershed yet , said diane swonk , chief economist at mesirow financial in chicago . a few more months like this could make it a watershed . we need at least another month of good data and some confidence in fiscal###policy for the fed to pull the trigger in december . a separate question from the timing of the fed tapering , which affects longer###term interest rates for loans like mortgages , is when the central###bank will begin raising short###term###interest###rates from their current rock bottom levels . the fed has signaled that will not happen before unemployment falls to . 5 percent , suggesting no move until at least . but now experts like jan hatzius of goldman###sachs say they think policy###makers will decrease that threshold to 6 percent or perhaps even lower . as a result , mr . hatzius said he expected the fed would hold off on raising short###term rates from near zero until early . the payroll data come from a monthly survey of employers , and the labor department said on friday that there were no discernible impacts of the partial federal government###shutdown on these figures , which came out a week behind schedule . if anything , analysts said , the delay in conducting the survey could have added to the numbers . but the unemployment###rate , based on a separate survey of households that counted furloughed federal###employees as out of work , rose to . 3 percent in october from . 2 percent in september . one mystery buried in friday 's report was a drop of , 000 in the size of the labor force , and the ensuing fall in the labor participation###rate to . 8 percent , a 35 year low . the labor participation###rate has been falling in recent###years as discouraged workers have dropped out of the work force , others have decided to stay in school or stay###home to take care of children , and the number of retirements by baby###boomers has picked up . but the drop in october was the biggest one month decline since the end of . a smaller labor force has the effect of making the overall unemployment###rate appear lower , but is a troubling sign for the long###term health of the economy . we 're scratching our heads , said mr . berger . you have to set this aside and look at the november report . does it reverse ? does it keep declining ? to us , it 's puzzling . the economy 's ability to seemingly shake off the effects of last month 's showdown in washington left both parties trying to spin the numbers in a way that favored their side .
on a sunday###morning early in january , about two dozen prominent physicists gathered behind closed###doors at the california###institute###of###technology to ponder the state of their craft . american physicists were not exactly sitting on the sidelines last july when cern announced the probable discovery of the long sought higgs###boson , the key to understanding the origin of mass and life in the universe . the united###states contributed 531 million to building and equipping the large###hadron###collider , the multibillion###dollar european machine with which the discovery was made . about , 200 americans work at cern , including joe incandela from the university of california , santa###barbara , who led one of the two teams making the july announcement . but as science goes forward , american particle physicists are wondering what role , if any , they will play in the future in high###energy###physics the search for the fundamental###particles and forces of nature a field they once dominated . there is enormous angst in the field , said michael s . turner , a physicist and cosmologist at the university of chicago , who attended the caltech meeting . after canceling the superconducting###super###collider , which would have been the world 's most powerful physics machine , in , and shutting down fermilab 's tevatron in , the united###states no longer has a machine of its own to explore the frontier where new particles and forces in the universe might be discovered . the only collider now operating in the united###states is the relativistic###heavy###ion###collider on long###island , which shoots gold ions at each other to study the interactions of quarks . it , too , is threatened to be shut down . fermilab 's biggest###project going forward is a plan to shoot a beam of neutrinos , ghostlike particles , 800 miles through the earth to a detector at the old homestake gold mine in lead , s.d. , to investigate their shape###shifting properties . the results could bear on one of the deep###seated and intractable problems in cosmology , namely why the universe is made of matter and not antimatter , but there is not enough money in the project 's budget to put the detector below ground , at the bottom of the mine , where it would be sheltered from cosmic###rays and able to observe neutrinos from distant supernova###explosions , instead of on the surface . americans who want to taste the thrills of the frontiers of high###energy###physics have to cast their eyes east to cern 's collider , which is set to dominate the field for the next 20 years . or they might look west , to japan , which is budgeting about 120 billion in stimulus money to help recover from the disaster at the fukushima nuclear###power###plant after the earthquake and tsunami in 2011 and wants to use some of it to host the next big###machine , the international###linear###collider , which would be 20 miles long and could manufacture higgs bosons for precision study . in february , in a ceremony at a physics conference in vancouver , british###columbia , the team that had been designing the collider for the last decade handed over the plans to a new consortium , the linear collider collaboration , directed by lyn evans , who built the large###hadron###collider at cern . dr . evans said the next big highlight of his career would be seeing construction start in the next couple of years in japan . how desperately does the united###states want to participate in these projects , from which the next great###advances in our understanding of the universe could come ? our issue is that europe and asia are contemplating or have made 10 billion investments in particle###physics , explained jim siegrist , associate###director for high###energy###physics at the department of energy , who says that kind of money is not going to be forthcoming in the united###states . how we compete is a problem for us . physicists are hoping to have some answers by this summer when they convene in minneapolis for snowmass , a planning conference named after the colorado resort where it used to be held until the place got too expensive . in the meantime there are only questions , like what is the country 's future relationship with cern ? the united###states is presently an observer at cern , but that arrangement expires in . joining as a full member would cost somewhere around 250 million a year and is out of the question . neither the agencies nor congress is interested , dr . siegrist said . nor , he thought , was cern itself interested in having the united###states government###accountability###office and others crawling down their shorts . for only about 25 million , however , the united###states could become an associate###member , an outcome favored by cern 's director general , rolf dieter heuer .
centennial , colo . the judge hearing the case against james e . holmes , the man accused of killing 12 people and wounding dozens more at an aurora , colo . , movie###theater in july , agreed on friday to postpone mr . holmes 's arraignment for two months at the defense 's request . the judge , william b . sylvester of arapahoe###county district court , had ruled late thursday that there was enough evidence presented during a three day preliminary###hearing for mr . holmes to stand###trial on 166 counts of murder , attempted###murder and other charges . but he agreed on friday to postpone the arraignment until march , to give mr . holmes 's lawyers more time to enter a plea . judge sylvester said that while he empathized with the victims' desire to move forward , he decided it was appropriate to give the defense more time to prepare for the arraignment hearing , given the trove of evidence that needed to be reviewed . prosecutors had objected to the delay , saying they were ready to proceed###immediately . victims of the attack and their family members , sitting in the courtroom gallery here , were visibly###upset at the prospect of having to wait for mr . holmes to enter a plea . as the lawyers and the judge discussed the matter , several in attendance stormed out of the courtroom . as the court was adjourning , steve hernandez , whose 32 year old daughter , rebecca wingo , was shot and killed in the theater , shouted , rot in hell , holmes ! the outburst prompted the judge to reconvene the court and gently admonish mr . hernandez . i 'm terribly sorry for your loss . and i can only begin to imagine the emotions that are raging , the judge said . mr . hernandez , who was ringed by a group of sheriff 's deputies and brought to the front of the courtroom , apologized . i meant no disrespect to the court , your honor , he said . the hearing has been under heavy security all week , with deputies using hand held metal###detectors to sweep each person entering the courtroom . and emotions have run high as prosecutors laid out their case against mr . holmes , a former neuroscience graduate###student at the university###of###colorado###denver . earlier in the week , an agent for the federal###bureau###of###investigation testified that mr . holmes told###investigators that he had planned to blow up his apartment to create a diversion the night of the shooting . prosecutors also presented haunting photos mr . holmes took of himself with a cellphone in the hours leading up to the shooting . one showed him grinning with the muzzle of a glock pistol nearby . in another , mr . holmes , wearing jet black contact###lenses and donning a cap , jutted his tongue out at the camera . mr . holmes 's lawyers did not call any witnesses during this week 's hearing and have indicated they plan to argue he is not guilty by reason of insanity . on friday , district###attorney george brauchler reminded the news###media that despite judge sylvester 's ruling that mr . holmes would stand###trial , mr . holmes was still innocent###until###proven###guilty . i want to protect the interests of all involved in this case , he said .
newark cory###schneider 's first three months in new jersey have been quite a roller###coaster ride . his nearly flawless preseason turned into a nightmarish first nine starts in a devils sweater . schneider was just 1 5 3 through those outings and has only a###4 5 4 record after 13 games . schneider has not played###poorly . his . 81 goals###against###average ranks third in the league for those who qualify for the vezina###trophy , and his . 925 save###percentage ranks 13th among the same group . but , like a pitcher with paltry run support , schneider has been adversely###affected by the devils' goal scoring struggles . this season they have been shut out five times and held to one goal on five other occasions . the last goalie to finish below . 500 with a sub . 00 goals###against###average was harry lumley , who went 23 24 22 with a . 94 goals###against###average with the toronto###maple###leafs in . jose theodore went 12 13 2 1 with a . 10 goals###against###average in 30 games in 1999 2000 ( won lost records at the time included four categories , the last being for overtime###losses . this was the last season in which a goalie finished in the top five in goals###against###average and had a sub . 500 record . dealt this off season from vancouver , schneider looked for a fresh###start , leaving the goaltending competition between him and roberto###luongo behind . schneider was to be the heir###apparent to martin###brodeur , and the torch passing appeared to take place in october , as schneider started 6 of the devils' first 10 games . still , brodeur is an institution in new jersey , and his play has improved###significantly since a rough stretch at the season 's outset . that , coupled with a minor###injury to schneider , put brodeur in goal for 11 of the devils' next 15 games . being the backup , and with the added frustration of the devils scoring only 12 goals in his first 10 starts , left schneider with a familiar feeling . he told###reporters last week , it 's like groundhog day for me . schneider , who is also hoping to impress the officials choosing the united###states###olympic###team , started three of the devils' next four games and won on back to back nights . schneider kept the devils in the nov . 29 game against the carolina###hurricanes before the devils exploded for four third period goals in a 5 2 victory . he followed that up the next night with a shutout of buffalo , a 1 0 overtime win , and all appeared healed between schneider and the devils . it 's all i 've wanted to do help this team win and be productive , schneider , 27 , said after saturday###night 's 1 0 overtime win against the buffalo###sabres . you have to play well , and you have to produce when you get the chance . schneider stopped 12 of 13 first period shots wednesday###night against the montreal###canadiens , making his best save late in the period when he gloved michael bournival 's shot after a turnover by eric gelinas . schneider 's play saved the devils , who struggled to find energy early . we looked a little lethargic , devils coach pete deboer said . he gave us a chance to get our legs under us . the devils rewarded schneider 's effort , as andrei loktionov and michael###ryder scored early third period goals , giving the devils a 2 1 lead . even after lars###eller 's goal , which beat schneider through a leaky spot between the pads , tied the game with only 3 minutes 50 seconds###left , patrik elias broke the tie with 06 to play . but schneider and the devils could not hold that edge , allowing david desharnais 's goal mere###seconds later , and montreal went on to win , 4 3 , in a shootout . it 's a tough###loss for us , schneider said . we battled hard in the third , and had two leads , and myself included , we 'd like to think we could make that stand up . wednesday was a rare off night for schneider . despite 27 saves , he allowed two nonthreatening shots to get behind him , nearly resulting in canadiens goals . schneider also failed to stop either of his chances in the shootout . i was n't good enough , schneider said of the shootout . i did n't make a save on either one , so it 's hard to win when you give up two for two to start . with games against the detroit###red###wings and the rangers coming up friday and saturday , and with the devils locked in a tightly###packed division , schneider appreciates what all the extra###points will mean . we 're scratching and clawing here , he said . we 're still in this thing . we 're real close .

for n.h.l . fans , the temptation to compare nathan###mackinnon and sidney###crosby is almost irresistible . mackinnon , the colorado###avalanche rookie , and crosby , the pittsburgh###penguins superstar , grew up in cole###harbour , a suburb of halifax , nova###scotia . both natural centers , they played###hockey at shattuck st . mary 's , a preparatory###school in minnesota were selected first over all in the quebec###major###junior###hockey###league draft and were taken first over all in the n.h.l . draft . they also both lived with the families of former stanley###cup playoff most valuable players during their rookie seasons mackinnon with goalie jean sebastien giguere , crosby with mario###lemieux . in fairness , the comparisons should end there . for example , crosby 's exclusion from the 2006 canadian olympic team at age 18 was hotly###debated , while mackinnon , at the same age , knows he will not play at the 2014 games in sochi , russia . i think everyone else is realizing i 'm not sid , mackinnon said . sid 's in a###league of his own right now as a player . he 's the best . i can try to pick up on his work ethic and his attention to detail . crosby and mackinnon have trained and skated together in the summer , and mackinnon is making an early bid to do one thing that eluded crosby win the calder###trophy as the n.h.l . 's rookie of the year . in , alex ovechkin topped crosby for the award . with 6 goals and 12 assists going into saturday 's game against the minnesota###wild , mackinnon is chasing tomas hertl of the san###jose###sharks for the league 's rookie points lead . swift , heady and positionally sound , mackinnon has sparkled on right wing alongside the team 's other young###stars , like center matt###duchene , 22 , and the captain gabriel###landeskog , 21 . when mackinnon opened the season with two assists against the anaheim###ducks on oct . 2 , he became the youngest n.h.l . player to record two or more points in his debut since . he scored three goals in four games between nov . 29 and dec . 6 . mackinnon , who had 153 points in 102 games with the halifax mooseheads the last two seasons , said he was learning how to produce at the n.h.l . level . be patient with the puck , settle down with it , make great plays , and things will eventually come to you , he said . mackinnon 's transition from junior###hockey has been aided by colorado 's renaissance under patrick###roy , the first year coach . the avalanche , who have not made the playoffs since , hit the 20 win mark after 27 games , a franchise###record , this season . so far , roy and mackinnon have formed a mutual###admiration society . mackinnon is averaging more than 16 minutes of ice time per game . i have a lot of confidence in nate , roy said . we 're very happy with him so far . we 're putting him in any situation . we 've tried him in the penalty killing and the power play . he 's been doing just great . the presence of roy , 48 , has helped to deflect the spotlight from mackinnon . supremely confident as an n.h.l . goalie , roy won a###league record 151 playoff###games and three conn###smythe trophies en###route to four stanley###cups with the montreal###canadiens and the avalanche . having the best goalie of all time coaching in the n.h.l . is pretty###cool , mackinnon said . every new city we play in , people want to know about him . he does a great job , and he 's very passionate about the game . i think he 's the biggest reason why this team has turned it around since last year . mackinnon said he was rarely recognized in public in denver , where he is still too young to drink legally . they have a lot of sports teams , and there 's a lot of stuff going on , he said . admitting to some homesickness , mackinnon plans to spend the olympic break in february with his family in nova###scotia . for now , though , he is enjoying a family atmosphere by living in the basement of giguere 's suburban###home . they have three little boys , and they 're all very cute , energetic kids , mackinnon said . i like to get upstairs as much as i can and play mini hockey with them or hang out and talk . it 's fun . giguere , 36 , added it 's been a good experience for myself , my wife and my kids . we enjoy having him around . it keeps me young .

dearborn###heights , mich . shortly before 1 a.m . on saturday , nov . 2 , a young###woman , just a year out of high###school , crashed the car she was driving along a residential###street on detroit 's west side . the woman , renisha marie mcbride , 19 , had veered into a parked###car . as people emerged from their houses , she appeared disoriented and troubled , some witnesses said , walking off into the darkness before returning for a time , then walking off again . someone heard her say she wanted to go home . several hours later and six blocks away , just outside the detroit city###limits in this mostly white suburb , ms . mcbride , who was black , was dead on the front porch of a stranger 's home , a shotgun blast to her face . in the days since , the death has stirred long###simmering racial###tensions between mostly black detroit and its whiter suburbs and provoked comparisons to other racially charged cases around the country . protesters held a vigil outside the house where she died , whose owner has not been publicly###identified . the authorities say he thought ms . mcbride , who tests have shown was intoxicated , was trying to break in . anguished family members and friends , wearing shirts with messages like justice for nisha , say they believe that ms . mcbride was merely seeking help at random homes after the crash , and they were troubled that the man who shot her had not been arrested . and civil###rights###activists in detroit have pointedly recalled the cases of trayvon###martin , the black teenager who was shot last year in a fatal encounter in florida , and jonathan ferrell , a black man who was shot to death by a police###officer in charlotte , n.c. , in september when he sought help after a car###accident . the wayne###county prosecutor was expected to announce on friday whether charges would be brought against the homeowner , but essential details were still lacking to explain how a car###accident had led , over a stretch of several hours in the middle of a night , to death on a tiny concrete porch . some people here cautioned against presuming that race played a role . some neighbors of the man , who they said is in his 50s and lives alone in his small house , said the shooting struck them as a tragic###accident . most of all , a long list of questions remained unanswered about events that night , including what actually took place in ms . mcbride 's final###moments . at the time i did n't think much of what i was seeing , said ledell hammond , 23 , who said he was among a group of neighbors who observed ms . mcbride , seeming dazed , then disappearing , after the car###crash along their block of bramell street . but to have this end with that ? it 's hard for me to find a way to make it add up . in a way , the anger here has become more muted since kym l . worthy , the wayne###county prosecutor , made it clear that her office was studying the case . ms . worthy , who is black , is widely###viewed as a tough , independent prosecutor . she is known , in part , for her prosecution of two white detroit police###officers in the beating death in 1992 of a black motorist , malice green , and for pursuing criminal###charges in 2008 against kwame###kilpatrick , then detroit 's mayor , who would eventually be convicted of federal crimes . even ms . mcbride 's family had praise for ms . worthy . there will be justice , bernita spinks , her aunt , said in an interview . ms . mcbride , who graduated from southfield high###school last year , had once told her sister that she wanted to become a police###officer , relatives said , but she had been working for a company that provides temporary###workers for light industrial facilities , officials at the company said . ms . spinks remembered her as an average student , a standout soccer###player and mostly a loner whose father had spoiled her with several cars since she got her license . she was a peaceful , kindhearted young###lady , ms . spinks said . family members have said they last spoke with her around 11 p.m . on nov . 1 , shortly before the car###accident .
irving , tex . one bye###week may not be enough time to cure what ails the dallas###cowboys , who appear as enigmatic as ever before their showdown with the giants on sunday . injuries and indignation surround the dallas defense , which has allowed an average of 440 yards a game and played so poorly in the 4 3 system of the new coordinator , monte###kiffin , that it has reached several franchise and n.f.l . lows . speculation continued to mount over the job###security of coach jason###garrett after the offense , under quarterback tony###romo , gained only 193 yards in the cowboys' last game , a 49 17 loss to the new orleans saints . all that remained was for the cowboys' owner , jerry###jones , to steer last week 's soap###opera toward a climactic finish . which , of course , he did , telling###reporters that garrett would be his coach in that he would not want anybody but kiffin coaching the defense and that romo would need to do more in the final six games of the season . we 're positioned to get in the playoffs , jones said . we see logically how to get in the playoffs . we have that , for all practical###purposes , in our control . now that 's a pretty good spot to be in after 10 games . the cowboys are , having beaten each of their three n.f.c . east rivals once this season , but any momentum has probably vanished as they regroup for a six game run and try to better their 8 8 records of the last two seasons . they sit a half game behind the eagles , who have won three games in a row . the giants ( 4 6 ) carry a four game winning###streak and growing###confidence into sunday 's game at metlife###stadium . you do n't just forget about everything that happened , cowboys tight###end jason###witten said . trust me , there 's been a lot of work and sweat and blood poured out there . i do n't think you wipe it , clean###slate . but there 's a mind set of a one game season for six times . that 's the approach you have to have . you get to sunday , your focus is simply on the ballgame and making plays . we 've got to find ways to make those plays against a good opponent , against a good defense . and we ca n't say after that game how we came up short again . the cowboys forced six turnovers and returned an interception and a fumble for touchdowns in their 36 31 victory over the giants to open the season , but they understand this is not the same opponent that was in an 0 6 free###fall a month ago . there 's a core###group of guys that have an unbelievable ability to focus and find ways to win those games and get themselves back in it , ' witten said . kiffin , too , cited the giants' experience as an element that made them dangerous . the thing about the new york giants they 've been through this before , he said , adding they do n't ever quit . i think they do that just on purpose , so they can come back and show what a great team they are . the giants were not nearly as complimentary toward the cowboys last week . defensive###end jason###pierre###paul said that there would be blood spilled and that the giants planned to hunt romo . safety will hill said that cowboys wideout dez###bryant does n't like to be touched and that the giants would be especially physical against him . whatever gets them motivated , said bryant , who had four receptions for 22 yards in the first meeting with the giants . all i know is sunday , i 'm going to play my game . they can say whatever they want to say . that 's what they believe ? let them believe that . i 'm not getting into any trash###talk . yet it is hard to talk trash with a defense that is on a stunning collision course with the wrong side of history . the unit has set###franchise###records for total###yards allowed twice in its last three games , giving up 625 to new orleans and 623 to the detroit###lions on oct . 27 . yet dallas still has a chance as it begins its final stretch , which culminates with a game against the eagles on dec . 29 . you all take that like you want to take it , whatever that is , linebacker ernie###sims said , referring to the giants' comments . if you 're any kind of competitor , this is where it 's at . you see the eagles making a run , you look and see the giants making a run , and that should be enough . you have to be motivated just to see that .
dublin , ohio jack###nicklaus only has to look at some of the clashes on the pga###tour in recent###months to see how far golf has come since he was in his prime . we were trying to figure out how to get somebody to write about anything when we played , nicklaus said wednesday on the eve of the memorial . i think today you have to figure out how you keep somebody from writing about anything . it 's a big###difference . vijay###singh is suing the pga###tour over its anti###doping policy . a small###group of players has retained a lawyer over the new rule involving long putters . and the dispute getting all the attention is tiger###woods and sergio garcia , who did n't###hide their dislike for each other until it reached a point last week that garcia made a comment with racial overtures about woods . the sergio tiger thing , i mean , it 's stupid , nicklaus said . do guys have an issue one with another ? they usually resolve it themselves . you guys want to resolve it in the newspapers today . nobody needs that . and i think they both finally said , 'it 's enough . forget it , guys . let 's move on . ' in our days , i suppose there were times when you had an issue with somebody and it came about . you never read about it . the woods garcia spat turned ugly last week when garcia was jokingly asked at a european###tour dinner outside london if he would have woods over for dinner during the u.s . open . trying to go along with the sarcasm , the spaniard said he would serve fried###chicken . garcia apologized that night in a statement and the next day in a news conference , though he said he had been unable to reach woods over the phone . woods was asked wednesday if he considered getting in touch with garcia to hear the apology so he would n't have to deal with it during a busy , important week at the u.s . open . what followed were his first public comments , though they were sparse . was i supposed to go to wentworth ? woods said jokingly . asked if he would allow garcia to reach him on the phone to be done with the matter before getting to merion , woods said , that 's already done with . did that mean garcia apologized to him ? not in person , no , he said . when asked if woods considered garcia 's news conference an apology , woods said , move on . on one matter there is no dispute woods is playing some pretty good golf . when all the discord was mentioned , followed by the question of whether it was healthy for golf , woods replied , well , i 've won four times . no one else has more than one win this year , which explains why woods has opened another large lead at no . 1 in the world ranking , and why he is the favorite going into the next major championship . the first stop is muirfield village , were woods is a five time winner . a year ago , woods completed a sunday rally with a chip from behind the 16th green that even nicklaus , the tournament host , called one of the best shots he ever saw under the circumstances . the flop shot behind the green had to be executed to perfection anything too soft would turn away to the left down a ridge and leave some 30 feet for par , while anything too firm might run beyond the hole and off the green into the water . the memorial has the top six players in the world ranking and the strongest field in golf among regular tour events . rory###mcilroy , scott , justin###rose , lee###westwood and brandt###snedeker are all playing . given his history and this golf course it only seems as though it 's woods against everyone else . what is it about the course jack built and the guy who seems to own it ? most golf###courses set up well for tiger###woods , mcilroy said . he 's won the players this year , and that was a golf course that everyone said did n't quite suit him . ... the guy is good wherever he goes and plays . it 's not like he goes to the same course and wins . he can win anywhere . still to be determined is whether he can win at merion . woods made a detour to the course outside philadelphia for his first look at merion , which last hosted the u.s . open in . scott spent two days at merion early last week , while mcilroy is on his way to the u.s . open venue after merion . nicklaus , who played merion twice for a u.s . open and lost in a playoff in 1971 to lee###trevino , said he would be surprised if a player only hit driver once or twice and won . while the middle portion of the course is short even by yesteryear 's standards , the opening and closing stretches are long and tough . woods played in cool temperatures , rain and a strong###wind . it was plenty long when he played , though he does n't think it will be that way in two weeks . what got his attention were some of the winners , notably trevino and ben###hogan . if you look at the list of champions , they have all been really good shot makers , woods said . they have all been able to shape the golf###ball . ... they are very disciplined players . you play to certain spots . you play to certain spots on the greens . you leave yourself certain putts and you deal with it and you move on . this is the first time woods has won four pga###tour events before the memorial , though he won four times ( in consecutive###tournaments ) worldwide in 2008 as his left knee was caving in . all that 's missing is a major woods has been stuck on 14 majors since winning the 2008 u.s . open but it does n't###hurt to keep piling up wins . i 've been saying it a lot the last two or three years . what 's the matter with tiger ? nothing is the matter , davis###love###iii said .
washington sally###jewell , president###obama 's nominee for interior###secretary , deflected many of the questions she faced at her confirmation###hearing thursday but made clear she supports expanded oil and gas development on public###lands and waters , including exploratory###drilling off the north###slope of alaska and seismic testing in the atlantic###ocean . leaning into oil and gas development is an important part of the mission of the bureau###of###land###management and also of the department of interior , ms . jewell said , one of the four times she used a phrase popularized by sheryl###sandberg , the chief###operating###officer of facebook and author of lean in , a book on the challenges confronted by women who are executives . ms . jewell , chief###executive of recreational equipment inc . in seattle , also faced questions on climate###change , protection of endangered###species , energy###development on indian lands and her role as a board###member of a national###parks advocacy###organization . the questions were generally polite from republicans and democrats on the senate energy and natural###resources###committee , and ms . jewell 's responses were for the most part noncommittal . she referred frequently to the need for balance between exploitation of federal###lands for resource###extraction and preservation of wilderness . she also said climate###change was real , but dodged questions about whether she supported a carbon###tax to reduce###emissions of greenhouse###gases responsible for the warming planet . a carbon###tax is not something that would come before me , and the president has made it clear he is not pursuing a carbon###tax at this point , ms . jewell said . she said she supported mr . obama 's so called all of the above energy strategy , including increased###production of oil and gas as well as renewable###energy on public###lands . several republican###senators questioned her about her association with the national###parks###conservation###association , an advocacy###organization for employees and visitors at national###parks . ms . jewell is vice###chairwoman of the board of directors of the group , which frequently sues the department over land use decisions , parks policy and employee rights . senator john###barrasso , republican of wyoming , said her work at the group was unsettling and demanded a pledge that she promise to recuse herself from any legal or regulatory###matters involving it . ms . jewell said she was one of 30 board members and had no authority on matters of litigation . she said that if she were confirmed and issues involving the conservation organization arose she would consult with interior###department ethics officers before taking any action . senator lamar###alexander , republican of tennessee , noted that ms . jewell 's r sum cites her work as a young###woman as a construction###worker on the alaska oil###pipeline , as a petroleum engineer in colorado , as a commercial banker for 19 years and as chief###executive of a billion###dollar company . my question is this , mr . alexander said . how 'd you get appointed by this administration ? you sound more like a nominee of a republican administration . i thought you were going to ask , 'why ca n't you hold a job ? ' ms . jewell responded . many of the committee members asked about home###state issues . senator lisa###murkowski of alaska , the senior republican on the panel , said she was concerned about a recent fish###and###wildlife###service decision to block the building of a gravel airport access###road through the izembek national###wildlife###refuge in the aleutian###islands . ms . murkowski called the decision an example of federal overreach . we need you to affirm that public###lands provide not just a playground for recreational enthusiasts , ms . murkowski said , but also paychecks for countless energy producers , miners , loggers and ranchers .
six years after the great###recession began at the end of , the united###states still has fewer jobs than it did then . that would not be the case but for the unprecedented collapse and slow###recovery of the construction industry . outside construction , there were , 914 , 000 jobs in the united###states in november , according to the bureau###of###labor###statistics , up , 000 , or . 3 percent , from the prerecession peak . but construction employment , which peaked at , 476 , 000 in the spring of , was down 30 percent , to , 435 , 000 , by the time it hit bottom in january . since then , only a fifth of the jobs lost have been recovered , and construction employment stands at , 851 , 000 . during the decline , construction 's share of total employment fell from . 6 percent the highest since 1959 to a low of . 2 percent . that was the lowest figure recorded since world###war###ii . it has since edged back to . 3 percent . as a result , the economy now has , 291 , 000 fewer jobs than it did at the peak , in january . with employment gains averaging nearly , 000 a month over the last year , that implies that the number of jobs in the economy is likely to exceed the old record next june almost six and a half years later . before this , it never took as much as four years for the number of jobs to return to the previous peak , at least since the job figures began to be collected in . construction hiring has not always been a leader in bringing the country out of recession , although it played that role in the mid 1980s . but it had never been such a continuing drag as it has been in the current cycle . there has been some recovery in building , but from very low###levels . the latest available figures show that construction began on , 000 single###family###homes in the most recent 12 months . that is only a few thousand more than the low reached during the 1981 83 recession , when sky high interest rates meant few could afford to buy###homes . as can be seen from the accompanying charts , the three longest and most severe slides in construction employment since , before the current one , ended with employment in the field down 15 to 18 percent . in each case , construction employment had fully###recovered well before this much time had passed . but now , more than seven years after the peak , construction employment is still 24 percent below peak levels . as a result , construction continues to be a drag###on economic###growth as well as employment . before the crisis , construction both residential and nonresidential accounted for . 4 percent of the nation 's gross###domestic###product , the highest###proportion in nearly 30 years . it plunged to half that level in , and has now recovered only to 6 percent . it was never that low before the great###recession , at least since , when the figures began to be calculated . with construction employment remaining low , and with a lot of government infrastructure work needing to be done , including repairing decaying bridges and building new schools , there would seem to be an obvious match that could get needed projects done for less than it would have cost a few years###ago . such work would also lift the economy by putting unemployed people to work . but politically , that seems to be impossible in the current atmosphere . as a result , there is no indication that the construction industry will stop being a drag###on growth anytime soon .
seattle is the only city in the major###leagues that has never hosted the world###series . you might have missed the games in houston , denver and st . petersburg , fla . two apiece during the last decade . washington has gone 80 years without hosting . but at least those cities have taken a turn . not seattle , though , which makes the baseball scene about as different from the bronx as any setting in baseball . when robinson cano departed the yankees on friday to sign a 10 year , 240 million deal with the mariners , pending a physical , he left a franchise with 27 championships . yet as different as the teams' histories have been , the yankees and the mariners have been oddly intertwined for almost two decades , with cano 's defection only the latest example . nearly every major figure in the teams' recent histories has a significant tie to each team 's faraway rival . the mariners , who began play as an expansion###team in , did not have a winning###season until . in a move that evoked george###steinbrenner , they fired their manager , jim###lefebvre , that off season . a year later , they hired lou###piniella . the mariners' top baseball executive at the time , woody woodward , had worked for the yankees and knew piniella well . he gave him a team that included a young slugger , jay###buhner , acquired in an infamous 1988 deal for ken###phelps . piniella , a former yankees outfielder and manager , led the mariners to their first postseason appearance in , winning a one game playoff against the angels . luis###sojo later to have a world###series winning hit for the yankees broke the game open with a three run double . the mariners essentially saved baseball in seattle with a heart pounding five game playoff###victory over the yankees amid the rowdy din of the kingdome . edgar martinez born in new york drove in ken###griffey###jr . to win an epic clincher . the victory was doubly sweet for griffey , who never forgave the boorish treatment he received as a teenager from billy###martin when his father , ken###griffey###sr . , played for the yankees . derek###jeter was inactive for the 1995 playoffs , but the yankees took him to seattle to soak in the charged atmosphere . jeter had made his major###league###debut at the kingdome that may , going 0 for 5 and making one of his outs against jeff###nelson , a future###teammate . the yankees acquired nelson and tino###martinez after the 1995 playoffs , exacting swift revenge on the mariners by giving up only sterling###hitchcock and russ davis in return . the yankees held their prized young core jeter , andy###pettitte , jorge###posada and mariano###rivera although they nearly swapped rivera to seattle the next spring for shortstop felix fermin . the baseball operations department quite wisely persuaded steinbrenner to keep rivera and let jeter take over at short . the yankees went on to win the first of four titles from 1996 through , earning their last pennant in that stretch by beating seattle in a six game american###league###championship###series . the mariners won 116 games the next season , tying an a.l . record , but fell again to the yankees in the a.l.c.s. , this time in five games . their star that season , ichiro###suzuki , stayed with the mariners until , when he was traded , at his request , to the yankees . by then , the yankees had already employed two other famous ex mariners alex###rodriguez and randy###johnson . when he played in seattle , rodriguez had longed to be a star in new york . but he expected to do it with the mets , not the yankees , who had his good buddy , jeter , seemingly entrenched at short . after three years on a lucrative but misguided contract in texas , rodriguez landed with the yankees in 2004 to begin an eventful decade . johnson arrived in a trade from arizona in january , summoned to restore the luster to the yankees' rotation after a catastrophic playoff###loss to boston . johnson had been 5 0 with a . 65 earned###run###average against the yankees in the postseason , and although he won 34 games for them in two seasons , he was winless as a yankee in the playoffs . in , the yankees again looked to a left hander with seattle ties to help lead their rotation . they came tantalizingly close to a trade for the mariners' cliff###lee that july , and when seattle shipped him instead to texas , the yankees fumed . feeling used , they vowed to reconsider future trade relations with the mariners . by january , though , they were at it again , hooking up for what seemed to be a fascinating deal the yankees sent catcher jesus montero , their best prospect , to seattle for pitcher michael###pineda , a young all star . but montero was suspended as part of the biogenesis scandal last season , and pineda has missed two seasons with shoulder trouble . even so , the yankees received a boost in 2012 from a former and future mariner , raul ibanez , who rescued them with several thrilling home###runs , including one in the opener of the a.l.c.s . against detroit . that was the game in which jeter broke his ankle , sending the yankees scrambling for a suitable replacement . the best they found was brendan ryan who came in a trade , naturally , from seattle . with cano on his way there , perhaps the mariners will engineer a turnaround after four consecutive fourth###place seasons

new orleans jim###harbaugh can scream when he is silent and pose questions without words . he can say anything without saying anything . his facial###expressions are part of his charm , a window into his personality and coaching###style , a way for harbaugh to express the full spectrum of human emotion . his san###francisco 49 ers players love to imitate the cartoonish nature of their coach the clenched teeth , the dropped jaw , the wide eyes , the narrowed brow . each has their favorite harbaugh face . take defensive###end aldon###smith . he leaned backward in his chair and scrunched his forehead as if someone had replaced his gatorade with swamp water . his eyes bulged . harbaugh makes this face , smith said , when he disagrees with a referee , when a player###misses an assignment , when an assistant sets him off . it has become his default expression , as omnipresent as his black fleece . that face is the classic , smith said . those harbaugh expressions , the most pronounced element of his animated sideline demeanor , will reach an international###audience sunday in super###bowl xlvii . fans in china and europe are in for some theater , a game of football that prompts a game of charades . harbaugh will smile and mock and rage , appear confused , argue calls , lecture players and applaud touchdowns , and he will do all of this less in the manner of a football###coach and more like a one person play . his parents held a news conference wednesday in which harbaugh 's father , jack , said such emotion , passion and love was passed down from his wife , jackie . someone asked if she ever instructed her sons jim and his brother , john , coach of the baltimore###ravens and jim 's super###bowl coaching counterpart to tone it down . jack , a longtime###coach himself , continued we were around bo###schembechler for a long time , and there were coaches that tried to emulate him . the first time you were n't yourself , you were exposed and somewhat a fraud . so , always be who you are and do n't###follow anyone else . jim###harbaugh certainly heeded that advice . his personality is written all over his face . at media day on tuesday , he sat atop a stage , surrounded by cameras and reporters and comedians and more than a few interviewers dressed in tights . his face registered boredom , happiness and contempt , and sometimes seemingly all three at once . he treated this like any other news conference , with disdain . someone asked about his brother 's clairvoyant powers , an odd question that brought out the jim###harbaugh those in san###francisco know best . he leaned forward . his eyebrows arched . if looks could injure , this one would have hurt . worried about a lot of things , he said , dismissively , as his face appeared to fill with annoyance . i 'm not aware of any clairvoyant powers . no . while entertaining , the many faces of jim###harbaugh represent more than pure theater , according to experts in the art of facial###expression . one is dr . dan###hill , a speaker , author and consultant . years###ago , he watched rafael###nadal in a tennis match and called an upset because nadal 's face showed sadness , and he never shows sadness . sure enough , nadal lost . sports , hill said , can showcase a full range of emotions , like phil###jackson 's mock amusement at a blown call , or bill cowher 's jaw thrust forward as if auditioning to be the fifth face on mount###rushmore . hill 's company , sensory logic , worked with an n.b.a . team , an n.f.l . team before the draft and a major###league baseball###team in regard to its pitchers . then there is harbaugh . for a facial coder like me , hill said , he 's kind of a feast . harbaugh 's signature expression , hill said , is when his mouth drops like an elevator toward the turf in surprise . his eyes seem to double in size . he might look angry , might be angry , but he is also conveying to his players that he cares as much as they do about the result . what hill did not see on harbaugh 's face was disgust or contempt , the kind readily displayed by bill belichick , the famously surly coach of the new england patriots . in the simplest terms , harbaugh 's face says he 's all in , hill said . it shows he 's engaged . none of his players can doubt for a moment that this is a coach who cares . he 's like the ray###lewis of coaches . his emotion also indicates respect .
( reuters ) detroit 's anibal sanchez was denied a no###hitter but still struck out 12 batters in a pitching gem as the tigers sent the minnesota###twins crashing to their 10th straight defeat with a 6 0 victory on friday . sanchez was heading towards a second career no###hitter with one out in the ninth###inning before joe###mauer punched a single up the middle to deny the venezuelan a chance to become the 28th pitcher in major###league history with multiple no hitters . the win catapulted the tigers ( 27 19 ) back to the top of the american###league###central , in front of the cleveland###indians , while minnesota ( 18 27 ) remain rooted to the bottom . detroit 's charge up the standings was aided by boston 's john###lackey , who also pitched an impressive game to lead the red###sox to an 8 1 victory over the indians . lackey allowed just two hits and one unearned###run over seven innings , striking out eight , while mike###carp helped the offence with a three run homer in the second . boston improved to 29 20 to keep pace with the yankees ( 29 18 ) in the american###league###east after the bronx bombers proved too strong for tampa###bay ( 24 23 ) in a 9 4 win . however , it was not all good news for the yankees , who lost curtis###granderson and pitcher david phelps to injuries after both were struck by fast moving balls . granderson suffered a hand fracture and will be sidelined for at least a month while phelps has some bad bruising but should be on the mound for his next scheduled###start . in the national###league , world###series champions san###francisco fell out of a three way tie at the top of the west division with a 5 0 loss to colorado , who remain level with arizona after the diamondbacks beat san###diego . the rockies and diamondbacks improved to 27 21 while the giants slipped back to 26 22 with the loss . washington pitcher jordan###zimmermann grabbed an eighth win of the season as his nationals ( 25 23 ) took down philadelphia .

washington gerry###mcnamara still participates in an occasional practice at syracuse . not far removed from his playing###career , mcnamara is the youngest assistant on coach jim###boeheim 's staff , so the onus often falls on him to get out there and compete . mcnamara enjoys himself for the most part . there are exceptions . for example , he does not particularly relish being guarded by michael###carter###williams , a 6 foot 6 guard with the wingspan of a pterodactyl . so after carter###williams dismantled indiana 's backcourt on thursday in the round of , mcnamara could empathize . i know what it feels like trying to beat him off the dribble , he said . i know what it feels like trying to get a shot off against him . in igniting syracuse 's run to the region final , carter###williams has showcased more than defense . he might own one of the more comprehensive toolboxes in college###basketball defending , scoring , rebounding , passing . not a lot of players can impact the game in every aspect , mcnamara said . and he can . ahead of saturday 's east region final against marquette , carter###williams ranked third in the country in assists . 5 a game ) and fifth in steals . 74 ) . he scored a game high 24 points as fourth###seeded syracuse ( 29 9 ) eliminated no . 1 seeded indiana with startling proficiency . carter###williams has managed to deliver his finest work of the season in the wake of personal adversity . last week , his family 's home in hamilton , mass . , was destroyed in a fire . carter###williams said he lost nearly everything , but he was able to recover a handful of items , including the ring he received as a mcdonald 's all american in . it has not been easy , he said . he tries to compartmentalize his emotions . when it comes time for basketball , he said , everything else is kind of irrelevant . his two seasons at syracuse have been anything but bland . as a freshman , he played###sparingly behind brandon triche , scoop jardine and dion###waiters , who was the fourth pick in last year 's n.b.a . draft . in hindsight , carter###williams said , the experience probably helped him . he added 12 pounds . he watched and learned . he stifled his frustration . as a competitor , i wanted to be out there playing , he said . he has gotten that opportunity this season , though he has not been immune to growing###pains . his perimeter shooting has been an adventure he has shot . 3 percent from 3 point range . errant passes , too , have been an issue . he had eight turnovers against louisville in january . but if some of his plays are high risk ( no look lobs to teammates , then they also are high###reward . he understands the game , he sees the game , and he 's got a great feel for the game , boeheim said . as a high###school player at st . andrew 's school in barrington , r.i. , carter###williams was a potent scorer , finishing with , 260 points . he split time at both guard positions , but his coach , michael hart , said he projected carter###williams as a point###guard in college , figuring that carter###williams 's unusual combination of savvy , skill and size had the potential to make him unguardable too big for small guards , too quick for big forwards . a lot of people see this skinny kid with the baby###face , hart said in a telephone interview . it 's deceptive . carter###williams has a knack for the game 's subtleties passing angles , defensive positioning that he credits to growing up in a basketball family . his mother , mandy zegarowski , coaches high###school basketball in massachusetts . his stepfather , zach zegarowski , was an assistant###coach at charlestown high###school , a powerhouse program just north of downtown boston . his father , earl williams , played###college###basketball . carter###williams said he got regular assessments of his play from all three . pretty much after every game , he said . his recent play has further piqued the interest of n.b.a . scouts . while leaving college early for the draft seems like an increasingly viable###option , carter###williams said he had not decided his future . he cited more pressing business . in anticipation of saturday 's game , carter###williams used the word toughness three , four , five times . on feb . 25 , marquette defeated syracuse , 74 71 , in their only meeting of the season . things could n't have gone much worse for us , he said , adding , we 've###learned from those mistakes .
washington when stephen l . holl , the chief of police at the washington metropolitan airports authority , gathered his staff for the regular morning meeting on monday , he opened with a sobering assessment . it was n't our turn this time , said mr . holl , who oversees security at reagan national and dulles international airports . our turn could be next or it could be never . we believe this could happen any time , he later added . the shooting last week at a security###checkpoint at los###angeles###international###airport that left one transportation###security###administration official dead and two others wounded has security experts re examining strategy for making airports safe , but they say that there are no obvious solutions and that extending any security perimeter raises other problems . wherever you establish a security perimeter , by definition , there 's stuff outside it , said arnold barnett , an aviation security expert at massachusetts###institute###of###technology , explaining why it was hard to guard the people at the gate . placing additional police###officers outside the security perimeter , like at the ticketing area or at the curb , could simply prompt a gunman to go where the officers are not . in a july , 2002 , shooting at the los###angeles airport , a man with a handgun waited until police###officers left the area in front of the el###al airlines ticket###counter before he shot and killed two people and wounded several others . an el###al security guard shot and killed the gunman . the chief of the los###angeles airport police department , patrick gannon , has defended his recent decision to reassign armed###officers from the security###screening area , saying it would allow them to patrol the airport more freely and avoid becoming too predictable . he said the biggest###threats to terminals are from the curb areas to where passengers are screened and he wanted more officers available for those areas . we changed our strategy to a certain degree , chief gannon said . i ca n't###run the same thing every day . he said the redeployment had allowed officers to respond to the shooting within seconds and stop the gunman from harming more people . while interrupting communications among terrorists might provide a way to disrupt their plots , lone gunmen are much tougher to stop , especially if they seem intent on suicide , as many believe was the case with the man suspected in the los###angeles shooting , paul ciancia , who wrote a long note indicating he was targeting t.s.a . officers . chief gannon said monday that mr . ciancia had entered wearing regular clothes and would not have raised suspicion from any officer who saw him . as at many airports across the country , los###angeles airport officials place officers at the curb , primarily to prevent car###bombs . setting up checkpoints at the traffic###lanes leading to the airports , done in times of heightened###tension , would not have helped in this case , experts say . the police at the t.s.a . checkpoints are there mostly to make sure passengers comply with the screeners and to arrest those found to be carrying guns . officials for the union that represents some , 000 t.s.a . agents have renewed their call to give at least some of its members a law enforcement status and allow them to carry###guns . we 're not talking about arming and deputizing everyone , but we need to have a consistent and effective force to back up our officers , said david borer , the general###counsel for the american###federation###of###government###employees . right now it 's left to local###law###enforcement and it 's a real patchwork . it worked this time , but i am not sure if we would have the same response in another airport . some safety specialists have long warned that creating crowds of people at the entrances to the airport gate areas merely moves the area of vulnerability from the planes to a more distant###place arguably safer , because gunfire at a security###checkpoint would not make a plane###crash . researchers are trying to create security systems that would avoid crowds at the checkpoints by allowing###passengers to stroll through , putting their carry ons on a fast moving conveyor###belt . all kinds of things could be happening sniffing for explosives , x rays , body###scanners , or all of the above , said vahid motevalli , a member of a transportation###research###board committee called checkpoints of the future . but that technology is probably quite distant , he said , and if a gunman specifically###targeted t.s.a . agents , even that futuristic checkpoint might not help . marshall mcclain , the president of the airport police union , said the number of officers at the airport had been cut for each of the last three years , making it more difficult to patrol the sprawling area . part of our job is to be a deterrent and one way you 're a deterrent is by being seen , mr . mcclain said . we need to be out there monitoring traffic and have a steady force at all times . dr . motevalli , the associate###dean###for###research and innovation at the tennessee###tech university###college of engineering , said that the los###angeles shooting was different from the terrorism that the existing security protocols were established to combat and had more in common with a workplace or school###shooting in the way the victims were targeted . like others , dr . motevalli said that such attacks predate the t.s.a . and have continued . it 's not politically or religiously motivated , he said . it seems to be mental###illness of some kind . some believe a strong police presence outside the airports' sterile area could scare off attackers or at least end an attack more quickly . paul###hudson , president of the passenger advocacy###group flyersrights . org , said that airport officials should follow the example of grand###central###terminal in new york###city . they have uniformed agents there with essentially uzis , standing around , he said . mr . hudson said such a show of force at airports was in place after the attacks of sept . 11 , 2001 , but was later withdrawn . an official at another airport , who asked not to be named , described such a show of force strategy as scaring the gunman away so he goes to the mall instead . brian michael###jenkins , a former green###beret captain and a security expert at the rand###corporation , argued that increased###security for crowded public###places might not be worth the expense and challenge . if your only achievement is you 've forced your shooter or terrorist bomber to drive three blocks further to another crowded place , that 's not really a net security benefit , he said . if a person is denied###access to a crowded airport , he can go to a train###station , bus###depot , a supermarket , or a theater , as we saw in aurora , colo . , or a shopping###mall , as we saw in nairobi , or times###square .
the chrysler group is bringing to life the advertising theme for its chrysler brand , imported from detroit , through an innovative partnership with a coming broadway show that bears the detroit inspired name of one of the most famous###brands in music . the partnership unites chrysler and motown the musical , about the musical###legacy of berry###gordy and motown , the record###label he founded that is now owned by the universal###music###group . the musical , scheduled to open on april 14 at the lunt fontanne theater , is the beneficiary of an elaborate promotional initiative by the chrysler brand that supplements the show 's own efforts to encourage ticket###sales . the centerpiece of the chrysler brand 's support is a television commercial that has been running nationally since december , featuring mr . gordy riding in a motown edition of a chrysler 300c sedan as the seminal motown song ai n't no mountain high enough plays on the soundtrack . the commercial , created by a chrysler group agency , globalhue in southfield , mich . , begins with mr . gordy at the original hitsville###u.s.a . motown headquarters building in detroit and ends with him arriving at the lunt fontanne and declaring we are motown . and this is what we do . as mr . gordy enters the theater , the chrysler slogan appears , altered to read imported from motown . the words 'motown the musical' on broadway march 2013 appear , referring to the start of previews on march , and the address of the show 's web###site , motownthemusical . com , along with the chrysler brand web###address , chrysler . com . the commercial is believed to be the first time that a broadway show has had such paid national###television exposure as it prepares to open in new york . the commercial is in addition to a commercial that the producers of motown the musical are running on stations in the new york market the local commercial was created by spotco in new york , part of reach4entertainment enterprises . the chrysler brand will also buttress the show 's marketing with colorful signs to go up in coming###days in penn###station and times###square . the signs display a chrysler 300 motown edition , the chrysler logo , the logo of motown the musical and photographs of cast members of the show like brandon victor dixon , who portrays mr . gordy . the chrysler group is spending an estimated 6 million to 8 million to promote motown the musical . the budget for the ads from the show 's producers , mr . gordy , kevin mccollum and doug###morris , is estimated at 2 million . the automaker 's efforts extend beyond the product###placement and sponsorship agreements that have become increasingly###prevalent on broadway as theater enters the realm of so called entertainment marketing with television , movies and video###games . unlike the provisions of many of those deals , the chrysler name is not being added to a lyric of a motown song , nor are there plans to park a car in the lobby of the lunt fontanne . rather , the partnership is about merging both journeys , the journey of the chrysler brand and the journey of mr . gordy and his music , said olivier fran###ois , chief###marketing###officer at the chrysler group . motown is the most exported from detroit of any music and , in this case , imported to new york , mr . fran###ois said . it 's putting together the sound and the drive of detroit . we were meant to meet . that thought is expressed in the national commercial , in which a narrator proclaims , because if cars are our city 's heart , music is its soul . that the partnership is centered on music is no coincidence . mr . fran###ois , a producer of pop###music in his native france in the 1980s , described the motown catalog as part of the american patrimony that will live###forever . and so is chrysler , he said hopefully . regardless of my passion for the motown music and my respect for mr . gordy , i would not have pushed to tie a brand to motown if there was n't this new chrysler story , mr . fran###ois said , referring to imported from detroit , which was introduced in 2011 with a super###bowl###commercial featuring another famous detroit music figure , eminem . the motown name has a huge value , he added . does it have a huge value for any car ? maybe not . mr . mccollum , whose broadway credits include avenue q and rent , invoked another musical to explain how the show and the chrysler group came together kismet . about a year ago , we flew to detroit and sat down with olivier and his team , and they pitched the idea , mr . mccollum said . it 's about a collaboration between these two great###american industries that came out of one place . besides , he added , mr . gordy was highly###influenced by his early###days working in an auto plant , learning that you have to put something out there people want . mr . mccollum said he was glad to join mr . fran###ois and mr . gordy in celebrating detroit when you 'd think it 's contrarian thinking to do so because motown , chrysler and motown the musical are all about the power of the american###dream . the spotco campaign for the show and a public###relations effort by boneau bryan###brown in new york play that up . the local commercial , for instance , extols motown 's songs as the soundtrack that changed america , the beat of a generation , the soul of a nation . the goal is less transactional , said ilene rosen , associate chief###operating###officer at spotco , and more about synergizing the motown and chrysler brands to elevate both . as much as other broadway producers would probably welcome a deep pocketed partner like the chrysler group , the unique###circumstances that produced the partnership may make it difficult to emulate , she added .

mission###viejo , calif . attendees at mark###sanchez 's fourth###annual jets west passing camp each returned###home with an ipad###mini , an adult###size onesie and a nike backpack . they also received three sets of headphones , some funky dress socks and a fancy camera . a water###bottle , a mug , loads of t shirts and shorts , and do n't###forget the frisbee . even a bottle of hand###sanitizer that , in this age of twitter , was splashed with a jetswest hashtag . it was a bounty of souvenirs , but also , perhaps , something else a nice parting###gift . jets west may not even exist next summer , the jets part at least . there could be a jets south in geno###smith 's native florida , depending on the way the quarterback derby and the season at###large unfolds . not that sanchez is thinking that way , of course . asked after friday 's workout here whether he would win the competition , sanchez fixed his eyes on the reporter and said , absolutely . smith was not among the 11 offensive players who carved a few days out of their summer for on field workouts , film sessions and bonding . neither were joe###mcknight , bilal powell , greg###mcelroy and some others , but their absences were not as conspicuous . there are no hard###feelings about anything like that , sanchez said , adding there 's plenty of other things they can be doing . if they can make the sacrifice and be here , awesome . if they ca n't , totally fine . and i 'd never hold a grudge against anybody who 's not here . smith is training in florida , and regardless of the potential###benefits he might have received by flying here to continue developing chemistry with his receivers , there is some merit to his decision to stay back . his appearance would be akin to your drinking a few beers with a colleague the night before you each interview for a promotion to your dream###job . sanchez pointed out that tim###tebow , mark###brunell and kevin o'connell had all attended in the past , but he neglected to mention that none of those three ever posed a credible threat . the atmosphere here is collegial and casual practice closed friday with a water balloon catching contest but there is no mistaking who is in charge . jets west is an opportunity for sanchez to assert his primacy , 800 miles from the team 's headquarters in new jersey , away from the coaches and the support###staff and the front office , even though it could be snatched from him in the next two months . for the last three summers , this camp has served as an affirmation of his job###security he invites his players , to his turf , to a gathering that he and his family organized , so he can review with his teammates the offense that he is seeking to master . that still holds###true , and it is admirable that sanchez added a charitable component . but even if his motives are pure , the amount of work that he put in for this year 's camp is not commensurate with his standing in the organization . he acts like the starter , a sign of confidence as much as defiance , even if he is not anymore . tight###end konrad reuland , who attended mission###viejo###high###school with sanchez , said he 's running the meetings . he 's kind of an extension of the coaching###staff basically when he 's out here . he 's the one running everything and drawing things on the board . i think that 's important . i think guys respect that , putting this on and having us out here . kellen###winslow jr . , who bolstered the jets' tight###end corps when he signed about a month ago , said he was impressed by sanchez 's leadership so far . he handles himself like a pro , winslow said , adding , he knows what everybody 's doing . sanchez said that he was ever more comfortable with the west###coast system espoused by the new coordinator marty###mornhinweg , and that he had spent film sessions answering his teammates' questions . by the very nature of his position , sanchez is expected to lead . there is a lot of support for him in the locker###room , and his teammates respect him and his commitment . no longer does sanchez feel that he enters a huddle and struggles to command attention . it 's becoming more and more natural , he said , and he should feel that way by now . sanchez is entering his fifth season , and with every fumble or dispiriting interception he threw last year , he has moved further and further from the quarterback who held great###promise during the jets' consecutive runs to the a.f.c . championship game . that he has failed to lead with his on field performance is the reason the jets , under their new general###manager , john idzik , selected smith , sanchez 's likely successor , in the second round . you 've got to constantly improve , you 've got to constantly get better , you 've got to make the playoffs , sanchez said . teams that do n't make the playoffs a couple years in a row coaches get fired , players get traded , things###change , organizations blow up and start over . so we 're with a new regime . john idzik wants a quarterback competition . i 'm still here . let 's compete . the jets report to training###camp in cortland , n.y. , on july , and the competition resumes the next day . sanchez guaranteed that he would win , but if he does not , at least his hands will be clean .
a couple of years###ago , when the odd###future major###domo tyler , the creator made his television performance debut on late###night###with###jimmy###fallon , it was a transfixing eruption of untamed energy and nerve , pop savvy and mayhem , ending with his jumping on mr . fallon 's back and grinning for the cameras , a misfit who just ran wild through the castle . earlier this month , odd###future 's earl###sweatshirt made his debut on the same show , performing burgundy , a low###key vamp from his major###label###debut###album doris ( tan cressida columbia , at an energy###level somewhere below simmer . the song its first half , anyway is a strikingly naked admission of stress from an artist whose career###path was largely shaped for him while he was at a boarding###school in samoa during odd###future 's ascent . afraid i 'm going to blow it , he raps at one point . at another i 'm 'bout to relish in this anguish . the contrast was emblematic of the difference between the first and second generations of the recent wave of internet facilitated hip###hop movements the accessible traditionalist who seemed avant at first glance , giving way to the true eccentric who suddenly has a huge stage to shine on . tyler , the creator was able to kick down doors with his charisma and drive , as well as the intensity of his vision , which includes room for an outlandishly gifted solipsist like earl###sweatshirt . a similar dynamic is at play in the rise of asap###ferg , a member of asap###rocky 's extended crew , the asap###mob . over the last couple of years , asap###rocky has reframed the sound of new york hip###hop , borrowing widely from other regional###styles . but with his intense charm and his pinpoint precise aesthetic choices , it was clear almost from the beginning that he was a mainstream rap star in cool kid clothing . asap###ferg , though , is something quite different , as is clear from the new album trap lord ( asap worldwide polo###grounds rca . he 's an experimentalist , the most sonically curious rapper since nicki###minaj , and the possessor of an unusual , winning blend of aggression and artistry . earl###sweatshirt and asap###ferg have little in common aesthetically , but structurally both reflect the influences hip###hop 's progressives have been sorting through in recent###years . both are neck###deep in 1990s aesthetics for earl###sweatshirt , it 's the murky , syllabically dense sounds of that generation 's independent hip###hop for asap###ferg , it 's the flash of the mid 1990s crossover moment , combined with the regional###styles that were taking###shape during that era . odd###future , from los###angeles , and the asap###mob , from new york , developed in parallel , with essentially no overlap . aesthetically , they 're almost at odds . odd###future favors skateboarding , tie###dye , and images of cats with their eyes blacked###out . the asap###mob tends toward rick###owens , gold teeth and silk . but both are modern hip###hop outfits in that they borrow widely , and catholically . both crews were ready made for the tumblr generation of image hounding rebloggers , understanding that building a music career in this era means more than releasing songs , it means delivering a fully packaged worldview . and neither crew would have gotten as far as it did without an intensely magnetic pathbreaker at the foreearl sweatshirt and asap###ferg are both less literal and more inventive than their crews' alphas . their albums are risky and unpredictable , the result of loose cannons allowed to fire freely . doris may be earl###sweatshirt 's highest###profile release , but it is also his most ambivalent . in his earliest songs before odd###future drew any notice , before samoa he was a wisecracking foulmouth interested in pushing the boundaries of language and taste . it made him something of an internet legend , casting an impossibly long shadow . on doris , the wordplay is still intact , but much of the old angst is turned inward . on chum , he tells his story of going astray . it 's probably been 12 years since my father left , left me fatherless and i just used to say i hate him in dishonest jest , he begins , going on to talk about his teenage misanthropy , his struggles to feel###comfortable , his strained relationship with his mother . momma often was offering peace offerings think , wheeze , cough , scoff , and then he 's off again . at the end of the song is a burst of self aware self loathing been back a week and i already feel like calling it quits .
they expect me to arrive in a helicopter , bosworth said , a reference to his famous uncle , brian###bosworth , who in 1987 was transported to his first practice with the seattle###seahawks via helicopter . they expect me to be that flamboyant . but i 'm probably the opposite of that . brian###bosworth was the first pick of the n.f.l . 's supplemental draft in , an all american out of oklahoma with dye in his signature mohawk , a freethinker who became one of the first football players to make himself into a brand the boz . kyle bosworth was undrafted out of u.c.l.a. , but he has already played longer as a pro 25 games than his uncle did , even if he has done it in relative###obscurity as a linebacker and special###teams###player in jacksonville . still , kyle is not without some hollywood trappings . he is engaged to kara keough , daughter of jeana keough , one of the original real###housewives###of###orange###county , a reality###television show that featured kara for several years . the two met as students at u.c.l.a. , but kara is keeping an eye on kyle 's image . when his signing with the giants was announced wednesday###night , it was suggested his career might be summed up as boz ii . keough wrote on twitter , i prefer boz . 0 implies new and improved . whatever form the numbers take , bosworth was just one of roughly 90 giants on the practice###field thursday . he has about three months to prove he can help the giants as an outside or inside###linebacker or as a special###teams###player . he was all three in jacksonville . it is a nice fit , coach tom###coughlin said . multiple###positions and special teams . one thing bosworth apparently will not count on is advice from his celebrated uncle . brian has not had much contact with his nephew since kyle made the jaguars in . i think i got a congratulations message from him when i first signed as a rookie , kyle said , standing in front of a locker with no nameplate over it after practice . but since then , i have n't###heard much . it 's not that we 're not talking it 's just that we do n't really talk . when i was in high###school and college , brian and i were very close . we would talk every few days . but things have happened throughout the family and in his life . things are n't the same now . one of those family situations . bosworth was not always a bosworth . his mother , robbie , who is brian 's sister , was once married to mike###miller . growing up in the dallas area , kyle and his twin###brother , korey , used the last name miller until , even though their parents had divorced when they were young . we wanted to be recruited as individuals and not because of our last name , kyle said . after we signed to go to u.c.l.a . in , we thought it was important to go as bosworth , and we 've been bosworth ever since . kyle bosworth , 26 , has not remained in contact with his biological###father . being a bosworth in the football world has been a mixed blessing , he said . if you have the name and have the talent to back it up , it 's an advantage , he said . if you have the name and do n't have the talent to back it up , then it 's a hindrance . i 've been fortunate to have enough talent to get to the n.f.l. , but it does n't get you anywhere after that . you have to climb the ladder to prove yourself like everyone else . bosworth is 6 foot 1 and 236 pounds and was in on 42 tackles in 25 games during the last two seasons . he started the first five games at linebacker for the jaguars last season but played primarily###on###special###teams the rest of the year . brian helped me and my brother tremendously when we were young he schooled us often , kyle said . but we always knew that would only go so far . he was put on a pedestal . he was a big###deal . but every day , i have to prove myself to the team i 'm playing with , and that 's my reality . as expected , victor###cruz , an unsigned restricted###free###agent , was not at the giants' voluntary off season practice thursday . but in what is a continuing mystery , hakeem###nicks , who is under contract , extended his absence from the sessions . tom###coughlin said that to his knowledge , no one had talked to nicks . coughlin added that nicks had indicated earlier in the month that he was going to attend the practices . ... defensive###linemen justin###tuck and jason###pierre###paul were also missing , although coughlin said that they had informed the giants beforehand that they would be absent . coughlin said he expected both players back on the field friday . ... bear pascoe , primarily a tight###end , has taken over so far as the first string fullback . last year 's starter , henry hynoski , injured his left knee last week and could be out until the regular###season###opener or longer .
washington if there was a symbol on tuesday of america 's pent up frustration with a gridlocked political system , it was this scores of aging world###war###ii and vietnam###veterans pushing past barricades to honor their fallen###comrades at a memorial closed by a government###shutdown . the veterans arrived in washington from mississippi and iowa , having spent thousands of dollars to charter honor flights to the capital . but like those of many others across the country , their plans collided with the reality of a congress frozen by ideological disputes and unable to agree on how to keep the government open . lawmakers helped the veterans get past the barriers , but others around the country were not so lucky as tourists were blocked from their destinations and more than , 000 federal###employees were told to stay###home . cleveland faggard , 89 , of moss###point , miss . , who had been an aviation machinist for the navy , had helped###push past a black###metal blockade after about a dozen republican members of congress arrived , responding to e mailed pleas from the veterans . i was just praying to the lord , mr . faggard said . he took care of it . around the country , barricades and padlocks closed off access to federal facilities as the vast machinery of the federal###government began systematically shutting down operations for the first time in nearly two decades . employees feared they could be out of work for weeks , and many of them were angry . once the mortgage payment comes around and i do n't get the paycheck , it 's going to be a problem , said sherilyn garnett , 44 , a federal###prosecutor from altadena , calif . it 's stupid . it 's really stupid . in washington , tina miller , who works in law enforcement for the federal###government , said the shutdown would have a wide impact . it 's going to have effects for everybody and the community , everything , she said . i 'm not sure why they would n't think of that . americans seeking a variety of services at federal buildings found the doors shuttered , with no indication of when they might reopen . when sheila caraway , 23 , arrived at the internal###revenue###service office in downtown###los###angeles , she was turned away by a security officer who explained that parts of the government had been shut down . she left the i.r.s . without the tax###refund that she had hoped would help pay for her cable###tv bill . this is crazy . i do n't like it . it 's been over a year , and i have n't gotten my refund , ms . caraway said , explaining that she had not followed the recent political struggles in washington . i think everyone is crazy right now . among the most noticeable impacts of the first shutdown of the internet era many complex government web###sites were suddenly replaced by one page notices like the one at census . gov , which declared that due to the lapse in government funding , census . gov sites , services , and all online###survey collection requests will be unavailable until further notice . the reality of the shutdown began to become clear early tuesday . children 's playgrounds in small pocket###parks around capitol###hill were closed . the military service###academies suspended all intercollegiate###sports competitions . the national zoo 's online panda cam stopped###showing images of mei xiang 's latest cub . officials stopped giving tours of alcatraz prison in san###francisco###bay . at the statue of liberty in new york , tourists from norway and beijing were prevented from getting close to the monument of freedom . haiyan wang 's 9 year old nephew , tony , had been wanting to go inside the statue of liberty for a long time , ms . wang said tuesday###morning at liberty###state###park in jersey###city . she said her visiting###relatives did not really comprehend what had happened in washington because the chinese government never closes down . mail###delivery continued as usual , financed by fees rather than the federal###budget . amtrak trains continued to run and officials said meat inspectors , border###control agents and transportation###security###administration screeners would stay on the job . after a general retreat on monday , global###investors reacted calmly on tuesday in the hours after congressional negotiations collapsed , as investors focused on the oct . 17 deadline for raising the debt###ceiling . stocks on wall###street closed slightly###higher , while european and asian stocks were mixed . bond and foreign###exchange###markets were quiet . those looking for financial###data to assess the impact of a shutdown will have to do it without help from the congressional###budget###office and the census###bureau , both of which are closing . the bureau###of###labor###statistics , which is scheduled to issue its monthly jobs report this friday , is also closing and said the jobs report would most likely be postponed . the consumer###product###safety###commission said it would stop recalls of products that do not present an imminent###threat to consumer safety . the food###and###drug###administration , which inspects the majority of food americans eat , suspended routine establishment inspections and monitoring of imported foods and drugs . the centers###for###disease###control furloughed about 68 percent of its staff and said the shutdown would significantly###reduce its capacity to respond to food borne illnesses and disease###outbreaks . federal###communications###commission officials said the agency would send all but about 38 of its , 716 employees home for the duration of the shutdown . at the justice###department , attorney###general eric h . holder jr . pledged to give back a portion of his salary in solidarity with his employees . meanwhile , a federal###judge denied a shutdown related request from the department of justice to delay the antitrust case merger trial of american###airlines and us airways , citing the need for an expeditious trial . traveling on tuesday in seoul , south###korea , secretary of defense chuck###hagel called the shutdown nonsensical and needless and said it would lead to the immediate furlough of about , 000 civilian employees . ( mr . obama signed###legislation late monday###night ensuring that uniformed members of the military will get paid during the shutdown . ) it does cast a very significant pall over america 's credibility with our allies when this kind of thing happens , mr . hagel told###reporters . officials informed lawmakers that about 72 percent of the intelligence###community 's civilian work force were furloughed . senator dianne###feinstein , democrat of california , angrily denounced the shutdown as the biggest gift that we could possibly give our enemies . the crowds were lighter than normal early tuesday at l'enfant###plaza in washington , where there are a number of federal###agencies . phillip davenport , a management analyst at the federal###aviation###administration , who was deemed an essential employee , said he was expecting a heavier workload . during the last shutdown 17 years###ago , mr . davenport was on active###duty in the military , based in alaska , he said . back then , i do n't###remember for sure , but we came to work regardless of whether we were paid or not , he said . about 8 a.m. , the steps of the lincoln###memorial were being taped off by national###park police , metal barricades were erected and tourists were being turned away . across washington , commercial###establishments sought###ways to try to minimize the impact , with bars and restaurants advertising shutdown specials . at z burger , a popular restaurant in the washington area , owners pledged to make good on their promise for a free burger for every furloughed federal worker . in a twitter post , it said almosthere if governmentshutdown free burgers . reporting was contributed by dan frosch from denver patrick mcgeehan from new jersey kim severson and alan###blinder from atlanta jennifer steinhauer from seoul , south###korea emmarie huetteman , ron nixon , charlie###savage , eric schmitt and ashley southall from washington jad mouawad and malia wollan from san###francisco ian lovett from los###angeles and victoria shannon from new york . this article has been revised to reflect the following correction an earlier###version of this article misspelled the name of a panda at the national zoo . it is mei xiang , not mei xian .
santa###monica , calif . a conversation with j . j . abrams is more like a series of interruptions and distractions , punctuated by occasional exchanges of dialogue . the latest diversion to appear on his iphone screen one evening in march , as he unwound here at the offices of his bad robot production###company , was a photograph sent by his producing###partner , bryan###burk , of two tip jars side by side on a coffee###shop counter one labeled star###wars , and the other star###trek . here , in a discussion about his ever expanding film and television empire , mr . abrams , 46 , the prolific director and producer , had to stop and laugh at this encapsulation of his world , and a seemingly one or the other decision he faces . life would be challenging enough for mr . abrams as he puts the finishing###touches on star###trek###into###darkness , the long###awaited sequel to his 2009 reboot of star###trek , which paramount will release on may . the arrival of mr . abrams 's first star###trek film , which cast fresh faced actors like chris###pine and zachary###quinto in the roles of kirk and spock , did more than revitalize this dormant , decades old space adventure series . it vaulted mr . abrams , a creator of television shows like lost and alias , into the vanguard of directors who could successfully###run the summer movie spectacles that are the lifeblood of hollywood studios . then , just as he was settling into his captain 's chair on the starship###enterprise , mr . abrams rocked the geek###culture universe with the announcement , after some feints and misdirection , that he will be directing a seventh film in the rival star###wars saga , planned for . it is an assignment mr . abrams , who grew up in los###angeles obsessed with movies like star###wars and jaws ( not to mention the philadelphia story and ordinary people , said he could not pass up . but no one in his camp least of all mr . abrams himself knows how this choice will affect the new star###trek movie or a director who never met a vintage action franchise he could resist . there are , i 'm sure , people who would say i 've never been very good at anything , mr . abrams said , speaking in a fast###slow fast , start###stop start delivery that mirrors his work habits . but i 've also never been very good at focusing on one thing . it just seems to be my mo . in a somewhat softer tone , he added i know that we all have our capacity , and at a certain point it 's going to be too much . when mr . abrams 's original star###trek sold 385 million in tickets worldwide , it created the expectation that he would promptly reunite his creative###team and get to work on a sequel , and this raised problems . first was the question of whether mr . abrams and his collaborators formerly outsiders who had to prove to audiences that they could take over star###trek , now its established stewards could surpass themselves in a second go round . when you 're operating from a place of , 'we trust you now , ' there 's much further to fall , said damon###lindelof , a writer and producer of star###trek###into###darkness and a creator of lost . i always like operating from a place of lowered expectations . narratively , mr . abrams 's star###trek used a sly time travel subplot to establish its young starfleet officers without annihilating the 40 years of story###lines that preceded the film . but it also destroyed spock 's home###planet of vulcan an occurrence that mr . lindelof called our 9 11 event in the 'trek' verse and this seemed to demand further consequences in the sequel . into darkness delivers this retribution through a new nemesis played by benedict###cumberbatch , the star of sherlock , whose vendetta against starfleet hints at a more complicated agenda behind his murderous acts . the reasons for terrorism in any situation are a little more complicated than someone just hating our freedom , said roberto###orci , who wrote star###trek with alex###kurtzman , and who both return on into darkness . we wanted the villain to be equally nuanced , to the point where some might not even call him a villain . but in the years since the first film , gathering the star###trek brain###trust in the same room became an exponentially complicated task . mr . lindelof was finishing lost and working on the science###fiction thriller prometheus mr . kurtzman and mr . orci were producing their own projects , including mr . kurtzman 's feature directing debut , people like us and mr . abrams was making his coming of age fantasy super . the uncertainty of whether mr . abrams would direct this sequel was perhaps the greatest###challenge of all in a positive way , his writers say . our collective goal , mr . kurtzman said , was to make it something he would want to do . this strategy seemed to win over mr . abrams , who spoke about into darkness as if it were a spiritual###quest or lifesaving surgery . despite wanting to do other things , he said , suddenly i found myself feeling like , 'i cannot not direct this movie . i cannot pass this up . ' to the outside world and to paramount the path to this inevitable result could at times look like frustrating procrastination . mr . burk said , i would routinely get calls from the studio asking for confirmation that he was directing the movie , and we never really confirmed it . we just kept going forward . but to those who have spent time around mr . abrams , who has tantalizing options dangled in front of him almost every minute of every day , this is all part of what mr . lindelof described as life in a j . j . culture .

foxborough , mass . he figured he would at least play . that much shane###vereen thought he could count on for the patriots ' playoff opener sunday against the houston###texans . he had earned that much with his play during the regular###season , had n't he ? this was n't , when he was a rookie running back out of california , appearing in just five games , bothered by a hamstring injury . this time last year he was a spectator when new england made its run to the super###bowl in indianapolis . this time around , if the patriots are to get to another super###bowl and they are one home###victory from a trip to new orleans vereen plans to be a lot more than just your basic wallflower . he signaled his arrival sunday against the texans , shining brightly in the constellation of new england stars in a 41 28 victory . in his first n.f.l . playoff###game , vereen scored###three###touchdowns , two on pass###receptions . he had 124 all purpose yards . he rushed for 41 yards on seven carries , scoring on a 1 yard run . shane had a great###game , patriots quarterback tom###brady said , really just a huge growing up moment for him . but the way vereen saw it , he was doing what every patriot does when called upon the job they pay you to do . nothing more . nothing less . guys go down , guys step in , vereen said . that 's what you 're expected to do . then , in a rare moment of non patriot speak , he acknowledged , yeah , it was a fun game for me . vereen got the call when the starter , danny###woodhead , hurt his thumb on the patriots' first play from scrimmage . before the game , vereen had no idea how much he would play , if he would even get a carry or be targeted by brady coming out of the backfield . he got all of that and more . woodhead did not return . the patriots went three and out on that series , but when they reassembled for their next series , vereen was in the backfield . we hate to lose woody , vereen said . he is such a key part of our offense . but at the same time , all of the running###backs hold ourselves accountable to be able to step up when somebody does go down . if he was stunned or shocked to be in there so soon , it did not show . in contrast to last season , he was ready for prime time . he missed the first three games and then appeared in the final . he had three rushing###touchdowns and one memorable 83 yard pass reception for a touchdown against the jets on thanksgiving night . he was in the mix in . he was also part of a four headed running monster as the patriots had one of their best running seasons in years and stevan###ridley amassed the fourth###highest rushing###total , 263 yards ) in franchise###history . vereen and ridley shared the running duties against the texans , and each averaged . 5 yards a carry or better . ridley ( 82 yards on 15 carries ) finished with just 8 fewer yards and 7 fewer carries than his texans counterpart , arian###foster . ridley had one of the patriots' five touchdowns , an 8 yard burst in the third quarter that gave new england a 24 13 lead . but the deal clincher of the game came courtesy of vereen , who took advantage of an isolation play on texans linebacker barrett ruud . brady laid out a perfect float pass , and vereen , a step ahead of ruud , pulled it in , tumbling into the end###zone . the touchdown , vereen 's third of the game , gave new england a 38 13 lead less than three minutes into the final###quarter . i do n't know if that was the dagger , vereen said . their offense was still producing . it was a good call and we executed it . the matchup is in my favor , so i have to do a great job of getting open . when your number is called , you 're expected to go out there and execute , to do well . or , as coach###bill###belichick said these kinds of games , you never really know when the dial spins , where it 's going to wind up , who it 's going to end up on . those guys were prepared . vereen also benefited from the patriots' emphasis on the running###game in . they finished###seventh in rushing in the n.f.l . and third in the a.f.c . ridley was the conference 's third leading###rusher and seventh over all . the team had 151 rushing first downs , second most in franchise###history . brady attempted 40 passes sunday , while ridley and vereen accounted for 22 rushes . ridley was a force in the third quarter ( 49 yards ) and then was a plow horse in the fourth when the patriots were running out the clock . new england will host the ravens on sunday and are likely to be without tight###end rob###gronkowski , who may have broken his arm again . the status of woodhead was unknown . but vereen and ridley will be back for a crack at the super###bowl . they may not get the attention of the more marquee members of the offense , but they have shown that they can be every bit as critical .
gifts surrounded mariano###rivera 's locker , besieging his little alcove in the clubhouse . framed posters and plaques , bags of t shirts , bats , trophies , bins of mail , all of it piled like presents around a christmas###tree . rivera , a model of neatness and simplicity , the master of the cutter , needed help controlling the clutter . rivera nodded , and several cardboard###boxes were loaded into a laundry cart and wheeled away . rivera tried to dress quickly and quietly before his big day , mariano###rivera day at yankee###stadium , but visitors kept interrupting to offer congratulations or thanks . the outpouring of affection was only beginning sunday . it carried on for hours , a daylong jubilee of recognition and remembrance for rivera and andy###pettitte , but the san###francisco###giants ultimately###turned the lights out on the party with a 2 1 win . the yankees' already slim postseason hopes were left in deeper jeopardy . an afternoon to savor quickly###turned bittersweet . how it finished was n't what i was looking for , rivera said . the loss put the yankees four games back in the race for the second american###league wild###card spot with six games to play . afterward , manager joe###girardi did not mince words the yankees cannot afford another loss . it 's difficult , girardi said . seeing all the players and people who came back and the crowd today , it 's difficult . this team has fought all year long , and we 're going to have to continue to do it . trailing by a run in the eighth , the yankees put two runners in scoring###position with nobody out . but two runners were thrown out at home , including robinson cano on a magnificent throw from left###fielder juan perez to end the threat . cano appeared to roll his ankle running on the play , but the third base coach , rob thomson , said he had no hesitation sending him with two outs . if that was the last out of the world###series , i 'd send him every time , thomson said . with an hourlong pregame ceremony , dozens of video tributes , special logos on the bases and the yankees' hats , and a white 42 painted along each baseline , it was quite easy to forget that pettitte was saying farewell to the home###fans as well . pettitte never intended to tiptoe in on rivera 's parade officially###declared mariano###rivera day by mayor michael r . bloomberg but his scheduled###start happened to coincide . over lunch in toronto , it was rivera who mentioned to pettitte that he should not wait any longer to announce his retirement . the two yankees stalwarts could share sunday 's spotlight . pettitte almost snatched it himself . he took a no hit bid into the sixth###inning before a solo home###run by the rookie shortstop ehire adrianza tied the score at . i hate to even say it , at this point , i really do n't know if my body would even allow me to pitch nine innings , pettitte said . it was good to dream and think about it . pettitte allowed a leadoff double in the eighth to pablo###sandoval , and he was removed to a standing###ovation and a curtain call . derek###jeter greeted him on the top step of the dugout for an embrace . dave###robertson , though , could not preserve the tie , allowing a double by tony abreu two batters later that gave the giants the lead . it 's the worst###case###scenario five pitches , and i was out , robertson said . i feel like i let everybody down . rivera entered the game breaking adrianza 's bat with his second pitch and worked a scoreless one and two thirds innings . but the yankees' offense again failed to come through . in the eighth , the yankees put two runners into scoring###position with nobody out . but on a hard grounder to third by alfonso###soriano , zoilo almonte was thrown out at home . curtis###granderson then struck out for the second out . eduardo nunez followed with a single to left###field , and cano appeared on his way to scoring from second . perez 's throw , however , cut him down . sergio###romo polished off the ninth###inning for his 36th save . afterward , surrounded by his wife and children , pettitte said he thought the yankees would ride the wave of emotions to a much needed victory . it always seems to happen , you know ? pettitte said . i really thought it was going to happen again today . it 's hard to believe that we 're sitting here and that we lost another game . this was a big loss . girardi and rivera said that rivera would have gone out to pitch the 10th inning if the yankees had come back to tie . you just want to go and help the team as much as you can , rivera said . i was ready for that , but unfortunately , nothing happened . the game was not the last chance for rivera to pitch at yankee###stadium . he has three more opportunities , against the tampa###bay###rays starting tuesday , to make an appearance . the yankees will continue to hold out hope that there will be postseason life , too . but with another loss , that hope gets dimmer . joe###girardi said sunday that the yankees would start the right hander hiroki###kuroda on tuesday against the rays , skipping phil###hughes and david huff in the rotation .
the canadian###soccer###association on monday suspended the quebec soccer federation , which oversees leagues of all ages in the province , after it refused###to###comply with a national directive permitting players who wear turbans to participate in games . a spokeswoman for the national###governing###body said it sent a memo to all of its local###associations in april , affirming its position that turbans and two other types of headwear patkas and keski were allowed to be worn by players . that provision was successfully###applied everywhere in canada , the spokeswoman said , except for quebec the quebec soccer federation , known as f.s.q. , voted earlier this month to ban such headwear , saying it was concerned that it presented a safety issue . brigitte frot , the director general of the f.s.q. , told###reporters last week that she was unaware of any injuries directly caused by players wearing turbans , but believed they should be banned anyway . asked during a teleconference what she would say to a young###child who was unable to play because of the rule , she said they can play in their backyard , but not with official referees , not in the official rules of soccer . they have no choice . aneel samra , an 18 year old student from montreal who was affected by the ban on turbans , called frot 's comments one of the most disrespectful things i 've###ever###heard . in an interview tuesday , samra added i 've###played for 11 years , but this year i did n't even register because they told me i could n't###play . it 's ridiculous . frot and other f.s.q . officials were not made available for comment tuesday . leaders of the organization were said to be planning a meeting for tuesday###night to discuss the suspension . frot previously said her organization was taking its direction from fifa , the governing###body of world soccer , which does not clearly state that turbans are allowed . critics of the f.s.q . 's decision note , however , that fifa , which has explicit###rules regarding uniforms , also does not unequivocally ban turbans in the way that it does , say , jewelry . many other countries , including the united###states , allow players to wear turbans and other religious head###coverings , like skullcaps , as long as the referee does not deem them to be dangerous . the turban ban has played out against a familiar backdrop . quebec 's french speaking###majority long###ago went from being dominated politically and socially by the roman###catholic###church to being the most secular people in canada . only about 15 percent of quebecers attend###church , and most people in the province long###ago rejected its teachings on birth###control , same###sex###marriage and abortion . but the question of how to deal with immigrants' cultural religious###practices remains a thorny issue in the province , where there are about , 200 sikhs , according to recent census data . months of public###hearings on the subject in 2007 and 2008 showed that many french###speaking quebecers felt anxious that their identity and language would be threatened by making allowances for the ways of others . the special commission called that a crisis of perception , and the evidence###suggested that the worry was strongest in parts of the province with relatively few immigrants . daniel weinstock , a philosopher and a professor at mcgill###university 's law###school in montreal , said the fact that the soccer federation 's bans largely involved children 's play have made them stand out . even if the motivations of the federation are completely###innocent and bureaucratic , this has been set into a toxic culture of us and them , weinstock said . after initially staying out of the turban debate , quebec 's separatist parti###qu###b###cois###government took the side of the federation tuesday . speaking to reporters , pauline###marois , the quebec###premier , avoided discussing the safety issues . she turned the issue instead into an example of canada unjustly telling quebec what to do , a common###theme of the separatist###movement . i think the quebec federation has the right to establish its own regulations , she said . it is autonomous , not subject to the canadian federation . soccer was at the center of another accommodation debate during those hearings after the quebec federation in 2007 banned the use of hijabs , muslim head scarfs , from play , a move matched by the province 's taekwondo federation . then , as now with turbans , safety was the soccer federation 's ostensible concern . the hijab ban was finally###lifted last year . the canadian###soccer###association 's suspension of the fsq does not affect the montreal###impact , who play in major###league###soccer , but it does affect some youth teams , including all star teams that compete outside the province . in addition , if the suspension continues through the summer , teams from quebec will not be allowed to compete in canada 's national###championships . further , nationally certified referees are prohibited from working games in quebec . balpreet singh , who serves as legal###counsel for the world sikh organization of canada , said his organization had been attempting to address the issue with the f.s.q . for years . singh said in an interview tuesday that his organization initially protested to the federation in 2007 when it would not allow a girl to play soccer because she was wearing a hijab . in , singh said , a referee in quebec was not allowed to officiate because she was wearing a hijab . last year . the policy disallowing turbans was unofficially instituted . we have reached out with letters and phone calls , and have received no response , not one , from the quebec soccer federation , singh said , adding that his organization would consider legal###action if the f.s.q . did not reverse its decision . we 're not asking anyone else to wear a turban , singh said . we 're not trying to give a message through our turban . it 's a personal###expression of faith that is absolutely essential . but it 's not something that imposes a message on anyone else . it 's not something that should keep anyone from playing a game .
tuscaloosa , ala . the man they call tha monstar walked into alabama 's football complex last month as if bound for a biker bar . tattoos covered most every inch of his wide frame . he wore his hair carved down the center , into a mohawk . he carried an oakland###raiders knitted cap . his name is jesse williams , mr . monstar to the uninitiated , nose###tackle for the mighty crimson###tide . three words best summarized his aura extremely###bad man . too easy , he said by way of introduction , substituting a favorite catchphrase for hello . his story , though , is not easy . it is more complicated , more nuanced , his path to stardom as improbable and distinct as any in college sports . it wound from eastern###australia to the arizona desert to the most storied program in the south . it included three sports , a chance###encounter with an american coach , multiple position changes , walmart , panda###express and dozens of tattoos . the tattoos alone help tell his story . they provide an outline of sorts , complete with inspirational quotations and mantras and tribal symbols . from the right side of his head ( fear is a liar ) to his right hand ( i stopped checking for the monster under the bed when i realized the monster is me ) to his right earlobe ( smiley###face , williams turned body###art into his preferred method of self expression . for a tale worthy of a book , he already wrote one an autobiography , with pictures . before this season , he added champs , in all capital letters , with a crimson a for alabama , a nod to the national###championship he secured last year with the crimson###tide . should alabama repeat , against notre###dame in miami on monday###night , additional ink will be all but required . in a game likely to be decided by the big###boys in the middle , he should figure prominently in the outcome . williams moved from defensive###end to nose###tackle for alabama 's title###defense . he anchored a unit as dominant as any in college###football . he confronted at least two blockers on most plays , clearing space for three linebackers to lead the crimson###tide in tackles . he served as the lead fullback in alabama 's offensive jumbo package . he could have also kicked field goals and extra###points if needed , williams said , even at 6 feet 4 inches and some 320 pounds . such versatility underscored williams 's eclectic personality , his play on the field as varied as his interests . asked if he had ever met anyone like williams , center barrett###jones laughed . he then told a story about how williams went to his parents' house for dinner on williams 's official visit to alabama , how they found williams more engaging than intimidating , how after williams left they said both , wow , he 's an interesting looking guy and he 's nice . sometimes , williams wonders how he ended up here , in the united###states , 9 , 000 miles from home , on a football field , one win from his second national###title . now that is a tale worthy of some ink . he first noticed american###football about age 15 when various n.f.l . jerseys became part of the fashion scene in brisbane , where he grew up . soon afterward , he spied the game on television for the first time . he wondered why the players###wore all that equipment and why they stopped so frequently . the rest of what he knew he learned through films like any given sunday and the waterboy . back then , williams played###basketball and rugby , his rare combination of size and speed and power the perfect###blend for both sports . williams can still dunk and does in the off season on students at alabama 's recreation###center . he tried football for a local###team at the urging of a friend . he played center , tight###end and running back before settling at middle###linebacker , where he liked the way it felt to hit people . what little equipment he did wear hardly fit . at that point , australians who played###football in the united###states mostly kicked or punted , a result of skills honed from birth by training in rugby and australian###rules###football . williams insisted he could have joined those ranks . he said he regularly booted 50 yard field goals indoors , in his defensive###lineman 's cleats , and he goofs around with the specialists most days before practice , offering###advice . instead , he was discovered by jerry dominguez , the defensive###coordinator at the junior###college arizona western . williams played for the australian junior###national###team , which asked dominguez to fly over and conduct drills with heavy emphasis on technique as it prepped for an important contest against new zealand . dominguez watched williams , how he carried around a notepad and continued to scribble in the margins , so studious even as he called his new cleats boots . the week culminated with the game . williams recorded three sacks , blocked multiple field goals and won most###valuable###player###honors . dominguez offered a scholarship . williams , already graduated from high###school and working as a professional landscaper after an offer to attend hawaii fell through , accepted .
new york adam###wainwright used to be a creature of routine leading up to each start . same sleeping shirt the night before , the st . louis###cardinals ace said . i could n't wear###blue jeans . i had to wear the color red . are you kidding me ? it was ridiculous . if i did n't have any of that , or worse , if something was thrown off , then instantly i was thinking , 'oh , man , i 'm in trouble . ' and that 's ridiculous . it has nothing to do with getting anyone out . i figured that out somewhere along the line . with rain falling in the morning and clashing forecasts for the afternoon , wainwright was n't sure whether he 'd pitch at all thursday . cardinals manager mike###matheny told him about 80 minutes before start time to get ready , so wainwright shortened his pregame routine and then pitched seven scoreless###innings to become the major###leagues' first 10 game winner . in a classic pitching matchup , his 2 1 victory over the new york mets sent matt###harvey to his first loss of the season . we had two cy###young candidates going at each other , said matt carpenter , who tripled in the go ahead run in the third and preserved the lead with a sparkling stop at second base in the ninth . some forecasts had predicted up to 3 inches of rain . two days###ago , they were talking about we were going to need to build an ark , matheny said . that 's tough on the starting###pitcher . as he 's walking through here an hour and a half before the game , he 's completely out of his routine because he 's hearing conflicting###stories of what 's going to happen with weather . but he got his mind together and got into an abbreviated###version of his routine and went out and executed . after expecting a rain delay , wainwright did his preparation and warmup kind of a ground routine it 's not gymnastics , it 's just stretching in the clubhouse instead of on the field . my whole normal pregame routine was kind of thrown out the window , he said . wainwright ( 10 3 ) retired his first 11 batters before david###wright 's single and allowed four hits , struck out six and walked two including an intentional pass that caused the mets to pinch hit for harvey in the seventh . he tied his career best by winning his fifth straight start , dropped his era to . 18 and got his , 000th strikeout when wright was called out on a first inning curveball . it was n't much fun to be an offensive###player today , wright said . known best in new york for freezing carlos beltran with a called third strike to end game 7 of the 2006 nl championship###series , wainwright had been 0 4 with an . 46 era in four starts against the mets since his only career###win against them , in st . louis on april , 2010 . i had everybody in the world tell me i had never beat the mets at their stadium , so it was something i wanted to do , wainwright said . trevor###rosenthal pitched the eighth , and edward###mujica allowed a long home###run to marlon###byrd with one out in the ninth . john###buck doubled and took third as kirk nieuwenhuis grounded to carpenter , who made a diving backhand stop as he fell and threw to first for the out . when it was hit , i thought he had a good chance of getting a base hit up the middle . carpenter said . josh satin fouled off two full count pitches and swung over a splitter as mujica remained perfect in 19 save chances . harvey ( 5 1 ) had given up one run and five hits in seven innings with seven strikeouts and a walk , ending a 14 start unbeaten###streak dating to sept . 12 but lowering his era to . 04 . he 's as good as you 're going to face in the big###leagues , carpenter said . he 's got electric stuff . harvey had no decisions in eight of his previous nine starts , and the mets have scored just 18 runs while he 's been in the game during his last 10 outings , according to stats . if i go seven zeros , we 're still playing the ballgame . harvey said . it 's an incredible lineup . you really have to be locked in one through nine . st . louis went ahead in the third when pete###kozma hit an opposite field single to right for the first hit of the game and carpenter tripled past byrd , who tried for a sprawling catch in right but allowed the ball to bounce past him . new york 's bullpen gave up a run in the eighth , when carpenter and beltran singled off scott rice , and matt###holliday and allen###craig singled against latroy###hawkins . a day of dazzling defense included craig 's diving stop at first base in the eighth to rob omar quintanilla of a hit , two nifty pickups by daniel descalso on slow rollers to third in the seventh and a pair of challenging catches by center###fielder john###jay . he ran to the warning###track for lucas###duda 's two out drive with a runner on second in the fourth and nabbed a wind blown drive by jordany valdespin leading off the sixth . next month , wainwright and harvey could find themselves in the same clubhouse at citi###field on the nl all star team . that 's a long time from now , wainwright said . i 've got to get a lot of different hitters out before i start worrying about all star hitters . notes st . louis took two of three in the series and improved the big###leagues' best record to . ... craig has 49 rbis . ... kozma had three of the cardinals' 10 hits .

in a letter to james b . comey , president###obama 's nominee for f.b.i . director , two democratic###senators expressed###concern on wednesday about mr . comey 's views on waterboarding and his role in approving enhanced###interrogation###techniques while at the justice###department in the george w . bush###administration . the senators , richard j . durbin of illinois and sheldon###whitehouse of rhode###island , said they wanted to know mr . comey 's position on an issue of great###importance to our nation torture . both senators are on the judiciary committee , which is scheduled to hold a confirmation###hearing on the nomination on tuesday . their views reflect uneasiness among senate democrats about mr . comey 's record on the divisive issue of interrogation###methods . both men voted against confirming mr . bush 's last attorney###general , michael b . mukasey , in part because he declined to describe waterboarding as torture . their letter asked mr . comey to provide written answers###to###questions about his role at the bush justice###department in the authorization of the coercive interrogation###methods and about whether he considers waterboarding to be torture . both mr . obama and attorney###general eric h . holder jr . have said they believe it is torture . mr . comey , 52 , is a republican who served as deputy###attorney###general from 2003 to . he is most famous for taking a stand in 2004 at the bedside of his ailing boss , attorney###general john###ashcroft , against what he considered to be unlawful excesses in the national###security###agency 's collection of internet data on americans . later , after changes were made in the rules , he signed off and the collection resumed . his views on the brutal interrogation###methods adapted by the central###intelligence###agency after the 2001 terrorist attacks appear to have been similarly mixed . according to documents and e mails from , mr . comey expressed###concern about the methods but also gave his approval to a legal###opinion approving them . waterboarding , in which water is poured over a prisoner 's nose and mouth to give a sensation of drowning , was used on a small number of qaeda suspects in 2002 and . the method was long labeled torture by the united###states and was used by , among others , the spanish###inquisition and pol###pot 's government in cambodia , but bush justice###department lawyers decided it was not illegal when used within certain limits . in an e mail in april , mr . comey gave his assent to a justice###department legal###opinion that authorized the c.i.a . to use 13 interrogation###methods , including waterboarding and up to 180 hours of sleep###deprivation . the opinion was ready to go out and i concurred , mr . comey wrote to a colleague in an april , 2005 , e mail message obtained by the new york times . but he said in the e mail that he disagreed with another legal###opinion addressing the combined effects of the harsh methods , suggesting that their use in combination might be illegal . he recorded his views in e mails to chuck rosenberg , then his chief of staff , as if deliberately creating a record in case his position might become relevant to his record in the future , as it has . in one e mail to mr . rosenberg , mr . comey said he had expressed his doubts about the interrogation program at a white###house meeting with attorney###general alberto r . gonzales . in stark terms i explained to him what this would look like some day and what it would mean for the president and the government , mr . comey wrote . a case could be made , he feared , that some of this stuff was simply awful .
fears of an escalating conflict in syria rippled across financial###markets on tuesday , sinking stocks , lifting gold and pushing the price of oil to its highest in a year and a half . the increasing possibility of united###states military strikes raised worries on wall###street that energy trade in the region could be disrupted , raising fuel costs for consumers and businesses . if syria becomes drawn out and becomes a long###term issue , it 's going to show up in things like gas prices , said chris costanzo , investment officer with tanglewood wealth###management in houston . the dow###jones###industrial###average fell . 33 points , or . 1 percent , to , 776 . 13 , the lowest in two months . the standard###poor 's 500 stock###index lost . 30 points , or . 6 percent , to , 630 . 48 , and the nasdaq composite fell . 05 points , or . 2 percent , to , 578 . 52 . the law of unintended###consequences and the history of previous military###interventions in the region is not a recipe for political and economic###stability , said neil mackinnon , global macro strategist at vtb capital . the stock sell off was broad . all 10 industry sectors in the s. p . 500 index were in the red , and only 31 of the index 's 500 stocks rose . utilities and other high dividend paying stocks mostly escaped the selling . the impact was not just in stocks . gold prices advanced and government###bond prices jumped because traders see those investments as holding their value better in times of uncertainty . gold rose , or 2 percent , to , 420 an ounce . in the market for government###bonds , the price of the benchmark 10 year treasury note rose 21 32 to , and its yield declined to . 71 percent , from . 79 percent late monday . while syria itself has little oil , traders feared an intervention in syria could cause further instability in the middle###east and possibly disrupt the flow of oil from the region . oil surged . 09 , or . 9 percent , to close at . 01 a barrel , the highest closing###price since february . people worry about this becoming a worst###case###scenario and turning into a regional conflict , said bill stone , chief investment strategist at pnc asset###management . energy prices dragged down the airline###industry on concerns that higher oil###prices could lead to higher fuel costs . united###continental###holdings , the world 's largest###airline by revenue , dropped . 15 , or . 2 percent , to . 71 , and delta###air###lines lost . 16 , or . 7 percent , to . 11 . mr . stone said oil###prices could start weighing on consumer spending down the road , but it was still too early to gauge the longer###term impact . the average price for gasoline remained###unchanged at . 54 a gallon . prices have held###steady over the last week , and are down 9 cents from a month ago . in corporate news , the discount shoe seller dsw rose . 43 , or . 9 percent , to . 75 after the company reported an adjusted profit of 97 cents a share , easily###beating analysts' estimate of 80 cents a share , according to factset . and j . c . penney fell 18 cents , or . 3 percent , to . 17 after the company 's biggest investor , william a . ackman , said on monday that he planned to sell his entire stake in the chain .
washington when executives from cook medical gathered last month to offer representative cheri###bustos a tour of their central###illinois medical###equipment plant , they had good reason to expect a frosty reception from ms . bustos , a new democratic congresswoman . cook executives had backed representative bobby schilling , her republican###opponent in last year 's election for illinois 's 17th district seat , after he had joined with other house republicans to push for the repeal of a new medical###device tax imposed to pay for president###obama 's health###care law . the company said the tax would cut its profits this year by an estimated 15 million , perhaps limiting future expansions . but in a hint of a shift in corporate lobbying strategy now under way in washington , the industry pitch is now focused on democrats like ms . bustos . republican or democrat , we need them to understand who we are and what we do , said steve ferguson , the chairman of cook 's parent###company , who was there alongside ms . bustos as she toured his company plant . the visit ended with ms . bustos telling local reporters she would consider joining the effort to repeal the tax , which is expected to raise 29 billion over 10 years . if current###laws are holding businesses back from hiring locally , i 'm open to looking into ways to improve and fix them , ms . bustos said in a statement . just last year , with republicans still within reach of taking over the senate and white###house , many companies were willing to burn a chunk of their corporate lobbying budget to push house republicans to pass bills that everyone on capitol###hill knew had no chance of ever becoming law . the muscle flexing at least made a political point and potentially set up special###interest###groups , like the medical###device industry , for a successful push this year , assuming their hoped for republican victories had been scored . but then the 2012 election took place . candidates like mr . schilling were defeated , even though cook executives had contributed generously to his re election effort , to try to keep ms . bustos , a strong advocate of the obama health###care plan , out of office . now , lobbyists across the city are redoubling their efforts to build bipartisan coalitions not just on the . 3 percent medical###device excise###tax , but other hot###topics , like the possible rewriting of corporate###tax laws and revisions to the 2010 dodd###frank###act that revamped the way financial corporations are regulated . republicans still get the bulk of the money that the medical###device industry contributes . but there are some key democrats who are pulling in large###amounts of industry financial###support , like senators amy###klobuchar of minnesota and bob###casey of pennsylvania , who have been outspoken in their opposition to the medical###device tax . bipartisanship , of course , is not unheard of in washington , and the lobbyists and corporate players who have intensified their bipartisan push this year credit their dedication to good governance . but much of this is about figuring out a way to get the legislative train running again so they can deliver some rewards to their clients . lobbing grenades back and forth that is not good enough , said don###nickles , a former republican senator from oklahoma , who runs a lobbying firm whose client roster###includes medtronic , one of the nation 's top medical###device companies . it remains###unclear whether the strategy will work . the animosity between republicans and democrats on capitol###hill and between the white###house and republican leaders might be so intense that even this lobbying push will fail . but this is the moment to try , lobbyists in washington are telling their clients . the first two years of any presidential###term are when congress , at least by historical###precedent , is typically more productive before the political posturing for the next election takes over . it is no longer just about sending signals or messages , said l . f . payne jr . , a former house democrat whose lobbying firm was hired by cook medical 's parent###company last year to help its push to appeal to democrats . but it is time to actually pass some laws . the bid to repeal the medical###device tax is a prime example of this shift in lobbying tactics . last year in the senate , the industry effort was led by senator###orrin g . hatch , republican of utah , who secured the support of 33 other senators , all of them of his party . a house version pushing the tax repeal passed in june largely with republican support . but the measure died , after it failed to come to a vote in the senate . this year , mr . hatch is again sponsoring a repeal bill , but he has four democrats as co sponsors , including liberals like senator al###franken of minnesota . perhaps even more important , industry lobbyists helped circulate a letter among senate democrats in december , after the election , criticizing the tax and urging a delay in its jan . 1 establishment . sixteen sitting democratic###senators and two who had just been elected ultimately signed on . it was a real coup for the industry , as the letter included top senate democrats like richard j . durbin of illinois and charles e . schumer of new york . the behind the scenes story of how those signatures were secured offers a window into the changing lobbying tactics . companies like cook medical have seen their lobbying budgets soar , as they have beefed up their representation by lobbying firms with democratic credentials , like the firm where mr . payne works , mcguire woods , which also has former senator evan###bayh , democrat of indiana , as a lawyer on its team . the appeal has included dozens of telephone calls from executives at medical###device companies to the senate democrats or their staff , as well as many meetings in person on capitol###hill . trade###associations like the advanced###medical technology association , have organized rallylike events in different states , and fly ins to washington , in which employees of medical###equipment firms make it clear that they expect the help of their local members of congress . donations from industry executives to certain important democratic allies , like ms . klobuchar of minnesota and mr . casey of pennsylvania , surged in the last election cycle as the industry played a significant###role in their re election efforts . ms . klobuchar , whose state has an estimated 400 medical###device companies employing about , 000 people , has emerged as one of the industry 's most important allies cornering other democrats on the senate floor to press them to join the push , industry lobbyists said . the first real test will come this week . senate backers of the device tax repeal , like mr . hatch and ms . klobuchar , plan to propose a nonbinding amendment to a federal###budget bill to make their bipartisan opposition to the tax clear . the industry executives and the lawmakers involved have at least so far avoided identifying how they would pay for the repeal of the device tax . they realize that they would only draw opposition from lobbyists representing whatever industry it is that would be targeted to make up the money . the biggest###obstacle remains the white###house , which last year threatened to veto the house medical tax repeal bill . the white###house argues that demand for new devices will offset the economic###impact of the tax . but the industry , which sells devices ranging from wooden tongue depressors to pacemakers , has important democratic allies now trying to squeeze the white###house as well . ms . klobuchar and mr . franken brought up the topic last month with mr . obama during a ride they took with him on air###force one . i think that there has been some renewed understanding on the president 's part , mr . franken told the editorial###board of a minnesota newspaper last month which then repeated his call for the repeal of the tax , under a headline , if a tax has bipartisan opposition , obama should listen .
boston he was a ranger for only two disappointing###seasons , and that was three years and three teams ago . one of those teams was in the american###hockey###league . wade###redden , an injured boston###bruins defenseman , has yet to play against the rangers in the teams' eastern###conference semifinal###series , but he will be at madison###square###garden for game 3 tuesday###night . he is not sure of his status . but he is pretty certain what the garden fans will have to say if they catch a glimpse of no . 6 on the ice for the hated bruins . it wo n't be a warm###reception , let 's just put it that way , redden said monday before the bruins departed for new york . i 'm not going to worry about it . based on his return on investment in new york , redden has every reason to expect to hear jeers , a lot of them . he signed a six year deal with the rangers in 2008 for 39 million , but he played in new york in only 2008 9 and . he played for the rangers' a.h.l . affiliate in hartford in 2010 11 and , and then the parent###club bought out the final two years of the deal and waived him in january after the lockout . st . louis signed him later that month , and he appeared in 23 games for the blues . the bruins acquired him in april from the blues for a sixth###round###draft###pick in . he has yet to play a game against the rangers since leaving new york . redden , who played four seasons in ottawa with the bruins captain zdeno chara , appeared in six regular###season###games for boston . he was a regular on defense in the bruins' first round series against toronto before being hurt in game 5 of the series . neither redden nor the team has disclosed the nature of the injury . redden worked out with the bruins on saturday before game . on monday , he was joined by defenseman dennis###seidenberg , which constituted unqualified good news for the bruins and coach claude julien . seidenberg has not played since injuring himself early in game 7 against the maple###leafs . seidenberg was not available to reporters monday , but redden , 35 , talked about possibly returning tuesday###night . he said that he was day to day and that he was close to returning . my only thought and goal , he said , is to get healthy and go from there . they know what everyone can do . it 'll be up to the coaches . but i 've been able to do more and more each day . that 's a positive . i ca n't say right now if i 'll be able to play . we 'll talk tomorrow . julien would not say whether redden or seidenberg would be available for game . he said that both players were getting close and that he would meet with them and the medical###staff before the game . the prospect of redden or seidenberg returning could make things a bit complicated for the bruins' coach , given the strong play of the rookies who replaced them torey krug and matt bartkowski . krug has scored a goal in each of the two games his first two n.h.l . playoff###games and bartkowski had a goal in game 7 against the maple###leafs . they 've been solid , redden said of the rookies . and that 's great . they 've done a great job , and let 's hope they keep doing that . julien was predictably diplomatic when asked about the potential difficulty of replacing the rookies . krug has averaged nearly 15 minutes a game paired with adam###mcquaid . bartkowski , paired with johnny###boychuk , has averaged nearly 20 minutes a game in the playoffs . the best thing to do , julien said of the potential###problem , is to cross that bridge when you get to it . he said worrying about it now would be a lot of wasted time . julien added when the time comes , i 'll be ready to make that decision . that 's what they want me to do as a coach , and that 's what i keep doing whether it 's right or wrong . the third injured boston defenseman , andrew###ference , did not practice monday . he was injured in game 4 of the toronto series with what the boston###globe described as a lower###body###injury . ... coach claude julien on what he expected from the rangers in game does n't matter . i think it 's what we expect from ourselves . we always worry about the other team . we need to worry about ourselves .
melbourne , australia a year ago , at their annual meeting in melbourne , the leading men 's tennis players were angrily discussing the possibility of boycotting the australian###open . at this year 's meeting , craig tiley , the tournament director , and steve wood , tennis###australia 's chief###executive , received a standing###ovation . that was a###level of appreciation i 've never seen before from the players toward a grand###slam , said justin###gimelstob , a player representative on the atp 's board of directors . you can argue the how and why , but right now , as of this date , this is the only place where the players feel like they are truly heard . melbourne###park , the site of the australian###open since , is in the midst of its latest growth###spurt . it will soon have a third stadium with a retractable###roof . wimbledon has one , and the united###states open and the french###open have none . chris###evert , a two time australian###open champion who reached the final in , returned for the first time last year . i was kind of blown away , she said of the site 's transformation . a new national###tennis###center with eight indoor###hard###courts , five outdoor###hard###courts and eight red clay###courts opened last year at the eastern###edge of melbourne###park . it features plunge pools for recovery , an extensive weight###room and fitness area and , this week , a number of positive user reviews . this is the best facility of its kind at any of the grand###slams , nicolas###mahut , a french player , said tuesday . the australian###open is first . wimbledon is second and then the rest . the australians , unlike expansion minded united###states open officials , have the advantage of full public###financing . the local victorian government has committed 386 million to this initial redevelopment###project with more work in the planning###phase , all of which underscores the fact that the australian###open , once by far the least prestigious grand###slam###tournament , continues to gain prestige and clout . its officials also have been the most openly supportive of the men 's players' demands for a greater percentage of grand###slam revenue and more input in decision###making . after consultation with the tours , the tournament has committed much of its 2013 increase in prize###money to the early round###losers . i said to the players at the meeting 'why are we doing this ? why are we being aggressive with prize###money ? ' tiley said . and i said 'i 'm looking at you all in the eye right now . it 's because of your careers . some of you in this room are making a good living , and a lot of you in this room and every one of you who is not in this room are not making a living . ' so i said , 'we will make a promise to you that we will do our part in changing that . ' the australian###open increased its prize###money by 4 million for this year 's event , and the united###states open announced last month that it also would increase total###prize###money by 4 million for . the french###open and wimbledon have yet to announce their purses . but while the players applauded the australian###open 's leadership , many remain dissatisfied with the united###states open 's announced###plans in part because they were packaged with a 15th day of play in the form of a monday men 's final . the united###states open has finished on a monday the past five years because of rain , but several leading###players , above all roger###federer , had made it clear that they were against an official monday finish . even without the monday final , it still would have been disappointing , that amount of money , gimelstob said . united###states open officials argue that their approach is generous and temporary . gordon###smith , the united###states###tennis###association executive###director , said by telephone that the tournament found itself in a financial predicament this year . the tournament was committed to scheduling a day of rest between the men 's semifinals and final . to do so , it needed not only to alter its long established schedule but to renegotiate its existing agreement with cbs , which runs through . according to smith , the cost to the tournament in 2013 for switching the men 's semifinals to friday and keeping the final in its sunday slot would have been about 10 million , while the cost of keeping the men 's semifinals on saturday and scheduling the final on monday was considerably less , at . 5 million . switching the semifinals to friday would have required a loss of two ticketed sessions .

east###rutherford , n.j . several rows of long tables were arranged around the basketball court , each covered by a black###cloth with a white sheet of paper bearing one word , reserved . decision###makers for the 30 n.b.a . teams chose their seats . on one end of the court sat danny###ainge , the boston###celtics' president for basketball operations . daryl morey , his counterpart with the houston###rockets , sat close to midcourt . john###hollinger , the vice###president for basketball operations with the memphis###grizzlies , took a table farthest from the court . they said little and jotted down notes . inside the nets' practice facility last wednesday and thursday , more than 50 executives and scouts evaluated 44 players who hope to be selected in next month 's n.b.a . draft . yet none of the athletes who participated are expected to be lottery picks . or even first round###picks . a week earlier in chicago , players projected to be taken in the first round worked out at a far more glamorous event , one covered live by espn and nba###tv . there were no television cameras here to document that every team was represented , aiming to find a second round###draft###pick who can contribute as a reserve or even as a starter someday . we do the novel idea of 5 on 5 here , morey wrote on twitter last wednesday . the new jersey combine was the only time before the draft when players participated in five on five full court scrimmages . that is the old school way and perhaps still one of the best approaches to judge a player 's talent and potential . in the past decade , teams have found valuable players after the 30th overall pick . at no . 35 last year , golden###state selected draymond###green , who played significant minutes as the warriors reached the second round of the playoffs for the first time since . with the 34th pick in , the cleveland###cavaliers selected carlos###boozer , an accomplished n.b.a . veteran who is now an important part of the chicago###bulls . luis###scola ( no . 55 , 2002 ) , paul###millsap ( no . 47 , 2006 ) and monta###ellis ( no . 40 , 2005 ) eventually became starters . memphis 's marc###gasol ( no . 48 , 2007 ) was named defensive###player of the year this season . recent###history suggests that at least one of the 44 players trying to make an impression last week will succeed in the n.b.a . there 's always a few , of course , said gregg polinsky , director for player###personnel for the nets . he added usually when the draft is top heavy and then it drifts in the first round , it naturally pushes guys down . and that 's when you generally have your better second round drafts . the players took part in strength testing and individual drills . two of the most intriguing prospects were peyton###siva and a . j . matthews . as a senior , siva averaged 10 points and . 7 assists and led louisville to the national###championship . matthews , a 6 foot , 215 pound center from division###iii farmingdale state on long###island , led the nation with . 3 rebounds a game . he also averaged . 4 points as a junior this past season . although they were successful in college , it is unclear whether siva and matthews will hear their names called during the june 27 draft . many scouts and executives are worried about siva 's height ( 5 11 without shoes ) because most point###guards in the n.b.a . are taller and stronger . siva , however , has been praised for his intangibles and his leadership . his supporters say louisville always succeeded with him . some mock###drafts list siva as a second round###selection . others project that he will not be drafted . i just want to show teams i 'm a capable###leader and that i can continue to run teams and find open people and get them open shots , siva said . a lot of people always say , 'why did n't you score a lot in college and why did n't you up those big###numbers ? ' for me , it was n't my job to do that . i 'm all about winning . most teams had not seen matthews play in person until last week . but his size and athleticism have made it hard for them to ignore him . in individual drills , there is no defense , said matthews , who grew up in brooklyn . you 're either making jumps shots or missing them . when you play five on five and you 're running up and down , it shows your stamina , your speed against other big###men and your jumping ability . this gave me a lot of confidence to show i can play with these guys . the nets do not have a second round###pick this year , but polinsky said siva and matthews had a chance to become reliable n.b.a . players . i thought that he was impressive , polinsky said of matthews . i thought he did a nice job . he 's a big , long guy who has not played at a division i level but showed that he is capable of doing so . i think that will earn him some workouts and some looks . polinsky said of siva real competitive , great###speed . what do you say ? winning culture , been coached and can take all you can give him . he 's going to get some looks . some teams spent time interviewing players after the scrimmages to inform their second round strategy . siva and matthews , along with the other 42 players , have five weeks to prove they should not be overlooked . of course you want to be a first###round###draft###pick , siva said , but getting drafted is getting drafted .
reminders of the glory###days of fordham football are everywhere . the famed seven blocks of granite are honored with a monument erected in . vince###lombardi , a guard on that unit and later a renowned coach , will forever be celebrated as a towering figure in the university 's history . one does not expect a return of the golden###years of the 1930s , when fordham defeated national powers before capacity###crowds at yankee###stadium and at the polo###grounds . but none of that is keeping this from being a special time as the rams earned their program record 12th victory on saturday , 37 27 against sacred###heart , in the first football###championship###subdivision playoff###game at jack coffey field in the bronx . the sweetness of the moment was not lost on joe moorhead , the rams' second year coach . he inherited a 1 10 program and oversaw a 6 5 turnaround that built momentum for this year 's 12 1 breakthrough entering next saturday 's game at towson in the round of . it seems like every week this season we 've remarked that this is our best win or this is something that has n't been done in fordham football history , moorhead said . that was correct on two more counts today this is the first time we 've had 12 wins , and this is the first time we 've had an f.c.s . win at home . it 's a credit to these young###men , to their dedication and their persistence on a weekly###basis to do what is necessary to win football games . the rams set program records for points ( 460 ) and total###yards , 252 ) this season . they continued to roll in their first postseason appearance since , outgaining potent sacred###heart in yards , 539 414 , and converting four turnovers into 20 points . mark nofri , who guided the pioneers to a 10 3 record and their first f.c.s . postseason###game in his first full season , noted that his team had a plus 22 turnover differential as the northeast###conference champion . we 've been on the plus side of the turnover battle all year , nofri said . that 's how we won games . when we lost , we were on the minus side . keshaudas spence , a bullish 230 pound running back for sacred###heart , carried 25 times for 197 yards and typically required a swarm of tacklers to bring him down . he could not look past his two fumbles , though . we definitely could have pulled away with a win , spence said . we shot ourselves in the foot . opponents have little margin for error when opposing michael nebrich , a junior quarterback who transferred to fordham from connecticut when moorhead left as the huskies' offensive###coordinator to take over as coach of the rams . nebrich converted 32 of 51 passes for 413 yards . his three touchdown passes all came as fordham built a 31 17 halftime advantage . he also rushed for 38 yards . fordham 's offense cannot be stopped , he said , when it executes at a high###level . we 've###shown it and proved it , nebrich said . we 're not going to fear any defense we face , especially towson . fordham used its rapid fire attack to run 48 plays for 348 yards in the opening half . nebrich looked machinelike at times in completing 22 of 32 attempts for 306 yards in the half . he was intercepted when a first quarter screen###pass slipped out of his gloved###hand for fordham 's lone turnover , which proved harmless . nebrich connected with tebucky jones jr . , son of a former n.f.l . safety , for a 32 yard###catch and run that put fordham ahead , 10 7 , with 6 minutes 23 seconds###left in the opening quarter . he kept his hot hand with a pair of second quarter touchdown throws a 19 yard strike to sam ajalana , a junior wide###receiver , and a 3 yard toss to carlton koonce , a senior running back . the touchdowns from jones and ajalana allowed the rams to capitalize on the fumbles by spence . ajalana created fordham 's largest advantage , 24 7 , when he reached the end###zone at 38 of the second quarter . ajalana , a junior , finished with seven receptions and led all receivers with 128 yards . the rams converted all five of their chances in the red###zone . it means everything , koonce said of a playoff###victory that seemed unthinkable only a couple of years###ago . as a senior , you never want it to end . we 'll battle for another week and look forward to towson .
los###angeles rookie sensation yasiel###puig singled home the tying and go ahead runs in the seventh###inning , andre###ethier had a two run double , and the los###angeles###dodgers opened a four game series against the philadelphia###phillies with a 6 4 victory on thursday###night . greinke ( 4 3 ) struck out five over seven innings and allowed four runs on 12 hits , including solo homers by domonic###brown and chase###utley , to help the dodgers get their sixth###straight win . the right hander came out for a pinch###hitter in the seventh after giving up utley 's tiebreaking homer in the top of the inning . puig was shaken up crashing into the right field auxiliary scoreboard while trying to track utley 's ninth homer in the top of the seventh that put philadelphia ahead . however , puig was none the worse for wear as he would prove moments later . the dodgers loaded the bases in the bottom half against rookie reliever justin de fratus ( 2 2 ) without the benefit of a hit . a.j . ellis walked and juan###uribe reached on a bunt that first baseman ryan###howard tried to field before slipping and falling on the play . nick###punto advanced the runners with another bunt , and hanley ramirez drew an intentional###walk while batting for greinke . skip###schumaker was called out on strikes for the second time , but puig slapped an 0 2 pitch to left###field to put the dodgers ahead . the cuban wunderkind is batting a robust . 427 with seven homers and 16 rbis in just 23 big###league games . matt###kemp , playing in his third game after missing a month with an injured right hamstring , was 2 for 4 with an rbi double . he led off the eighth with a single , then stole second and third base and scored on ellis' sacrifice###fly . kenley###jansen followed j.p . howell and ronald belisario out of the bullpen and got the last three outs for his seventh save in nine chances . phillies rookie jonathan pettibone threw 96 pitches through six innings and was lifted for a pinch###hitter after giving up three runs and four hits . the right hander retired his final 15 batters , a stretch that began with a sacrifice###bunt by greinke after a leadoff###single and stolen###base by punto in the second inning . pettibone found himself trailing 3 0 after just 17 pitches . kemp hit an rbi double inside third base , and two more runs came in on ethier 's double off the fence in right center . right fielder delmon###young prevented another run , sprinting toward the corner and stretching out to grab ellis' extra base bid . young tied a career###high with four hits all singles and put himself within seven of , 000 for his career . brown , in his first career at bat against greinke , put philadelphia on the board in the second when he drove a 3 2 pitch to center for his 21 st homer and tied colorado 's carlos gonzalez for the nl lead . greinke then gave up a single to young and a walk to kevin frandsen before picking off young at second base . the phillies tied it 3 all in the fifth with four consecutive one out hits , including run###scoring singles by utley and jimmy###rollins only his second rbi in 10 games . greinke , who has n't committed an error in his last 87 starts , minimized the damage by turning ryan###howard 's comebacker into an inning ending double###play after a visit from pitching coach rick###honeycutt . notes former phillies c darren###daulton , who played for their 1983 nl championship team and spent the majority of his 15 big###league seasons with them , was diagnosed with two brain###tumors and will undergo surgery next week . the announcement was made thursday in a statement by the radio###station in philadelphia that has broadcasted his program , talking baseball with dutch , for the past four years . ... two days after ucla captured its first college###baseball world###series title , most of the players from the team were introduced one by one along the first base###line just before the start of the game . at the end of the line were two former bruins who played for the dodgers tim leary and todd###zeile , whose son###shane is a catcher of the current squad . ... utley , who also played for ucla , has six home###runs and a . 320 average in 31 career games at dodger###stadium . he was 3 for 5 thursday . ... frandsen started at 3b for the third time this season in place of michael###young , who did n't start after playing in 21 consecutive###games and starting in 20 of them . ... kemp is 9 for 9 on stolen###base attempts .
boston as mariano###rivera walked off the field in baltimore on thursday###night , thinking he had just secured another save for the yankees , he heard the public###address###announcer call him the winning###pitcher . i thought it was a mistake , he said . i just thought they made a mistake and said i got the win when i really had a save . in fact , mark jacobson , the official###scorer at camden###yards , had invoked rule . 17 ( c , which allows him to take the win away from an ineffective pitcher in this case , dave###robertson and give it to a different pitcher . but since a pitcher cannot collect a win and a save , rivera was given the win and not given credit for the save . that left him at 43 saves , tied with jim###johnson , the orioles' closer , for most in the american###league . it 's weird , rivera said . i do n't really understand it , but we won , so that 's what counts . with the yankees leading by 5 2 in the top of the eighth , robertson surrendered a three run homer to danny###valencia . j . j . hardy then hit a double to get into scoring###position , but robertson struck out matt###wieters to end the inning with the score tied , 5 5 . the yankees went ahead with a run in the top of the ninth , and rivera pitched a 1 2 3 bottom of the ninth to secure the victory . in that circumstance , rivera typically would have earned a save . wins are not a relevant statistic for relief###pitchers saves are their measuring stick . rivera was not overly consumed with the matter , but found it curious , since it related directly to his job , and said he might ask someone about the specifics of the rule to gain a better understanding . i 'd like to see him get a save , yankees manager joe###girardi said of rivera , but when i woke up this morning , it did n't###change my life .
lakeland , fla . despite looking uneven during his second game facing major###league hitters since being shut down last summer , dillon###gee said he felt that he was near his optimal form for the start of the season . i do n't know if it 's just my sixth###sense , but i feel###pretty close , said gee , who pitched four innings and gave up one hit , one run and three walks during the mets' 3 2 loss to the detroit###tigers on friday###afternoon . he added , i 've been doing this long enough to know that i 'm on the right track , and i can feel that i 'm really close to figuring it out right now . gee had surgery last summer to remove a blood###clot from his arm , a procedure that sidelined him for the second half of the season . he recovered and has said he has felt normal since the fall . earlier in the exhibition season , gee pitched three scoreless###innings against the miami###marlins . before that , he pitched during an exhibition###game against the university of michigan . his main task has been to regain a feel for all of his pitches . he said he was still leaving some fastballs high in the strike###zone , but he was happy with his secondary pitches friday . unfortunately , he could n't locate some of his fastballs , but he kept his composure and executed pitches when he needed to and got some pitcher 's best friend double plays , said catcher travis###d'arnaud , who left the game after getting hit by a pitch on his right forearm in the fifth inning . d'arnaud said his arm felt stiff but was otherwise fine . with the loss , the mets dropped to 3 6 in grapefruit league play . they continue to have questions about several areas of their roster , but manager terry###collins was brief when asked about how some positional battles were proceeding . in response to more than one question , he said , it 's march .
does there really need to be another awards show ? spike###jonze recently wondered aloud . if there 's going to be one , why ? this was a reasonable sentiment that mr . jonze , the veteran director of music###videos and feature###films , happened to verbalize as he was overseeing a new music###awards show . relaxing in an upstairs office at steiner studios in brooklyn , mr . jonze was taking a break on tuesday###afternoon from his duties as the creative###director of the youtube###music###awards , an online celebration of pop###music and performers that will debut on sunday . when the curtain rises on this awards show , which will be held at pier 36 in manhattan and shown on the youtube website , it will be the latest entry in a field of congratulatory broadcasts already dominated by the grammy###awards , the mtv###video###music###awards , the billboard###music###awards and the american###music###awards , among many others . but if done correctly or even not so correctly the event presents other substantial opportunities for youtube and its corporate###parent , google a chance to show that they can create the kind of content that was once broadcast television 's exclusive domain and that produces the unexpected , you had to be there viral moments that online audiences thrive on . it 's an important time for us to celebrate what youtube 's role is in the music ecosystem , said danielle tiedt , the website 's vice###president for marketing . i think youtube stands at a really interesting place , she added , where it not only is the water###cooler , where the conversation happens and propagates , but certainly can be part of making the moments that lead to those conversations . one floor below mr . jonze 's office , a , 600 square###foot soundstage had been overrun by artists and crew preparing feverishly but harmoniously for a live event that they had never attempted and whose commencement was five days away . along the studio 's perimeter , directors like james larese , chris###milk and ray tintori and the french graffiti###artist fafi were clustered around laptops , reviewing plans for performances by eminem , avicii and m.i.a . in one corner , an enthusiastic choreographer was leading a squad of young###dancers through a routine that will accompany an arcade fire number . in another corner , members of the band ok go were conferring with jason###schwartzman , the actor and a co host of the awards show , figuring out how to paint his face and clothing to blend in with a picture of a mythical beast projected on the wall . for mr . jonze , there was not much time for philosophical deliberations on why the youtube###music###awards should exist he and his collaborators were sufficiently happy to have a star###studded lineup of artists and a 90 minute canvas to do with as they wished . we 've been given a lot of room to make a mess , mr . jonze said . hopefully , it 'll be a fun mess . mr . jonze said he was approached about six months###ago to take charge of the youtube show , which will give out awards in six categories , like artist of the year and response of the year , with winners chosen by online###vote . ( the event is also being produced by vice###media and sunset lane entertainment . ) over the last month , as mr . jonze finished his new movie , her , and presented it at the new york film###festival , he became entrenched in his work on the awards show . he helped###recruit its hosts , mr . schwartzman and reggie###watts , the musician and comedian , as well as directors like mr . milk , who came to new york a month ago for a conference on the future of storytelling not necessarily to help out mr . jonze . the whole thing is like a game of pickup basketball , mr . jonze explained . whoever 's nearby is playing . mr . milk said the goal of each artist 's performance was to create an original music###video in a live setting . it will never be as polished as a regular music###video , he said , but it will have all the spontaneity and humanity of a live performance . in theory . some of these videos , mr . milk said , are more narrative , story based . some , he continued , are more just about focusing on one performance . we have a video where mr . jonze interrupted him and indicated the reporter in the room . do n't tell him any of the ideas , he said . mr . schwartzman said that he and mr . watts had been deliberately but willingly excluded from writing###sessions so that their dialogue during the show would not sound programmed . spike was like , 'why do n't we just not have scripts ? ' mr . schwartzman said . that sounded kind of fun . then it became , why do n't you throw stuff at us that we do n't know is coming , to keep it spontaneous ? as a tight , protective cap was being fitted around his head and chin , mr . schwartzman was asked if he was comfortable with knowing so few details about the show . do i look like a guy who 's not cool with it ? he answered . youtube 's rivals in the awards show arena seemed to welcome the competition , though some cautioned that the site would face###challenges as a web only content company . if you 're asking , 'how do we compete with a tv show , or how do we do a tv like show ? , ' then you 're not really creating something endemic to a medium , said dermot mccormack , an mtv###networks executive who is the head of connected content for the viacom music and logo group . mr . mccormack pointed to mtv 's own efforts with a digital event called the o music###awards , which emphasizes stunts like a 24 hour drumming marathon performed by the rock musician andrew w . k . we were afforded that luxury , mr . mccormack said , because we already have that great show called the vmas that drives pop###culture and creates moments . bill werde , the editorial###director of billboard , said that there 's always room for more good entertainment , whether on television or online , and that a viewership could be drawn to an awards show that rejoices in the unexpected and the spontaneously weird . there 's a great###hunger , by youtube and other online###platforms , for the sort of moments created by an awards show , mr . werde said . people want to see a more honest slice of their favorite celebrities . the way to get closest to that is to take away some of the safety###nets . ms . tiedt of youtube declined to say how much the company was spending on the awards show . ( it certainly is not free , she said . ) the success of the event , she added , would not be measured by its immediate viewership , but in weeks' worth of online views and comments and other signs that youtube is becoming increasingly integral to music fans . we 're looking for a long###term brand perception and a long###term belief , ms . tiedt said . that does n't need to happen in the moment . mr . jonze said his creative decisions were not influenced by corporate pronouncements but more out of not wanting to be boring than any prerequired thing . whatever the show turns out to be , he said , it 's so awesomely not broadcast television . adding three words that seem to forgive so much , he said , it 's the internet .
last season , rangers goalie henrik###lundqvist was one of the first professional###athletes to participate in the you can play campaign , promoting respect for all athletes without regard to sexual###orientation . that was why some were surprised when lundqvist , in stockholm earlier this month to prepare for the sochi olympics , declined to comment on a new law in russia that has been criticized in the west as antigay . when it comes to the olympics , i think you should just focus on the sport , lundqvist said in stockholm . his subdued remarks drew###criticism , in part because two of his swedish teammates , henrik###zetterberg and victor###hedman , spoke out strongly against the law . but on sunday , lundqvist clarified his stance . of course i do n't###agree with the laws they have there , lundqvist said before a charity event in brooklyn . i think everybody should have the same rights it does n't matter who you are . however , he also maintained that the olympics should be kept separate from politics . when it comes to the olympics , i agree with a lot of people that it really should n't be a political place , lundqvist said . when i think back at the countries that have hosted the olympics , they all had some serious issues . if every time you have to comment on each country 's issues , it 's going to be more about the politics than the sport . lundqvist 's nuanced position demonstrates the difficult path athletes and coaches must negotiate as the outcry grows over the law , which bans propaganda on nontraditional sexual###relationships . last week , brian###burke , part of usa###hockey 's olympic management team , rejected###calls for a boycott of the sochi games in february because , he said , it would hurt the athletes . but he also suggested that participants pack a rainbow pen and give interviews in sochi saying you 're pro gay and that you support the l.g.b.t . community . burke 's son brendan , who died in a car###accident in , came out a year earlier and had burke 's full support . burke 's son###patrick founded and directs you can play . lundqvist 's remarks in stockholm were made at the swedish olympic team 's orientation camp , which he said he thought was an inappropriate place to discuss the law . i did n't really want to comment on it when i was there to represent sweden at the olympics , he said . lundqvist , at aviator sports center for a two day hockey clinic to benefit his new children 's foundation , is going into the final year of his contract with the rangers . he said contract talks with the rangers were volatile , but that there 's no pressure to get it done this summer .
expect your friends and relatives to misdial your phone###number . be prepared to explain when other manhattan dwellers ask if you live in another city or another state . beginning tomorrow , customers who sign up for new phone###service in manhattan may be assigned the new 646 area###code , instead of the venerable 212 prefix that has become as synonymous with life in the city as broadway shows , central###park and the hudson###river . the transition is not likely to be easy . for some , it will be an annoying inconvenience . callers could end up dialing 11 numbers 1 plus the area###code plus the phone###number to reach someone right down the street . ( customers making calls within the same area###code will continue to dial only seven . ) but for many others , the change will strike more of a blow at vanity . ''two one two has a cachet , '' said nan kim , 30 , a graduate###student who is taking###classes this summer at columbia###university . ''you feel like it 's new york , as trivial as that sounds . it 's sort of an icon of new york to have the 212 area###code , like broadway or yellow cabs . '' for others , the emotional blow will be reminiscent of that suffered by residents in three other boroughs 14 years###ago , when they lost the 212 area###code and , some argued , their sense of connection to the city as a whole to 718 . ( the bronx got 718 in 1992 . ) ''it 's selfish , but i do n't want to always explain that yes , i do indeed live and work here , '' said tommy michels , 40 , a salesman who plans to add a phone###line for his home###office on the upper west side . phone###numbers now in the 212 area###code will remain###unchanged , since the 646 code will be assigned only to new telephone connections and will be used throughout manhattan . the new york state public###service###commission , which approved the new area###code in november 1997 , decided against a plan that would have divided manhattan geographically into 212 and 646 zones . the 646 area###code is another effort by state officials to accommodate the growing###demand for telecommunication services that has led to a proliferation of connections for home and business phones , computer modems , fax machines , pagers and cellular###phones . local phone###companies there are about 20 in new york###city alone have also grabbed up available phone###numbers in the increasingly fierce###competition to provide local###service to new customers . in 1992 , the 917 area###code was introduced specifically for cellular###phones and pagers in the five boroughs , but it was extended last year to cover some residences and businesses in manhattan as well . the 917 area###code at the two star restaurant in harlem has confused some customers who still associate those numbers with their cellular###phones and pagers , said the restaurant manager , charles singh . ''they feel funny , '' he said . ''people around the neighborhood say , 'why do i have to dial it ? ' '' that is a question likely to be heard more often as phone###companies strive to keep up with the communications boom . by the end of the year , five area###codes will cover the city , including the new 347 prefix that will go into service on oct . 1 in brooklyn , queens , the bronx and staten###island . new area###codes are also being added in southern new jersey ( 856 ) and suffolk###county on long###island ( 631 ) . each area###code can have a maximum of 7.9 million phone###numbers , although it is unusual for every one to be assigned , said rebecca barnhart , a spokeswoman for the information services branch of the lockheed###martin###corporation , which assigns area###codes for north###america . she said that nearly all the phone###numbers in the 212 area###code had been distributed to phone###companies , and that the 917 area###code was not far behind . dave flanagan , a spokesman for the public###service###commission , said the 646 area###code should insure that there will be enough new phone###numbers available in manhattan for the next six years . ms . barnhart said the 212 area###code was established for new york in 1947 , when the 10 digit###number used in the modern phone system was created . the original 86 area###codes have since grown to 218 active area###codes , with more that have been assigned , ms . barnhart said . other sprawling metropolitan###areas have also introduced multiple area###codes to meet the demand . the los###angeles region has eight different area###codes while the chicago###area has five , and the boston###area has four . for those manhattanites opposed to any area###code other than 212 , there is still hope . manhattan customers will be randomly assigned a phone###number with the 212 , 646 or 917 area###code depending on what is available for their particular location , said john bonomo , a spokesman for bell###atlantic , the largest phone service###provider in new york . mr . bonomo said his company would try to honor requests for a 212 phone###number whenever possible . ''people move and businesses close , so the bank of telephone numbers is usually fluid , '' mr . bonomo said . ''in 20 years , someone will still get a 212 phone###number . ''
bayonne , n.j . the most expensive hospital in america is not set###amid the swaying palm trees of beverly###hills or the luxury townhouses of new york 's upper east side . it is in a faded blue###collar town 11 miles from midtown###manhattan . based on the bills it submits to medicare , the bayonne medical center charged the highest amounts in the country for nearly one quarter of the most common hospital treatments , according to a new york times analysis of 2011 data , the most recent available . no other hospital was at the top of the price list more often . bayonne medical typically charged , 689 for treating each case of chronic###lung###disease , 5.5 times as much as other hospitals and . 5 times as much as medicare paid in reimbursement . the hospital also charged on average of , 040 to treat transient ischemia , a type of small stroke that has no lasting###effect . that was . 6 times the national###average and . 6 times what medicare paid . for those prices , the quality of care at bayonne medical is no better or worse than that at most other new jersey hospitals . in a 2011 state hospital quality report , bayonne medical scored only in the top 50 percent . but profits at the hospital , which was bankrupt in , have soared in recent###years , in part because it has found a way to turn some of those high billings into payments . the increasingly contentious issue of hospital charges drew renewed###attention last week when the federal###government released medicare data showing that facilities nationwide submitted widely###divergent bills for the same treatments . and while the unassuming , six story brick hospital here holds a notable place in those rankings , others stand out as well . the midsize crozer chester medical center in upland , pa . , was the top biller in the country for urinary###tract###infections . oneprestigious manhattan hospital , nyu###langone###medical###center , charged twice as much as the equally high###end newyork###presbyterian to implant a cardiac###pacemaker . but medicare considers the two new york hospitals so similar it pays them both about , 000 for the procedure . the hospital industry is quick to say that the charges are irrelevant because virtually no one private insurers , medicare or even the uninsured pays anywhere near those amounts . medicare sets standard rates for treatments and insurers negotiate with hospitals . but experts add that the charges reflect decades of maneuvering by hospitals to gain an edge over insurers and provide themselves with tax advantages . until a recent ruling by the internal###revenue###service , for instance , a hospital could use the higher###prices when calculating the amount of charity care it was providing , said gerard anderson , director of the center for hospital finance and management at johns###hopkins . there is a method to the madness , though it is still madness , mr . anderson said . a close look at the finances of bayonne medical center sheds light on how hospital pricing at the extremes may financially benefit an institution . the practices at bayonne medical also highlight a new financial strategy used by a small number of hospitals to increase their profits by going out of network severing###ties , and hence contractual agreements that limit reimbursement rates , with large private insurers . neither officials nor owners of bayonne medical responded to multiple calls and e mail requests for interviews . because the company is privately###held , it does not have to release financial###data . bayonne medical , which was founded in , was losing nearly . 5 million a month before it filed###for###bankruptcy in . by , under new ownership and a new financial###model , its patient revenue had nearly tripled and its operating###income had reached . 3 million , according to the american hospital directory , a publication that compiles data from medicare and other sources about health###care facilities . the hospital 's turnabout started in 2008 when it was acquired out of bankruptcy by a consortium of buyers in a deal###valued at about 41 million . bayonne 's purchasers included vivek garipalli , who worked at the private###equity giant blackstone###group before co founding the international sleep network , a company based in new jersey that treats###patients with sleep###apnea and other disorders . joining mr . garipalli was jeffrey mandler , the head of a health###care imaging firm . to make money from bayonne medical , the new buyers made some big changes in the hospital 's business###strategy .
madison keys has begun her career with a bang , in large part because she begins points with a bang . keys , ranked 40th at age , is the youngest###player in the top , and is already near the top of many statistical###categories involving serving . she averages . 6 aces per match , third best on the wta###tour , behind no . 1 serena###williams and the wimbledon finalist sabine###lisicki , who each average just over . keys also wins the third highest###percentage of her service games ( 74 percent , behind williams and maria###sharapova . while other players like serena###williams , venus###williams , samantha###stosur and lisicki have built their games around their serves , keys has an assertiveness from the first shot of the rally that stands out on the tour . when i have a nice rhythm going , and i have my toss in the right spot , when everything is kind of working how it 's supposed to be , i think it 's just really easy , you know , and i do n't have to overthink on it , keys said . because of a ball toss that floats higher than those used by most other big servers , timing is especially important for keys . and timing starts with her legs . it 's going up when your toss is at its highest###point , she said . using your legs explosively , but using them explosively at the right time , and timing it correctly . then accelerating with your racket head and snapping your wrist as the ball is coming down . then it 's not leaning###forward too far , or else you 're going to hit the net . there 's so many things going on . to help simplify her serve , keys has removed one moving element her back leg . instead of pulling it forward to the baseline as she makes###contact with the ball , keys switched to a platform stance similar to the one used by roger###federer , in which the feet are kept apart . keys 's coach , juan todero , called his charge 's serve one of the best serves on tour right now . shoulder tendinitis led keys to withdraw from the united###states open warm up tournaments in toronto and suburban cincinnati this summer , but todero said the injury had subsided with rest . keys has played more matches this year than ever before in her first year unencumbered by the wta 's age rules . keys reached the third round of the australian###open and wimbledon and advanced to the second round of the french###open . but she faces a difficult first round###match at the united###states open against ninth###seeded jelena jankovic . keys acknowledged that her serve was pretty###bad when she first took up the sport as a child . i had , like , the pancake grip , she said with a laugh . and just , i doinked it over the net . keys said her serve first developed into a strength of her game when she was 9 and moved from rock###island , ill . , to the chris###evert academy in boca###raton , fla . as with most aspects of tennis training , repetition was the key to success . asked at wimbledon about her childhood drills , she said i think i enjoyed like the first half of the basket . and then like the other hundred balls that were left in there , i did n't like it so much . keys now practices her serve far less , hitting 50 to 150 per day . although she has had her serve clocked as fast as 120 miles###per###hour this year , keys said precision was a higher###priority than power . asked to name the women she considers the best servers , keys starts with the powerful servers serena###williams and sharapova , but then names agnieszka radwanska , who does not hit her serve hard but can reliably land it within inches of the line . i mean , i think power is great , but at the same time i think it 's a lot more about placement , and it 's the consistency , keys said . targets are used in many of keys 's drills , starting as large as cones and finishing as small as tennis###balls . on her best days , keys can hit a tennis###ball placed in the service box nearly at will . after power and accuracy comes strategy , and learning which of her many different serves to use at any given moment in a match . keys said she had as many as three distinct serving options on each point a kick serve , a flat serve and a slice . she added that she was looking to incorporate an effective body serve a jamming tactic straight at the opponent 's torso as a fourth option . i think my biggest###thing is learning when to hit which serve when , not doing the exact same thing over and over , she said . because o.k. , great , it 's 120 miles###per###hour , but they 're standing right there , and they just block it back . while the 5 foot 10 keys has the gifts of height and natural power , todero said , there remained room for significant###improvement . she can learn to place more , and use it more effectively according to the point situation , choosing the right serve , make the right decision on which side to choose , he said . and use more the legs . there 's a bunch of things she can do much better . the tennis analyst brad###gilbert said keys 's potential for further improvement on her serve was exciting . over the next three , four years , as she matures and gets stronger , when she 's in her early 20s i expect that thing to blossom to a whole other level , gilbert said . i mean she 's still , she 's still young , and still she has one of the best serves in the world . so there 's a lot of growth still that can be done . he added she has an easy motion . she has easy power . she has a nice easy swing . she has a high ball toss , which a lot of massive servers do n't have . but she has really good use of her legs . she 's not an arm server , not too much of a leg server , but she has a nice , easy , fluid motion . and she has a very live arm . the one thing that i 've###heard a couple times is that i just have a really smooth motion , and when i can get my rhythm going , it looks effortless , she said .
( reuters ) west###bromwich###albion striker nicolas###anelka will resume training on thursday after a week off on compassionate###grounds and will be available for sunday 's premier###league game against swansea###city , the club said on wednesday . the former france international had been excused for a few days following the sudden###death of his friend and agent eric manasse . he missed last weekend 's 0 0 draw at everton and tuesday 's league###cup second round victory over newport . west###brom manager steve###clarke admitted last week that the 34 year old anelka had told him he was considering retirement . albion can confirm that nicolas###anelka will resume first team training tomorrow and be available for selection for sunday 's game against swansea , the club said in statement on their website . anelka joined west###brom , his sixth premier###league###club , on a free###transfer last month and played in their opening defeat at home to southampton . west###brom have one point from two games .
in his last years the eminent conductor colin###davis , who died in april at , had debilitating stretches of poor###health . but he was clearly inspired for a concert performance in april 2012 of weber 's opera der###freisch###tz with the london###symphony###orchestra and chorus and an impressive cast . lso live recently###released a vibrant recording drawn from two performances at the barbican in london . der###freisch###tz , an early landmark of german romantic opera , had a triumphant premiere in berlin in 1821 and soon became an international success . the opera would seem to have lost its hold in recent###decades the metropolitan###opera last presented it in . davis had an affinity for the piece and recorded it memorably in 1990 with the staatskapelle###dresden . this new version is the one i will cherish , though . der###freisch###tz ( the freeshooter , set in bohemia at the end of the thirty###years' war , tells of a young forester , max , who loves agathe , the daughter of the region 's head forester . to win her , max must prove himself in a trial shoot . but he has already failed , as we learn from a taunting opening###chorus . max is tempted by the mysterious kaspar , another forester , to seek supernatural assistance and fashion magic bullets , which leads to fantastical complications . weber 's beguiling score is full of rustic energy and vivid evocations of the natural###world . the winning cast is headed by the tenor simon o'neill , who brings both heroic heft and mozartean lyricism to max . the luminous soprano christine###brewer is wonderful as agathe , the much praised richness of her singing marred only by tightness in some top notes . the astonishing wolf 's glen scene , when max enters a haunted realm of the forest , is weber at his most ingenious and davis 's performance captures the music 's ominous and magical allure . anthony###tommasini
long###beach , calif . natasha howard scored 16 points and pulled down 15 rebounds to lead the no . 24 florida###state women over long###beach###state 72 57 saturday . the seminoles ( 11 1 ) got 14 points apiece from yashira delgado and morgan###jones as the team shot over 48 percent from the floor . long###beach was led by alex sanchez' 21 points , while hallie meneses chipped in with 15 points . the 49 ers ( 7 5 ) were held to just 27 percent###shooting on the evening , including just 7 of 31 ( 23 percent ) from beyond the arc . long###beach###state was down by just one with 34 left in the first half after a pair of free throws by meneses , but a 10 0 run by florida###state including a pair of jumpers by delgado helped the seminoles race out to a 14 point###advantage at the intermission .
kansas###city , mo . even before the marshall henderson traveling salvation show rolled into the sprint###center on thursday , henderson , mississippi 's shooting###guard provocateur , pulled innocent###bystanders into his uncomfortable orbit via twitter . in the last few days , henderson insulted the national###invitation###tournament ( i know i would n't wanna be playin in the nit , he wrote during kentucky 's first round n.i.t . loss ) and praised the charismatic wisconsin forward mike bruesewitz , the one with the red , art###garfunkel style afro . that dude got some serious swag ! ! ! henderson said on twitter , meaning swagger , or moxie . with wisconsin ( 23 11 ) and mississippi ( 26 8 ) set to play friday in the round of 64 in the west region , such attention from the tournament 's most polarizing player was the last thing the normally loquacious bruesewitz needed . and henderson did not stop there . thursday in the mississippi locker###room , a grouchy henderson brightened when bruesewitz 's name came up . if i could grow###hair like that , i would rock it , henderson said . i want to buy his hair and wear it on halloween . that would be awesome . henderson added i 've watched wisconsin a lot on tv and heard bruesewitz give some of his interviews . he sounds like a colorful guy . people will trash on him a lot when they go on the road . i obviously feel him on that . he seems like a cool dude , and i ca n't###wait to actually meet him . this , remember , comes from someone who last week tagged southeastern###conference coaches as losers for not voting him first team all sec even though he led the conference in scoring , 3 pointers and free###throw shooting . a 6 foot 2 junior , henderson relishes his role as the sec house villain . last sunday , after henderson hit a 3 pointer against florida late in mississippi 's 66 63 victory in the sec###championship###game , he taunted florida fans by mimicking their trademark gator chomp . and thursday he took one more shot at the gators , who blew a 12 point###halftime###lead . we knew florida was about to fold , he said . they were up by . we knew kenny boynton was probably going to come out and try to go get m.v.p. , but we knew they had their own little seed locked up . we knew we needed it more than they needed it . this , now , is bruesewitz 's biggest###fan . i do n't care about what anybody said about my swag , bruesewitz said . i 've###heard about it all year . i might be the ugliest player in the big ten , i might be the best looking player in the big ten , i have crazy red hair , you should cut your hair . i 've###heard it all , and i really do n't care , because we 've won a lot of games and hopefully will continue to do that . the 6 6 bruesewitz already took enough ribbing from teammates this week when cosmopolitan###magazine named him one of the 26 hottest guys of march###madness . the photo caption aside from his impressive moves on the court , there 's just something about mike 's ginger fro that makes us swoon . i expected that , bruesewitz said , deadpan . i do n't know what you guys are all thinking about . my teammates did n't###expect that , either . i 'm not shocked . i 'm a good looking guy . i work really hard at it . his teammate ryan evans said that 's a good thing for him . i thought i should have been in there , but it 's good for mike . bruesewitz , who averages . 5 points and . 3 rebounds , may be the closest###thing the badgers have in spirit to henderson , though his eccentricities barely compare . bruesewitz keeps his right arm straight and wrist flexed after shooting 3 pointers , maintaining the pose a little longer if it goes in . he reacts to good plays by slapping a palm or extending one . when wisconsin eliminated top seeded indiana from the big###ten###tournament , 68 56 , an excited bruesewitz cradled the basketball and carried it to the handshake line . the curly hairstyle salutes his older###brother robert , a 6 8 former offensive###tackle at princeton who works for the department of defense . one christmas , robert came home with a huge afro because he refused to pay for a haircut . mike thought it looked cool and grew out his hair his sophomore year . it 's not for everybody , man , he said with a smile . how long 12th seeded mississippi remains in its first n.c.a.a . tournament since 2002 depends on whether henderson can exploit a wisconsin team known for its defense . the fifth seeded badgers led the rugged big ten in scoring###defense . 9 points a game ) and 3 point defense . 1 percent ) and allowed 133 3 pointers , the sixth fewest in division . henderson , in his first season at ole###miss , set university records for 3 point baskets ( 131 ) and attempts ( 367 ) while averaging . 1 points a game . mississippi has not scored fewer than 62 points in a game all season wisconsin is 5 6 when allowing 60 or more . henderson flies off screen , bruesewitz said . any glimmer of daylight , he 's pulling . he 's going to get shots and he 's probably going to get his , but we have to make him as inefficient as possible .

washington in an interview with student journalists , michelle###obama used the word normal again and again last friday in reference to her children . i want them to be normal kids , just like you guys , polite and respectful and kind , she said , according to 12 year old maggie mcdow of bexley , ohio , who was reporting for highlights magazine . i 'm winning , the first lady declared of her battle to give her children something resembling regular american girlhoods . that was 24 hours before malia and sasha obama , 14 and , embarked on one of the least normal three day weekends imaginable , their father 's second inauguration as president . within moments of malia and sasha 's appearance at church on monday###morning , their fashion choices ( j . crew for malia , kate###spade for sasha ) were reported along with those of their mother . as sasha arrived at her seat for the inaugural###ceremony , cameras beamed her face all over the national###mall and giant images of her head floated above the crowd as far as the eye could see . at the parade , the girls drew awwws as sasha took pictures of her parents kissing . when she yawned during the ceremony at the capitol , twitter lit up with excitement over her apparent boredom . literally every time sasha obama is on screen , she is n't paying###attention to anything and i really , really love that about her , casey turner of manhattan wrote on twitter . but aside from sasha 's slight restlessness during the long ceremony , the obama daughters appeared startlingly grown up , less like children and more like the adult caroline###kennedy and chelsea###clinton graceful and self possessed , bearing little sign of whatever intrusions they may have experienced in public life . as the camera lingered on the sisters before the ceremony started , they talked with their first cousins , seemingly schooled in the washington art of appearing to chitchat casually in full public view . at a concert for the children of military families on saturday , they listened to songs like teenage###dream , katy###perry 's tribute to adolescent lust , looking wholesome in no makeup and delicate jewelry . when they were marched onto the stage , their grins were sheepish , as if to say clap if you really want to , but we 're just the kids . one news photographer who shot the event said that malia and sasha turned their heads away from the cameras during the brief period he and his colleagues were allowed to click away either out of shyness or polite sabotage . when barack###obama first took the presidential###oath four years###ago , his clan seemed poised to redefine the very contours of a first family , with a sprawling , international , multiracial , multireligious group . but the kenyan family at the climax of his memoir , dreams from my father , has rarely been seen or heard from since the first inauguration , and instead the obamas tell a far more conventional tale about a nuclear###family . in the student interview last week , mrs . obama shared a few updates from life at home , painting her usual portrait of a tightly###knit , education minded family . the president recently missed a parent###teacher conference for the first time , she told maggie and the other student reporters . malia and her parents are currently making a project of reading classic american novels together , from catcher in the rye to tender is the night . now that malia is getting older , she is recommending more music to her mother , recently introducing her to the pop singer elle###varner . as the obama daughters filled television and computer screens in recent days , some commentators predicted that they would be more visible during their father 's second term , now that they were older . but the reverse could be true the obama girls are moving into the highly fraught realm of adolescence , with all of its social and academic demands . now that my girls are getting older , they do n't want to spend that much time with me anyway , so i 'll be probably calling around , looking for somebody to play cards with me or something , because i 'm getting kind of lonely in this big###house , the president said in a white###house news conference last week . the rituals of the teenage###years dates instead of play dates , college tours instead of ice###cream stops may require more privacy and protection , not less . malia will not depart for college until the final months of her father 's term , and sasha will be a 15 year old high###school student . but the country 's thirst to know more about them only seems to grow . type their names into google and some popular search###terms that appear include malia sasha grounded ( if they are , the white###house###press###secretary is not saying ) and malia and sasha bedrooms ( memo from a longtime obama watcher there is no way on earth mrs . obama would allow photographs of her children 's bedrooms on the internet . in the interview last week , mrs . obama did not say how malia and sasha felt about attending inauguration events . but she did say a bit about what their father 's re election meant to them for now , the girls are just happy not to have to change schools again .

vidalia , ga . for years , labor###unions and immigrant rights###activists have accused large###scale farmers , like those harvesting sweet vidalia onions here this month , of exploiting mexican guest###workers . working for hours on end under a punishing sun , the pickers are said to be crowded into squalid camps , driven without a break and even cheated of wages . but as congress weighs immigration legislation expected to expand the guest###worker###program , another group is increasingly crying foul americans , mostly black , who live near the farms and say they want the field work but cannot get it because it is going to mexicans . they contend that they are illegally discouraged from applying for work and treated shabbily by farmers who prefer the foreigners for their malleability . they like the mexicans because they are scared and will do anything they tell them to , said sherry tomason , who worked for seven years in the fields here , then quit . last month she and other local###residents filed a federal lawsuit against a large grower of onions , stanley farms , alleging that it mistreated them and paid them less than it paid the mexicans . the suit is one of a number of legal###actions containing similar###complaints against farms , including a large one in moultrie , ga . , where americans said they had been fired because of their race and national###origin , given less desirable jobs and provided with fewer work opportunities than mexican guest###workers . under a consent###decree with the equal###employment###opportunity###commission , the farm , southern valley , agreed to make certain changes . with local unemployment about 10 percent and the bureaucracy for hiring foreigners onerous guest###workers have to be imported and housed and require###extensive paperwork it would seem natural for farmers to hire from their own communities , which they did a generation ago . in fact , the farmers say , they would dearly like to . we have tried to fill our labor locally , said brian stanley , an owner of stanley farms , which is being sued by ms . tomason and others . but we could n't get enough workers , and that was hindering our growth . so we turned to the guest###worker###program . the vast###majority of farm workers in the country are not in the guest###worker###program but are simply unauthorized immigrants . the plan to place those workers on a path to legal status would reduce the chances of their being exploited , the bill 's sponsors say , and thereby also improve the status of americans who feel they cannot compete against vulnerable foreigners . mr . stanley , like other farmers , argues that americans who say they want the work end up quitting because it is hard , leaving the crops to rot in the fields . but the situation is filled with cultural and racial###tensions . even many of the americans who feel mistreated acknowledge that the mexicans who arrive on buses for a limited period are incredibly efficient , often working into the night seven days a week to increase their pay . we are not going to run all the time , said henry rhymes , who was fired unfairly , he says from southern valley after a week on the job . we are not mexicans . when jose gets on the bus to come here from mexico he is committed to the work , he said . it 's like going into the military . he leaves his family at home . the work is hard , but he 's ready . a domestic wants to know what 's the pay ? what are the conditions ? in these communities , i am sorry to say , there are no fathers at home , no role###models for hard work . they want rewards without input . such generalizations lead lawyers and residents to say there are racist undertones to the farms' policies . i am not arguing that agricultural work is a good job , said dawson morton , a lawyer who focuses on farm workers' rights at the georgia legal###services program , a nonprofit law###firm . i am arguing that it could be a better job . if you want experienced people , train them . just because people are easier to supervise , agricultural employers should n't be able to import them . it is not true that americans do n't want the work . what the farmers are really saying is that blacks just do n't want to work . to which j . larry stine , an atlanta lawyer for stanley farms and other big farms , replied the farmers are not racist or against americans . they have crops to be picked , and they see that domestics just do n't have their hearts in it .
washington a long###simmering dispute over the white###house 's account of the deadly assault on the american diplomatic compound in benghazi , libya , flared up on friday , with a disclosure of e mails that show the white###house was more deeply###involved in revising talking###points about the attack than officials have previously acknowledged . the e mails , which the administration turned over to congress , show the white###house coordinating an intensive###process with the state###department , the c.i.a. , the f.b.i . and other agencies to obtain the final###version of the talking###points , used by susan e . rice , the ambassador to the united###nations , in television appearances after the attack . the state###department , in particular , pushed to remove references to al###qaeda and ansar###al###sharia , the libyan militant###group suspected of carrying out the attack as well as warnings about other potential terrorist threats from the c.i.a. , which drafted the initial talking###points . ms . rice was later harshly###criticized as having misled the public about the nature of the attack in her television appearances . for republicans and other critics , the talking###points have become a potent symbol of the obama administration 's mishandling of the incident , even if they constitute only a part of the broader###issues , from embassy security to intelligence###gathering , that were raised by the attack . the e mails initially disclosed in a report last month by house republicans that was expanded on by the weekly###standard , the conservative magazine , and on friday in further detail by abc###news had the white###house scrambling to provide an explanation . early in the afternoon , it summoned reporters for a briefing by legal and political advisers who , under the ground###rules , could not be identified . in that session , the white###house asserted that the talking###points were not modified for political reasons and noted that they had originally been prepared at the request of congress . they said frequent , even exhaustive revision of talking###points was routine at the white###house . officials stuck to their contention that the only wording change the white###house made was to change the description of the benghazi annex from a consulate to a diplomatic###post . indeed , the e mails do not reveal major new details about the attack or other discrepancies in the administration 's evolving account of it . but when the white###house###press###secretary , jay###carney , arrived for his on camera briefing later in the day , he was questioned repeatedly on whether he or the administration deliberately###misled reporters last fall about the changes in the talking###points . mr . carney expressed no regrets and asserted that the c.i.a . rewrote the talking###points , although the e mails made clear that happened only after other agencies , including the state###department , weighed in . i do stand by that , mr . carney said of his statement that the white###house changed only a word or two to make clear the diplomatic###post in benghazi was not referred to as a consulate . white###house involvement in the talking###points was very limited and nonsubstantive . but in at least one briefing last fall , mr . carney said both the white###house and the state###department collectively made just one change , in contradiction to the e mails that show much more substantive revisions proposed by the state###department . the white###house and the state###department have made clear that the single adjustment that was made to those talking###points by either of those two , of these two institutions were changing the word 'consulate' to 'diplomatic facility , ' because 'consulate' was inaccurate , mr . carney said on nov . 28 . mr . carney said the reason changes were made was to make sure the talking###points did not go further than what was definitively known at the time . he accused the republicans of waging a partisan attack on the white###house . there 's an ongoing effort to make something political out of this , he said . the disclosures about how extensively the talking###points were revised also reveal the divisions that often exist among intelligence###agencies , as well as the bureaucratic infighting that often lies behind the bland language in official government statements . in this case , the state###department bridled at the c.i.a . 's initial###draft , both because it went further than what the department had been disclosing publicly and because it was apparently worried that c.i.a . warnings about other potential threats would reflect badly on the department . the c.i.a . 's first draft of the talking###points in the sept . 11 attack was e mailed to a group of senior officials at several federal###agencies shortly before 7 p.m . on sept . 14 , according to several officials . about 45 minutes later , the state###department 's spokeswoman , victoria###nuland , raised###concerns with the white###house and the intelligence###agencies , saying the information could be abused by members of congress to beat up the state###department for not paying###attention to warnings , so why would we want to feed that either ? c.i.a . officials responded with a new draft , but ms . nuland replied that the changes did not resolve all my issues or those of my building leadership . a state###department official said ms . nuland was expressing###concerns that the c.i.a . 's first versions of talking###points , intended to be made available to lawmakers , were more explicit than what she had been allowed to tell reporters . she also believed that the c.i.a. , which had more than 20 people in benghazi on the night of the attack , was trying to absolve itself at the state###department 's expense before any investigation was completed by suggesting that repeated c.i.a . warnings about the security situation in the city were being ignored , this official said . ms . nuland , a 29 year foreign###service veteran who has served under democratic and republican secretaries of state and was once an ambassador and a senior aide to vice###president dick###cheney , was not involved in the discussions after sept . 14 . she did not change the drafts , she did not edit them , the official said . the major changes in the talking###points came after a white###house meeting on sept . 15 , the day before ms . rice used them in her appearance on five sunday news shows , but a former official said that the state###department was not aware during the drafting###process that she would be using them for her tv appearances .
toronto an nhl season that nearly never was will be remembered as one that set the course for a bright new future in a seminal year bookended by a deal that secured a decade of labor peace and a multi###billion tv agreement . it was a rough start to 2013 with players locked out by owners , the new year 's day outdoor winter###classic canceled and the season on the brink of being scrapped before a last gasp deal in early###january salvaged a 48 game schedule . the year , however , will end on a much more upbeat note as national###hockey###league ( nhl ) commissioner gary###bettman announced last month a whopping 12 year . 2 billion canadian tv###rights deal that is the largest for the nhl . on another bargaining front , the nhl faced off with the international###ice###hockey###federation and international###olympic###committee before agreeing to extend their olympic participation so players can compete in the february 7 23 sochi games . while much of the drama was generated around negotiation tables there was plenty of action on the ice as well . the chicago###blackhawks claimed a second stanley###cup in four seasons by beating the boston###bruins in a pulsating , bone jarring final that pitted two of the league 's original six teams against each other for the first time since . a breathtaking postseason reminded disillusioned fans of all that is good and fascinating about ice###hockey , undoing a good chunk of the damage done by the bitter labor dispute . the season culminated in a rollicking finals that featured three overtimes before the stanley###cup was finally hoisted on a sweltering summer###night in boston when chicago scored twice in the final 76 seconds to clinch the best of seven series in six games in front of a stunned crowd . washington###capitals russian sniper alexander###ovechkin skated away with the nhl 's top individual###honors by claiming the hart###trophy as the league 's most valuable###player for a third time in six seasons along with the maurice###rocket###richard###trophy for being the leading###goal###scorer . but for all his accomplishments , ovechkin 's sparkling resume remained###incomplete as he was again unable to get his name engraved on the stanley###cup . flush with cash and a new 10 year labor deal in place , the nhl marketing machine shifted into high gear in , promoting the return of the winter###classic to detroit on january 1 where the red###wings will take on the toronto###maple###leafs in an outdoor game expected to attract an nhl record###crowd of nearly , 000 . operating under the belief you can never have too much of a good thing , the nhl announced it will stage six outdoor###games this season from los###angeles to new york . the outdoor extravaganza begins in detroit on new year 's day and ends with the vancouver###canucks and ottawa###senators squaring off in the heritage###classic at bc###place , the venue used for the opening###ceremonies of the 2010 vancouver olympics . in between , the nhl will stage a four game stadium series with contests at dodger###stadium in los###angeles , soldier###field in chicago and two games at new york 's yankee###stadium . one of the most important###things to come out of the negotiations was 10 years of labor peace and that is allowing us to begin to execute the plans we have for growing the game and growing revenues , john###collins , the nhl 's chief###operating###officer , told###reuters . we 've added a lot of blue###chip partners on the broadcast and the sponsorship side , who said they like where the game is and like where it 's going and want to spend###money promoting and activating around hockey . but just when it seemed like smooth sailing ahead , new storm###clouds arrived in the form of a class###action###lawsuit against the nhl last month by former players claiming the league did not do enough to reduce the risk of concussions . the lawsuit came less than three months after the national###football###league paid 765 million to settle a similar lawsuit brought by thousands of former players , many suffering from dementia and health problems . bettman , who has never backed away from a fight , dismissed the lawsuit and immediately###issued a statement saying the nhl intended to defend the case vigorously .
los###angeles the university###of###southern###california football###team has spent its recent days being greeted by elvis , entertained by acrobatic dancers and preparing for saturday 's las###vegas###bowl against fresno state . but steve###sarkisian , the team 's newly###hired coach , has a more pressing concern hoping that what happens in seattle stays in seattle . sarkisian , who left the university of washington for u.s.c . earlier this month , was under scrutiny as n.c.a.a . investigators along with officials from both universities planned to meet friday with a high###school coach who has accused a washington assistant###coach of providing him with , 500 to pay for a recruit 's private###tutoring . the assistant , tosh lupoi , whom sarkisian had been interested in hiring at u.s.c. , posted a message on his twitter###account denying the allegations , which were detailed wednesday by the los###angeles###times . a broader question is whether the allegations , if true , will stick to sarkisian amid a new , as yet untested penalty structure that was set in place to hold coaches more accountable for the actions of their staffs . pat###haden , u.s.c . 's athletic###director , was part of the 20 member committee that developed the new punishments . sarkisian , who has denied to u.s.c . officials any knowledge of the allegations , said thursday while attending the trojans' final bowl practice i did everything in my power to promote a compliant atmosphere , and i 'm going to do the exact same thing here at u.s.c . if and or when the n.c.a.a . wants to talk to me , i 'll feel###confident in my ability to show , factually , the ability that i exhibited to promote that atmosphere . this is only the latest drama surrounding u.s.c . coaches in a season that has been filled with them . lane###kiffin , who was hired away from tennessee under acrimonious circumstances in , was removed from the team bus on the way back from a loss at arizona###state and told he was being fired . ed###orgeron , the popular assistant who led the team to six wins in its final eight games , quit after he was not chosen as kiffin 's permanent replacement . clay helton , the offensive###coordinator , who is unlikely to return , is coaching the team in the las###vegas###bowl . the game could be the final one at u.s.c . for receiver marqise###lee , last year 's biletnikoff###award winner as the nation 's outstanding college receiver . lee , who endured an injury plagued season but is still coveted by n.f.l . teams , is among a half###dozen juniors who are considering leaving a development that could be a significant blow to a roster that , while it remains talented , has been robbed of crucial depth by n.c.a.a . penalties . not long###ago , sarkisian might have counted on lupoi to persuade those players to stay . lupoi , 32 , has a reputation as one of the pacific 12 conference 's best recruiters , but he has also been disciplined at least twice . he was suspended for one game while an assistant at california in 2010 for instructing his players to fake injuries to slow down oregon 's hurry up offense . in , shortly after he was hired at washington , lupoi was banned from recruiting on the road that spring after committing a minor n.c.a.a . violation . sarkisian has brought three of his washington assistants with him to u.s.c. , and the defensive###coordinator justin###wilcox , the quarterbacks###coach marques###tuiasosopo and lupoi were also expected to head south after the huskies played in the kraft fight###hunger###bowl on dec . 27 . it now appears extremely unlikely that lupoi will go to u.s.c. , where questions about n.c.a.a . violations remain a touchy subject . the university is in the midst of significant penalties a two year bowl ban and the loss of 30 scholarships in the wake of the reggie###bush scandal . although the football programs at miami and penn###state have had their sanctions reduced , u.s.c . 's appeal was denied despite efforts at reform that have included beefing up its compliance staff and creating what haden called a culture of compliance . haden clearly hoped that he would be avoiding compliance questions when he hired sarkisian , who had been an assistant###coach at u.s.c . haden said that two senior athletic###department officials , mark###jackson and steve lopes , had been advocates for sarkisian . it helps because when you know someone , you know their flaws , haden said in an interview after sarkisian 's introductory news conference dec . 2 . everybody has flaws . the people you do n't know , you do n't know their flaws . so while it was never the deciding###factor , if it 's a jump###ball , maybe it helps you one way or another .
san###diego they have been rolling out incrementally this year , individual###pieces to a puzzle that the mets hope will take form next year to complete a winning baseball###team . the latest one surfaced here saturday###afternoon , when catcher travis###d'arnaud , 24 , became the sixth mets rookie to make his club debut this season . it was a highly###anticipated one , second only to the right hander zack wheeler 's two months###ago . it was a convenient one , too , as john###buck , the team 's starting###catcher , went back to new york on a three day paternity leave . the mets will use buck 's absence as a way to observe d'arnaud up close , see how he responds to the challenges he faces his first days as a major###leaguer , and figure out how much he can offer as the season winds down . this is the perfect opportunity , said manager terry###collins , who batted d'arnaud sixth against the padres ( he went 0 for 2 with two walks . it 's a ca n't###miss situation . we 're going to bring him up here , give him a chance to play here the next three days , and we 'll make a determination on monday what the next move 's going to be . the buzz around d'arnaud has been loud and persistent since the mets acquired him from the blue###jays as part of the trade package that sent r . a . dickey , last year 's national###league cy###young###award###winner , to toronto . still , the mets are not exactly sure what they have . baseball###america rated d'arnaud as the game 's no . 23 prospect before this season , and when the mets got a look at him during spring###training , they liked both his talent and his demeanor . the assumption was that d'arnaud would join the mets at some point during the summer , but that schedule was derailed on april , when he fractured a metatarsal while playing for the mets' class aaa###affiliate in las###vegas . it was disappointing for the club and the player , who had missed considerable time after tearing the posterior###cruciate###ligament in his left knee during a class###aaa game last year . he went through a lengthy , stop and start rehabilitation###program this summer only returning to class###aaa play on aug . 9 but appears to be at full strength again . it feels back to normal like it was in april , and it feels good , d'arnaud said on saturday about his foot . i do n't even notice it all anymore . collins on saturday lauded d'arnaud 's presence behind the plate . the mets' hopes for d'arnaud stem from his impressive bat he batted . 304 in 19 class###aaa games this year but his earliest challenges will involve handling the club 's staff , learning about them and earning their trust . wheeler , matt###harvey and jon###niese are expected to form the rotation 's core next year . jenrry mejia , who started saturday , has the potential to be a key component , too . d'arnaud spent saturday###morning listening to game plans from bob###geren , the club 's bench###coach . he had conversations with each pitcher . it all will be a crash course to some extent , but a necessary one to gauge his readiness . once buck 's paternity leave expires , the mets will have to decide whether to keep d'arnaud or anthony recker , the current backup . we 're certainly hoping he stays , collins said . now , is that a plan going in ? no . but you 've just got to hope that he 's ready to show us he belongs here . i think the next three days we 'll get a feel for where he 's at , what we need to do and where we are with his development . the game was a homecoming of sorts for d'arnaud , who grew up near los###angeles , and several family members made the two hour###drive to petco###park to witness his first game . it was a long###awaited debut . sandy###alderson , the mets' general###manager , said on friday that it would be exciting to see d'arnaud wearing a mets uniform . next year , alderson 's long###term###plan to revive the team will be expected to bear fruit . d'arnaud claimed not to be particularly conscious about how he fit into the 2014 puzzle . i have n't###heard a lot or read into much of it , he said . but i know sandy 's done a great job getting a whole bunch of players over here , and i 'm really excited . that 's for sure . he was the latest , and one of the most intriguing , from that bunch . wilmer flores , who sprained his right ankle on monday###night , was deemed healthy enough to play third base on saturday after being limited to a pinch###hitting for four straight###games . i do n't think he 's 100 percent , but he can play , terry###collins said . you know , he 's not a blazer , so we 're not worried about him losing a lot of speed . we 're worried about making sure he can stop and start .
birds###eye , the frozen vegetable brand , will introduce new tv advertising for its steamfresh chef 's favorites side dishes on feb . 4 , the first work by its latest ad agency , bbdo . timed to coincide with peak consumption of frozen vegetables , the new campaign comes during a period of flat growth for the category . according to the symphonyiri group , dollar sales of all frozen vegetables in united###states supermarkets , drugstores and mass###market retailers grew only . 05 percent in the year ending dec . 30 , 2012 , to . 02 billion , compared with . 3 percent growth in dollar sales in the year ending jan . 1 , 2012 . dollar sales of birds###eye , which generated almost one quarter of all 2012 dollar sales , declined . 1 percent last year , compared with a.4 percent###drop in dollar sales by green###giant , which generated 18 percent of all dollar sales , the symphonyiri group also said . birds###eye , a brand of pinnacle###foods , previously###worked with the new york office of tbwa , part of the omnicom###group , which last year created new advertising that depicted a vegetable harvest at a picturesque farm in the midst of a snowstorm , urging viewers to discover the wonder of birds###eye . the latest campaign , by the new york office of bbdo , another omnicom unit , shows how mothers in this case , mothers of dolphin , wolf and bear families , brought to life through the use of voice###overs complete family meals by serving steamfresh chef 's favorites side dishes . these dishes contain bite size pieces of foods and are aimed at families with children age 6 to . rodrigo troni , senior###vice###president for marketing at birds###eye , said the brand which was bought by pinnacle###foods , owned by the blackstone###group , in 2009 had decided to switch to bbdo , which also works with pinnacle###foods' duncan###hines and vlasic brands , to consolidate with one major agency . although the tbwa campaign helped the category show how relevant it is , that it 's always vegetable season , birds###eye now wants to connect with consumers in terms of usage , mr . troni said . to that end , the three new 15 second tv spots are based on research by birds###eye that found that moms have an everyday dinner dilemma , mr . troni said , adding they want to serve a complete meal more often , a meal that 's nutritionally better , tastes great and is emotionally satisfying for the mother , who does n't have time to cook . to illustrate this concept , tim bayne , an executive###creative###director in the new york office of bbdo , said the agency had decided that instead of depicting a human family at a dinner###table , watching them react to delicious vegetables , which we 've seen a thousand###times , we thought we 'd just have fun with the family part . we needed carnivores that had a little cuteness to them , the kid animals had to be cute . one spot depicts a dolphin family underwater , with the mother saying she was considering serving rotini and broccoli with cheese sauce with fish for dinner . in another spot , a bear###family fishes for salmon in a river the mother says she will serve asian medley with it for dinner . a third spot features a wolf family , in which the father asks the mother what she is serving with chicken at dinner that night she replies potatoes and green###beans . all spots end with the announcer urging viewers to turn vegetables you want to serve into vegetables they want to eat . birds###eye , now dinner 's complete . they will appear , starting on feb . 4 , on cable###networks like the food###network , the cooking###channel , lifetime , own , tbs and tnt . similar digital advertising will break in march . mr . troni said the budget for the new campaign would exceed 10 million through . according to kantar###media , the brand spent . 6 million on advertising in , and . 4 million in the first nine months of , compared with . 4 million in the same period in . green###giant spent 13 million in the first nine months of , up from . 8 million in the same period in , kantar###media said . green###giant introduced a major new campaign late last year . patti williams , an associate###professor of marketing at the wharton###school at the university of pennsylvania , called the campaign a continuation of the brand 's recent###efforts to promote###healthy eating by children through an agreement with partnership for a healthier america and collaboration with icarly , the nickelodeon show . birds###eye , she said , is recognizing that parents know they need to make healthier food choices for their children and that they continue to find that a challenge . tom meyvis , an associate###professor of marketing at the stern###school###of###business at new york###university , said he doubted that parents would find the ads credible because kids are not so excited about eating steamed vegetables . he added a better approach would be to connect to reality at the beginning of the ad , with kids bored with their vegetables . they could then show a meal complete with vegetables , now with the kids excited . larry finkel , director of food and beverage research for marketresearch . com , said that although the new spots pepper in a kid pleasing product , with characters with funny voices , the agency did an amateurish job in execution .
boston ( reuters ) a boeing 787 dreamliner aircraft with no passengers on board caught fire at logan###international###airport in boston on monday when a battery in its auxiliary electrical system exploded , officials said . a mechanic inspecting the japan###airlines jet discovered smoke in the cockpit while performing a routine postflight inspection and reported it to airport authorities around 30 a.m . eastern time , said bob donahue , the fire chief of the massachusetts###port###authority . a fire crew responded and determined that a battery used to power the plane 's electrical###systems when the engines are not running had exploded , chief donahue said . the mechanic was the only person on board the plane when the smoke was discovered , and no one was hurt by the fire , he added . passengers were in no danger , as this event had happened at least 15 minutes after they deplaned , chief donahue said . the fire is the latest reported mechanical###failure in a string of incidents affecting boeing 's new dreamliner , which was also plagued by production problems that delayed initial delivery by three and a half years . a boeing spokesman , marc birtel , said the company was aware of the fire and was working with japan###airlines on the problem . officials with the federal###aviation###administration are looking into what caused the fire , chief donahue said . the national###transportation###safety###board also announced it was opening an investigation . the 787 relies###heavily on electrical###power to drive onboard systems that in other jet models are run by air###pressure generated by the engines . it also experienced electrical problems during testing that prompted a redesign . the dreamliner has experienced a string of problems with its electrical###systems in recent weeks . on dec . 4 , a united###airlines flight from houston to newark made an emergency###landing after it appeared that one of its power###generators had failed . on dec . 13 , qatar###airways said it had grounded one of its three 787 jets because of the same problem united experienced . on dec . 17 , united said that a second 787 in its fleet had developed electrical problems .
sooner or later , everything old is new again , especially on television . in a season when the hollywood gene###pool teems with fresh specimens , some familiar###faces are shaking things up , defying stereotypes and showing those newbies how it 's done . mid glorious career , four veteran actors are revealing different sides of themselves . maybe we do n't know them as well as we thought we did . last month , margo###martindale and her husband , william boals , drove from their home on the upper west side of manhattan , pulled into los###angeles seven days later with their dog , looked at each other and almost started to cry . we sat in this beautiful yard with this beautiful pool and thought , 'now what ? ' she recalled . the couple had changed coasts after ms . martindale was cast on the cbs sitcom the millers , starring will arnett as a roving television reporter whose divorce prompts his father ( beau###bridges ) to leave his mother ( ms . martindale . when mom who ca n't###understand why everyone is n't as smitten with her as she is suddenly moves in with son , two 's most definitely a crowd . with the millers ms . martindale is satisfying her good girl yearning after a spate of characters like mags bennett on justified . playing that real smart , shrewd redneck killer , in her words , earned her an emmy . it was , said ms . martindale , as if i 'd stepped into something i had been meant to play most of my life . after originating the role of truvy in the 1987 off###broadway production of steel###magnolias , ms . martindale , now , assumed she 'd end up in sitcoms until fate and a manhattan###theater###club producer sent her down a more dramatic road . she is up for an emmy this year for her portrayal of a soviet spymaster in the americans on fx . it 's fun to come back to comedy , she said . it 's like stagecraft . you are playing to an audience . and the other day , when she got a laugh where she did n't###expect it ? it was like , 'whoa , yeah ! ' you wo n't###hear him screaming stella ! in his latest role , although he does yell a lot . but blair###underwood might never have portrayed robert ironside had robert###greenblatt , the chairman of nbc entertainment , not seen his turn as stanley###kowalski in a###streetcar###named###desire on broadway last year . the result was ironside , a retooling of the 1967 raymond###burr drama , this time starring mr . underwood as a new york###city police detective paralyzed from the waist down after being shot . flashbacks to an able bodied ironside unravel the mystery of what went wrong two years###earlier , and why his former partner ( brent###sexton ) still has nightmares . describing both kowalski and ironside as aggressive and animalistic , mr . underwood , 49 , said each role can be straightforward and mercurial and volcanic but also very vulnerable all at once . he continued , i 've###played that character in independent films and onstage , but i have n't done him a lot in mainstream###television , where he 's still perhaps best remembered as the cocky charmer jonathan rollins on nbc 's l.a . law . then there 's the challenge of learning to maneuver through life in a wheelchair , something he has watched his mother , who has multiple###sclerosis , do for more than a decade . it takes repetition and making yourself comfortable in that character as much as possible , and to that end it 's about being emotionally and psychologically connected to someone who deals with that every day , said mr . underwood , who got help on that from his technical###adviser , david###bryant , who has been paralyzed for more than 30 years . like his girlfriend said , 'he wears his chair . ' oh , those eyes . it 's a rare fan who has n't dreamed of swimming in michael###ealy 's limpid pools . as blue and warm as the caribbean , that gaze seized hearts and corrupted wills in think like a man , the film adapted from steve###harvey 's relationship###advice book , with a sequel in the works , and showtime 's sleeper###cell , for which mr . ealy earned a golden###globe nomination as an f.b.i . agent who infiltrates a group of islamic terrorists . so how did mr . sensitivity end up being cast as an android ?
with those choice words , and several more similar in tone , the chief###executive of an american tire company touched off a furor in france on wednesday as he responded to a government plea to take over a goodyear factory slated for closing in northern###france . i have visited the factory a couple of times , maurice###taylor jr . , the head of titan international , wrote to the country 's industry minister , arnaud###montebourg , in a letter published in french newspapers on wednesday . the french work force gets paid high###wages but works only three hours . they have one hour for their breaks and lunch , talk for three and work for three . i told this to the french unions to their faces and they told me , 'that 's the french way ! ' added mr . taylor , a swaggering businessman who is nicknamed the grizz by wall###street analysts for his abrasive negotiating style . his decidedly undiplomatic assessment quickly struck a nerve in france , where concerns about declining competitiveness and the divisive tax policies of president###fran###ois###hollande 's government have led some economists to ask whether the nation is at risk of becoming the next sick###man###of###europe . mr . montebourg , who is known for lashing out at french corporate bosses without hesitation , initially seemed at a loss for words on how to respond to the american charge . i do not want to harm french interests , he said when asked about mr . taylor 's letter . later , mr . montebourg released a letter to mr . taylor , calling the executive 's comments extreme and insulting , adding that they pointed to a perfect ignorance about france and its strengths , which continue to attract international###investors . french media###outlets minced no words . incendiary ! insulting ! and scathing ! were just a few of the terms replayed on french newspaper web###sites and on the airwaves throughout the day . the french blogosphere lit up with hundreds of remarks condemning the predatory american corporate###culture that mr . taylor seemed to represent other commentators who ventured to admit that there might be something to mr . taylor 's observations were promptly bashed . and france 's main labor###union wasted no time in weighing in . micka###l wamen , the head of the conf###d###ration###g###n###rale du###travail union at the goodyear plant , in amiens , said mr . taylor belonged in a psychiatric ward . a spokesman for mr . taylor did not immediately respond to calls for comment . france 's 35 hour###workweek , its rigid labor market and the influence that labor###unions hold over the workplace have long been a source of aggravation for businesses . last month , after a government report warning that french competitiveness was slipping , labor###unions and business###leaders struck a deal to overhaul swaths of the labor code , a move mr . hollande said was needed to burnish france 's international allure as a place to do business . with unemployment above 10 percent and growth slowing , the government has also been desperate to avoid large###scale layoffs . mr . montebourg has even brandished the threat of nationalization to try to save jobs . psa###peugeot###citro###n , arcelormittal , sanofi and air###france all announced big###job cuts last year as europe 's long running debt crisis hit their bottom lines . so it was no surprise that mr . montebourg approached titan international last year to ask if it would take over the goodyear factory , which was scheduled to close because of labor###disputes and sagging profitability a move that would threaten , 173 jobs . titan had already considered taking over the goodyear factory 's farm tire operations . but it dropped the plan in 2011 after union representatives opposed a deal , saying they suspected titan would close production of passenger###vehicle tires if the group took over . tensions between mr . taylor and the union were evident at the time in a titan news release , which included mr . taylor 's observation that only a nonbusiness person would understand the french labor rules . in january , mr . montebourg tried to entice titan back to the negotiating###table , saying he hoped unions would put some water in their wine , that managers put some wine in their water , and that titan would drink the wine and the water of both and reach an accord . but late last month , as union workers protested en###masse at the amiens site , with a large police presence , goodyear told workers it would close the plant and cut its french work force by 39 percent . in his letter , dated feb . 8 , mr . taylor explained his reasons for refusing to come back to the negotiating###table . goodyear tried for over four years to save part of the amiens jobs that are some of the highest###paid , but the french unions and the french government did nothing but talk , mr . taylor wrote . sir , your letter says you want titan to start a discussion , he added . how stupid do you think we are ? titan is the one with the money and the talent to produce tires . what does the crazy union have ? it has the french government . he said his company would seek to produce cheaper tires in india or china , where he said titan would pay the workers less than one euro an hour , and then sell the tires back to the french . he predicted that michelin , the french tiremaker , would not be able to compete with lower###prices and would have to halt production in france within five years . you can keep your so called workers , he wrote . titan is not interested in the amiens factory . in his response , mr . montebourg reacted###strongly to what he called mr . taylor 's condemnable calculation and noted that france and its european partners were working to stop illegal###dumping of imports . in the meantime , he added , rest assured that you can count on me to have the competent government###agencies survey your imported tires with a redoubled zeal .
dayton , ohio indiana 's christian watford , remy abell and yogi ferrell watched gonzaga lose to wichita###state from their hotel###room saturday###night , enjoying the way the shockers hit shots and felled a top seed in the n.c.a.a . tournament 's opening###weekend . less than 18 hours later , they were beginning to understand the feeling of getting caught from behind , of succumbing to the wave of upsets , of having a dream season dashed by a less heralded team . they were trailing against temple . time was ticking . hope was sinking . there were chills from here to bloomington , ind . , and even beyond perhaps to washington , where the east region semifinals looked as if they would proceed without their headliner . but , unlike gonzaga the night before , indiana summoned enough to advance . the hoosiers made key defensive stops and leaned on victor###oladipo to sneak by with a 58 52 victory . they were as tough a team as we 've seen all year , indiana coach tom crean said of the owls . oladipo 's 3 pointer with 14 seconds###left gave indiana a###4 point lead , and his raised arm pose as the shot went through was reminiscent of a player he has drawn subtle , albeit premature , comparisons to michael###jordan . the shot will certainly reverberate in indiana for the remainder of the team 's tournament run . so will a blocked shot by watford on temple 's anthony lee with 2 minutes 18 seconds remaining , an attempt that would have put the owls ahead by . instead , cody###zeller made two game tying free throws , and temple never led again . that 's what winners do , zeller said . you 've got to survive and advance this time of year . shortly after second seeded ohio###state needed a last second 3 pointer by aaron###craft to beat iowa###state , indiana was being challenged by temple , led by khalif wyatt , who finished with 31 points . indiana committed eight turnovers in the first half and gave up a 9 point lead to trail at halftime , 29 26 . it was the hoosiers' second lowest###point###total in any half this season . i could n't have been more proud of how this team competed today , temple coach fran###dunphy said . i would have all good things to say and feel and remember about this group . wyatt was an offensive force from everywhere on the floor , even against indiana , one of the toughest defensive teams in the nation . it hardly mattered if abell , will sheehey or oladipo , the big ten 's defensive###player of the year , guarded him . wyatt was undeterred . he scored 20 points in the first half , but oladipo said he allowed wyatt too much space to get comfortable . in the second half , that changed . just made it hard for him to catch the ball , oladipo said . we tried to limit his touches and make it hard for him to even move . wyatt failed to make a field###goal in the final 35 , when indiana was face guarding him and mimicking his movements all the way up the court . they were denying me the ball when they could , wyatt said . they pretty much took me out of the game . indiana , which shot . 4 percent in the second half , never trailed by more than . still there was noticeable consternation among the red clad fans in the stands . jordan hulls hit two key second half jumpers , and the 7 foot zeller went to work on temple 's frontcourt players , putting the owls in foul###trouble . the block by watford , a senior , swung the momentum to the hoosiers , and for the first time in the second half , they were able to sustain it . watford called it the biggest play of his career . then there was oladipo , indiana 's most electrifying player in years , who was quiet in the first half but got going in the second . his late 3 pointer came after a pass from zeller ( 15 points , who gathered himself in the post and drew a second defender before passing the ball to oladipo , who was open at the top of the key . i was just open , and i shot it , said oladipo , who finished with 16 points . it really did n't have anything to do with the moment or the confidence to shoot it . i just caught it and shot it . i did n't think about it . the assistant tim###buckley said , that 's a shot victor has been working on every day at 7 a.m . the hoosiers were nearly toppled sunday , similar to how gonzaga went down on saturday . not to the hoosiers . not on sunday . there were a lot of different games going on in the game tonight , crean said . there was our start . there was the middle of the second half . there was how we ended . he added i 'm proud of their maturity . i do n't think an immature team has a chance to win this game .
philadelphia chase###utley is staying in those red pinstripes . utley and the phillies agreed to a contract that could keep the five time all star second baseman in philadelphia through at least the 2015 season , two people familiar with the deal told the associated press on wednesday###night . they spoke on condition of anonymity because the contract has n't been finalized . the deal reportedly is worth around 27 million over two seasons with multiple vesting options . utley has battled knee injuries in the past , but that has n't been a problem this year . he missed a month with an oblique injury . we 'd like to keep the man in our pinstripes , general###manager ruben amaro jr . said last week . utley declined to specifically talk about the extension following the phillies' 5 2 loss to chicago on wednesday###night . i love philadelphia , he said . i 've always envisioned playing here . i 've never envisioned playing anywhere else . utley , who turns 35 on dec . 17 , would 've been a free###agent after the season . he 's in the last year of an 85 million contract signed in january . utley was n't in the starting###lineup against the chicago###cubs on wednesday###night , but drove in the tying run with a pinch single in the seventh###inning . utley then knocked over catcher dioner###navarro in a violent collision trying to score from second base on a single . navarro held onto the ball and utley was out . navarro was carted off the field with a left leg###injury . utley was hitting . 277 with 15 homers and 43 rbis in 84 games . he has n't played more than 115 games in a season since 2009 because of chronic knee problems . between , utley averaged . 301 , 29 homers and 101 rbis . he has n't hit more than 16 homers or driven in more than 65 runs since . still , retaining utley was a priority for amaro . the gritty , hard###nosed utley is one of the all time fan###favorites in philadelphia , revered by fans who love tough players . he 's a leader on a team that has struggled the past two years after winning five straight division titles and the 2008 world###series . veteran catcher carlos###ruiz and former ace roy###halladay also are in the final###years of their contracts , and amaro has stated interest in keeping both .
london###england outclassed moldova 4 0 to top world###cup qualifying###group h after two goals from danny###welbeck and one each from captain steven###gerrard and rickie###lambert sealed a comfortable victory at wembley on friday . the result gave england the perfect lift ahead of tuesday 's more difficult game in ukraine , who kept alive their chances of qualifying for next year 's finals in brazil with a 9 0 rout of san###marino . with previous group###leaders montenegro drawing 1 1 in poland , england head the group with 15 points from seven matches ahead of montenegro , who have played one game more , on goal###difference . ukraine have 14 points and poland 10 from seven . but england manager roy###hodgson , delighted with the three points , was not happy that welbeck , who had an outstanding game , was booked and will miss tuesday 's match . welbeck was handed what appeared to be a soft yellow###card from slovakian referee ivan kruzliak for kicking the ball at the exact###moment the referee###blew the whistle for an offside shortly before halftime . it was his second booking of the campaign and he proved just how much he will be missed in ukraine when he scored his first of the match moments later and his second five minutes after the break . the yellow###card has overshadowed the win for me , hodgson told###reporters . you will have to work very , very hard to persuade me that was a booking . he has got a yellow###card , he is out of the game , we will live with it and deal with it . did i think it was a yellow###card or the right decision ? no , i did n't . welbeck also had a hand in the first goal and the manchester united forward , who has scored six times in his last seven england matches , will be missed in kiev especially as his united team###mate wayne###rooney is sidelined and liverpool striker daniel###sturridge is also unlikely to play because of injury . welbeck showed brilliant skill in the build up to the first goal by gerrard , who scored with a low strike after 12 minutes , before lambert made it 2 0 with a header in the 26th . welbeck wrapped up the victory by scoring either side of halftime . the match was effectively over by the break after england dominated the first 45 minutes as gerrard , jack###wilshere and frank###lampard , winning his 99th cap , took a firm grip on midfield with the skipper playing as the defensive lynchpin . moldova are 123rd in fifa 's world###rankings and england keeper joe###hart did not have a save to make in a one sided affair that fizzled out after the fourth###goal . the opening###goal settled any england nerves and the hosts assumed complete###control when lambert , who scored with his first touch on his debut against scotland three weeks###ago , made it 2 0 with another header after goalkeeper stanislav namasco , who had a woeful match , parried theo###walcott 's drive . welbeck made it 3 0 with a well taken goal in first half stoppage time , collecting a long through ball from walcott to outpace namasco and touch the ball home . his second came five minutes after the break when he dinked a left###foot shot into an empty net with namasco again in the wrong place . moldova manager ion caras summed up his team 's miserable performance by saying considering the superiority of the hosts , we could have lost by a far bigger margin . but having said that , some of the goals were our own fault and you cannot make mistakes like that against teams like england . moldova stay fifth in the six team group with one win from eight matches and still have to play san###marino and montenegro .
low cost 3 d plastic printers can produce almost anything , from clothes and toys to household###items and furniture . now , researchers from michigan###technological###university say they have developed an affordable 3 d metal printer . for years , large###companies have used metal printers to make items like automobile parts and titanium body implants , said joshua pearce , a materials scientist at michigan###tech who led the research and wrote about it in the journal ieee access . those printers are awesome , but they start at a half a million###dollars and go up , he said . the researchers' 3 d metal printer cost less than , 500 . they used open###source###software and off the shelf components , including a microcontroller and a small welding machine , and made a sprocket with it . dr . pearce cautioned that the printer was more dangerous to use than a 3 d plastic printer , requiring more safety gear . this is not something for everybody 's house , he said . still , he said , the technology would give small###companies an inexpensive , rapid way to build prototypes . scientists could use the printer to build tools for research . and developing###countries could use it to print repair###parts for machines like windmills . if there were one per village or region , he said , the parts could be made right within the community .

london our secondary###school , a fairly average one in the rural english town of yeovil , population , 000 , was , like the majority of others in the country , very much a hot###spot for soccer as the 1990s unfolded . soccer was what we played and talked about during morning breaks , at lunchtime and after classes . but right around the middle of the decade , as i became a teenager , something strange began happening . instead of the usual obsession with the premier###league , england 's top soccer grouping , n.b.a . sticker albums began###appearing in our class rather than talking about soccer stars like ryan###giggs , alan###shearer and john###barnes , we would spend our lunch###breaks swapping images of michael###jordan , patrick###ewing and hakeem###olajuwon . the phenomenon spread to playing###basketball itself hoops sprung up all over the place , including one in the garden of my parents' home , which remains albeit with a severely weathered net to this day . a lone sticker of gary###payton in the green and yellow of the seattle###supersonics still adorns the inside of a cupboard in my childhood bedroom . that clear jump in the n.b.a . 's popularity in britain in the mid 1990s came partly courtesy of the extensive league coverage on channel , then one of four free , over the air broadcast channels that were beamed into just about every home in the country . it helped , of course , that the###dream team had captured the world 's imagination at the 1992 olympics and that the n.b.a . was in the midst of a golden###age of talent , led by jordan and backed by a strong supporting###cast of future###hall###of###famers . basketball , traditionally seen as something of an inner city game here , even began to creep into england 's suburbs . really . no , basketball was not about to shove soccer aside , even a little bit , but the n.b.a . was clearly intriguing to me , to my friends , to enough other people in england to create some viability for the league in this country . here were these superstars from a different world , giants who strutted their stuff in such glamorous locations as madison###square###garden . how could one not be interested ? fast###forward the best part of two decades , and on the face of it the n.b.a . continues to have some traction in britain , maybe more than it did when i first got interested . when the knicks meet the detroit###pistons at the o2 arena in london on thursday , they will do so in front of a capacity###crowd that was certainly not coerced into attending . the match was the quickest to sell out of the 11 preseason and regular###season###games the n.b.a . has staged in this country since , with every ticket being snapped up within four days of going on sale . but while the n.b.a . can generate some interest here even if the wednesday editions of many of the country 's national###newspapers had no advance coverage of the game domestic basketball on a professional level in britain is another story . it does not resonate anywhere near the way it does in such countries as spain or greece or turkey . in fact , it often does not resonate much at all . the british###basketball###league has struggled to establish itself , with many crowds for games registering in the triple digits and virtually no coverage in the sports pages . the lions franchise , which recently###moved to london , plays in an arena that holds , 800 and its recent crowd of , 200 for a game against leicester riders was its highest of the season . that is not to belittle the lions they will soon move into the copper###box venue on the site of the olympic###park and are new to london 's sporting landscape . but they , like all british basketball teams , are up against it when it comes to drawing support and interest . even the brighton###bears' experiment with recruiting dennis###rodman to play a few games as a publicity###stunt in 2006 could not force british basketball into the mainstream consciousness . euroleague###basketball the hoop version of the champions###league usually features teams from turkey , germany , italy , spain and even israel . but not england . but the british###basketball###league 's cup###final last sunday , in birmingham , drew a capacity###crowd of , 500 . it was the largest cup###final on record , noted david leyden dunbar , who is the commercial###director of the 12 team league and who also noted that ticket###sales were up 20 percent this season .
uniondale , n.y . seven games into a lockout###shortened 48 game regular###season , the devils knew they would be tested sunday . they responded with a stout defensive###effort in front of the reserve goalie johan###hedberg before erupting for three goals in the final 3 minutes 54 seconds in beating the islanders , 3 0 . it was an important win for us , bryce###salvador , the devils' captain , said . it was an important game in terms of how we responded and how we played . we played a great###game , and we played for 60 minutes . the defending eastern###conference###champion devils had bowed to the islanders , 5 4 , in overtime at home on thursday###night . they had a number of lapses , and their penalty killing unit was ineffective as the islanders converted three of four power play opportunities . in contrast , the devils lacked punch with the man advantage , failing in five tries . the devils' play deteriorated further on saturday###night , when they absorbed their first defeat in regulation in a 5 1 loss at pittsburgh , the atlantic###division rival penguins' first victory at home . with the devils ( 4 1 3 ) playing their first of 10 sets of back to back games this season , they were left with much to correct and little time to correct it . but they responded by showcasing the discipline and depth they need . we stuck with it , we were patient , devils coach peter###deboer said . even as evgeni###nabokov made one outstanding stop after another for the islanders he finished with 26 saves the devils never yielded to the temptation of adopting a more freewheeling style and beginning to press . even as their top scorers were unable to beat nabokov , they kept the faith that someone else would . that someone turned out to be right wing steve###bernier . his hard work around the net allowed him to rap home a rebound to break the scoreless###tie with a power###play###goal at 06 of the third period while brian strait served a two minute###penalty for charging . it was only the second power###play###goal allowed by the islanders this season . deboer was quick to note his team 's ability to turn away the islanders' explosive###power play , denying them on all seven opportunities . we tightened up defensively , he said . the biggest###difference was the penalty killing . the last game , we were fine five on five . they ate us up with the power play . bernier scored again his third goal of the season 06 after he first solved nabokov . this time , he resorted to guile , banking in a shot off nabokov 's skate . david###clarkson capitalized on an empty net with 22 seconds###left . hedberg , making his second start of the season , repeatedly stood his ground in turning away 17 shots through the first two periods . although the islanders ( 4 3 1 ) managed only five shots in the third period , that is when hedberg , who spends most nights watching martin###brodeur , had to be at his best . i knew nobby was on fire down there he was strong the whole game , hedberg said of nabokov . i kind of felt it would come down to one goal here or there . hedberg made two outstanding stops in the third period . with 06 gone , he denied center john###tavares from point###blank###range and sank to his knees as he held tight to prevent a rebound . just 58 later , hedberg outdid himself . michael###grabner picked off a pass near center ice to create a breakaway . he faked right and veered quickly to his left as he bore down on the goal . hedberg stretched his right leg to the post to make the save . again , there was no second chance . it 's great when he comes in and performs like that , salvador said . you do n't have to worry about these guys in net . they 're going to give you a chance every night . tavares said hedberg was the player who made the difference . he made key saves at key times , he said . stefan matteau , an 18 year old center who is considered a huge part of the devils' future , was a healthy###scratch for the third consecutive###game as the front office continues to assess what is best for his development . if matteau should play a sixth game , it would count as a full year off his entry###level###contract and bring him a year closer to free###agency . general###manager lou###lamoriello has said that contractual considerations will not drive the decision on whether matteau sticks with the devils or is returned to his junior###team .
washington the military judge in the trial of pfc . bradley manning is expected to decide thursday whether to drop a charge accusing private manning of aiding the enemy that could put him in prison for life . civil###liberties advocates said the judge 's decision could set a precedent for whistle###blowers who leak information that gets posted on the internet . the real###danger is that it equates leaks to the press in the public interest with treason against the country , and that is an extremely###dangerous precedent to set , ben wizner , the director of the american###civil###liberties###union 's speech , privacy and technology project , said wednesday . there are dozens of bloggers for the military . this says every single one could be charged with aiding the enemy . in february , private manning , a 25 year old army intelligence###analyst , admitted to having leaked hundreds###of###thousands of classified###documents to wikileaks . he denied that he was guilty of 12 counts , including aiding the enemy , but pleaded###guilty to 10 lesser offenses that could have put him in jail for up to 20 years . the government has said it will not pursue the death###penalty against private manning , but if he is found guilty of the aiding the enemy charge , he faces a life###sentence in military custody with no chance of parole . the decision of the judge , col . denise lind , will center on the prosecution 's evidence that some of the classified###documents private manning admitted giving to wikileaks were posted on the internet and later reached osama###bin###laden . the judge heard a request from the defense on monday to drop the charge . david e . coombs , the lead defense lawyer , argued that private manning did not have actual knowledge that by leaking the documents to wikileaks he was aiding the enemy . in the past , the government had argued that through his extensive###training , private manning should have known that the information could end up with groups that wanted to harm american military###personnel . but the government acknowledged monday that should have known was not enough to define actual knowledge . mr . wizner said that despite the arguments , he does not think actual knowledge is enough to charge private manning with aiding the enemy . there has to be specific###intent , he said .

in quentin###tarantino 's django###unchained , a film whose soundtrack echoes with the wide vista twang of ennio###morricone and some rick###ross thrown in for good measure , one of the most important musical###selections is one we never hear wagner 's ring###cycle . sitting by their campfire one night the two main###characters in the film , which has been nominated for five academy###awards , turn their conversation to the ancient tales on which wagner 's cycle is based . the wife of the black slave django ( jamie###foxx ) is still being held###captive . but he reveals that her childhood masters were german and called her br nnhilde broomhilda von schaft , to be exact , neatly summing up the film 's interweavings of deep myth , cartoonish playfulness and modern blaxploitation . django 's new friend and mentor , the german dentist turned bounty###hunter king schultz ( christoph###waltz , quickly perceives that his quest to rescue broomhilda fits into a larger cultural pattern . after all , there was once another fearless young hero who saved an imprisoned woman called br nnhilde . his name was siegfried . it is a story , schultz says , that every german knows how br nnhilde , having disobeyed her father , the king of the gods , is put into a magic sleep and surrounded by a circle of fire that only the bravest man can penetrate . this is the part of the story that wagner placed at the end of the cycle 's second opera , die###walk###re , and the beginning of the third , siegfried the febrile magic fire music is one of the most frequently###played excerpts from the score . django###unchained refers only to the source of the story in german myth , not explicitly to wagner , who celebrates his 200th birthday on may . bringing up wagner 's ring would be an anachronism . django is set in the late 1850s , before the civil###war and long before the premiere of das###rheingold , the first ring , opera , in munich in , let alone die###walk###re ( munich , 1870 ) and siegfried ( bayreuth , 1876 ) . but mr . tarantino hardly stints on anachronism in this film and in the rest of his body of work . and if a large###public today knows the stories of siegfried and br nnhilde , it is only through wagner 's passionate advocacy . to bring up the ring myths is to bring up the ring . so what is the purpose of having wagner in django ? christopher benfey , on the web###site of the new york review of books , suggests that what may have begun as an attempt to account for schultz 's that is , mr . waltz 's german###accent seems to have spread into the plot , which is also peppered with stock characteristics like beer drinking . the ring story adds a note of the epic to django 's story and prefigures the climactic conflagration . from the 19th century on it was believed that there was something particularly american about the ring myths . the critic henry krehbiel once wrote , as if anticipating mr . tarantino , that americans have not preserved siegfried in the character of a popular hero , as the peoples who occupy our ancestral###homes have done , but we have put his manliness and strength , and even his frank lawlessness , into many of the heroes of our fairy###tales . but it is at least strange that a film about a rebellious slave and his violent rampages through southern plantations takes its mythical backbone from the ring , when wagner 's views on race tended to the vitriolic and reactionary . his shadowy presence in django unavoidably raises , in this birthday year , the ever troubling issue of wagner and race . those views have some ambiguities . wagner acknowledged in his prose writings that even his beloved germans are themselves the product of generations of racial mixing , but he was clear in his belief that the races are irremediably disparate , and he mocked pretensions of equality like those that authorized the blacks in mexico to hold themselves for whites . though wagner , who died in , was not around to see his music embraced by the nazis , the operas are not exempt from the dark currents of his personal###beliefs , including the ring and die###meistersinger von n rnberg , with their depictions of sniveling , vindictive characters seemingly modeled on jews .
mcneese###state was about to play a bigger team from a bigger division in a bigger stadium , but coach matt viator wanted to make sure that his players were not overwhelmed by the stage . so on friday , the day before mcneese###state opened its season against south###florida , viator had his team tour raymond###james###stadium . south###florida shares the stadium with the tampa###bay###buccaneers , and some players had their photographs taken aboard the enormous replica pirate ship that sits near one of the end###zones . others were transfixed by the visitors' locker###room , which had been used that week by the washington###redskins . their name cards were still affixed to the stalls . yet any concerns that viator might have had evaporated early in mcneese###state 's 53 21 victory over south###florida , an evisceration so thorough that it was hailed as one of the most notable upsets of the weekend , though perhaps not the most surprising . in that regard , the cowboys had plenty of competition . mcneese###state , a member of the football###championship###subdivision , was part of a much larger trend on college###football 's opening###weekend . eight teams from the f.c.s. , formerly known as division###i###aa , posted victories over well known opponents from the football###bowl###subdivision , the sport 's top tier . there are a lot of good players to go###around , viator said monday in a telephone interview . i did n't foresee what happened the other night by any stretch of the imagination . but you at least felt going in like we could compete . if you do the things you 're supposed to do , you have a chance . it was a huge weekend for the little guys . north###dakota###state beat kansas###state , 24 21 . northern###iowa topped iowa###state , 28 20 . eastern###washington edged no . 25 oregon###state in a high scoring affair , 49 46 the first win for an f.c.s . team over a ranked f.b.s . team since . there were others , including eastern###illinois over san###diego###state , 40 19 , and towson over connecticut , 33 18 . it should be noted that northern###iowa , like north###dakota###state , is a member of the missouri###valley###football###conference . to put it mildly , the m.v.f.c . is feeling pretty good about itself these days . i think it 's an indication that there 's some good football being played at the f.c.s . level , said craig bohl , the coach at north###dakota###state . on the richter###scale of college###football upsets , north###dakota###state 's win was larger than a tremor but not exactly an earthquake . the bison went 14 1 last season , won a second straight f.c.s . national###title and returned most of their top players , including the senior quarterback brock jensen . there was a reason , bohl said , that the programming gurus at fox###sports , the fledgling sports cable network , chose to broadcast the game in prime time . on saturday , bohl received a congratulatory phone call from tom###osborne , a longtime###coach at nebraska . bohl was an assistant under osborne , and osborne reminded him just how difficult it had been for nebraska a big 12 conference goliath that is now in the big ten to win games at kansas###state . the exposure we 're getting from this is certainly an exponential factor , said bohl , who is in his 11th season at north###dakota###state . we 're beginning to recruit nationally , and a lot of our recruits either watched the game or saw highlights . i think it does change how we 're perceived . it also threw into sharp relief the issue of whether f.b.s . colleges will continue to schedule games against f.c.s . opponents . the big ten has been pushing an initiative to ban its member programs from doing so . a big part of the rationale appears to be that the matchups are bad for television ( many games are blowouts , and television , of course , wields an enormous amount of power over college###football . at the same time , perhaps the emergence of programs like north###dakota###state will play a role in making f.b.s . programs more reluctant to schedule f.c.s . opponents in the future . north###dakota###state may be the top team in the f.c.s. , but kansas###state was still expected to beat the bison handily . it was , in the parlance of sports , a no###win###situation for the wildcats , who not only lost but also had to pay north###dakota###state , 000 for the privilege . bohl said he was optimistic that these interdivisional games would continue . bohl , who is part of the american###football###coaches###association 's board of trustees , cited a recent unanimous###vote by the board in favor of the games . among the coaches who cast###ballots were georgia 's mark###richt and oregon###state 's mike###riley . we think college###football needs to be more inclusive instead of exclusive , bohl said . we think it 's good and it 's healthy for college###football , and there 's a lot more good players at all kinds of different levels . north###dakota###state took a charter flight home in the early###morning###hours after the game and arrived back on campus at 30 a.m . after supplementing their post victory adrenaline with cups of coffee and cans of red###bull , bohl and his staff reconvened at the football headquarters for film review at 8 a.m . it was time for the team to turn its attention to saturday 's opponent , ferris###state . one victory does not a season make , not even a victory over the defending big 12 champion . the beat goes on . just trying to figure out how to win the next game , bohl said .
thousand###oaks , california tournament host tiger###woods expressed bitter###sweet feelings after he lost out in a playoff for the northwestern###mutual world###challenge on sunday as the elite event ended a run of 14 years in california . next december , the world###challenge will shift to isleworth country###club outside orlando in florida , but woods will long treasure memories of his five previous victories here and the 25 million raised by the tournament for his foundation . it is very sad to obviously leave sherwood ( country###club ) because there are so many great memories for me personally , world number one woods told###reporters after being beaten at the first extra###hole by fellow american zach###johnson . this was the last time my dad ( earl ) ever got a chance to watch me play live , and this event has always had special meaning for my father and me . without this event , we would n't be able to build the learning###center which we did down in orange###county , and over , 000 kids have now gone through our facilities . woods , world###challenge champion in , 2004 , 2006 , 2007 and , had been bidding for his sixth tournament victory of 2013 but was still able to reflect on a highly###successful campaign after being denied by johnson . pretty###damn good year , said woods , who won a season high five times on the pga###tour before being voted player of the year for a record 11th time . five wins , and you know , on some pretty good venues , so i 'm very pleased with the year . though woods failed to add to his career haul of 14 majors , he won five of his first 11 pga###tour events , clinching the farmers###insurance###open , the wgc###cadillac###championship , the arnold###palmer###invitational , the players###championship and the wgc###bridgestone###invitational . woods especially likes the look of the venues for next year 's majors . he has always enjoyed###playing at augusta ( masters , has placed second and third in the last two u.s . opens staged at pinehurst and has previously triumphed at both hoylake ( 2006 british###open ) and valhalla ( 2000 pga###championship . i 've won at every one , except for pinehurst , and i 'm trending in the right way , woods said . i 've finished third , second . you get the picture , right ? so i 'm looking forward to the major championship venues next year . they have set up well for me over the years and i look forward to it . as for his form at sherwood country###club this week , woods was particularly pleased with the success of a new driver he put in his bag while he bemoaned his putting on three of the four days . i drove the ball great this week , he said . i found a nice driver and i 'm very pleased at the changes that i found in that . i think changing the shaft really made a big###difference there . most of the week though , except for friday , i was struggling with my putting , blocking putts . today was a perfect example of that . i blocked a lot of putts and just had a tough time finding my release point . the last hole , you know , being left to right and i just did n't want to block that one , and i did n't . i over released it . woods lipped out with a five footer to bogey the first extra###hole after johnson had safely two putted there for par . putting comes and goes , said woods . it is what it is . you have your good days and bad###days . friday i made everything . and today was just one of those days where i just did n't make a lot .
ardmore , pa . merion###golf###club has a history of crowning notable champions . but in the 2013 united###states open , 13 major winners did not make the cut when the rain delayed second round was completed saturday###morning . the excluded group included ngel###cabrera , a former winner of the event and the runner up at the masters in april , and graeme###mcdowell , another former open###champion who was second last year and considered a favorite heading into this event . some of the other major winners eliminated were not surprises because they have not played well lately ( darren###clarke , jos###mar a olaz###bal , keegan###bradley , michael###campbell , y . e . yang , stewart###cink , lucas###glover and david###toms , but others were significant surprises ( zach###johnson and jim###furyk . neither johnson nor furyk was particularly close to making the cut , which eliminated everyone with a two round score of more than , eight over par . johnson was at 151 and furyk at . johnson said merion 's setup was manipulated , and he criticized the united###states###golf###association . furyk praised merion . i think it 's a testament to a golf course that it does n't have to be , 800 yards to be a great golf course , furyk said . merion will always stand the test of time . another surprising name on the cut list was that of tim###clark , who was near the lead when he shot a par 70 thursday , then a second round . the 2010 british###open champion , louis###oosthuizen , who shot an opening , withdrew citing health###issues . it took about three hours saturday for some in the field to play 2 to 12 holes to complete the second round and establish the cut line .
whether you 're comparing restaurant###menus while sitting in the park or turning on the air###conditioner before getting home , life is becoming increasingly mobile thanks to smartphones and tablets . and with new apps appearing constantly , the possibilities for this kind of connected living could be endless if only the batteries lasted long enough . now , a range of solar technology companies are offering small , portable chargers and accessory cases that provide power on the go . some are on the market already , while others are still in development . a mobile life demands mobile power , said chris abbruzzese , vice###president for marketing at goal zero , which makes a number of solar charging systems , including a kit whose battery can take attachments to become a headlamp , flashlight or fan . we sort of have the motto life does n't###stop why should your gear ? devices incorporating solar###cells or panels into cellphone cases have been available for some time , but it has been a challenge to bring form , function and price to the right levels , analysts say . not only were earlier###models too bulky and expensive to capture the mass###market , they also often took too long to charge , especially in the face of improving battery technology . in general , the market for aftermarket batteries has not been great , because until now , for the most part , battery life has been getting a little bit better , said stephen baker , vice###president for industry analysis at npd###group , which tracks consumer behavior . but neither has the solar###power market been great , which helps###explain the solar push into mobile consumer###electronics in the face of what some see as tough odds . the solar companies are rushing there , and the reason why is because the margins in the conventional markets are really bad , said matt feinstein , an analyst at lux research , which specializes in emerging###technologies . he expressed###skepticism that typical consumers would pay a premium for solar powered gear . i doubt people are going to pay more for a phone because it 's got a solar###cell on the back , he said . a range of chargers , some selling for less than , is becoming widely available through major###retailers like rei , target and radio###shack . some , like the solio bolt or the joos orange , use a stand alone solar charged battery###pack that connects to devices through a usb cable . others , like ascent solar 's enerplex , use solar to charge a protective case , which then can recharge the smartphone . there are signs that the products are beginning to find an audience . goal zero , which offers battery packs that fit in a purse as well as mobile generators that can power a home , says it expects its revenue to double this year to about 60 million . ascent solar says its sales began###taking off after fry 's , an electronics chain based in california , began###carrying enerplex chargers . the companies have come to the mobile charging business in different ways . goal zero , for instance , grew from the humanitarian efforts of robert workman , an entrepreneur active in bringing renewable power to remote parts of the democratic###republic###of###congo . the company uses monocrystalline silicon in its portable panels , which fold into the size of a cd case . because of the collapse in silicon panel manufacturing prices , the company can now offer its products at half to a third of what they would have cost three years###ago , said joe atkin , its chief###executive . for ascent , the path was different . faced with the punishing economics of competing with low cost chinese panel makers , which have put several manufacturers out of business , ascent pulled back last year from its original###plan to develop photovoltaic materials for buildings and solar farms . instead , the company decided to focus on consumer###electronics , where profit###margins are higher and the pressure to produce in high volumes is lower . the company relies on so called thin film products made from a compound known as cigs , or copper###indium###gallium###selenide , which can work on flexible###material rather than the glass generally used to support traditional silicon cells . that makes the material well suited to applications like cellphone cases , executives said . alta devices , based in silicon###valley , is pursuing the electronics business for similar reasons but employs a different technology . alta works out of the sunnyvale offices that once served as headquarters for solyndra , the failed panel manufacturer and poster###child of taxpayer###money lost to risky green energy ventures . alta uses gallium###arsenide , the most efficient solar compound , on flexible backing . although the material is still under development , the company already does business with the military and is pursuing applications in the automotive###market . but a big focus is on prototypes for charging cases for smartphones and tablets . when you really make a meaningful difference in how long the battery lasts or how something gets powered , these can become very high adoption rate markets , said christopher s . norris , alta 's chief###executive . given how many devices need charging , he said , these things begin to become billion###dollar markets in a very short amount of time .

the old guy still has it . martin###brodeur was superb in goal tuesday###night in a long line of duels with henrik###lundqvist . he robbed ryan###callahan and derek###stepan alone in front , headed away a batted shot from chris###kreider , got into a brief slap fight with mats zuccarello and all night long looked like a goalie far younger than his 41 years . he even had the luck of a young###man when a first period goal by kreider was waved off because a whistle had blown . brodeur did not extend his shutout###streak to three games , but he stopped 33 of 35 shots , and dainius###zubrus scored the winning###goal with 2 minutes 55 seconds###left###in###regulation to lift the devils over the rangers , 3 2 , at madison###square###garden . i may not play many more times in this building , brodeur said afterward . it always feels nice to win here . ryan###carter gave the devils the lead at 37 of the second period . marc###staal replied for the rangers 18 seconds later the first goal brodeur had given up in 21 , since a 1 0 loss at philadelphia last thursday . carter scored again , his second goal of the season , after beating carl###hagelin to a loose puck and dribbling it past lundqvist at 13 . but dan girardi made it 2 2 at 18 of the third . overtime loomed until zubrus shoveled in a rebound after a rangers defensive breakdown . lundqvist was briefly shaken up midway through the third period when a shot from carter struck him high in the chest and doubled him over in pain . but he remained in the crease . afterward , lundqvist said he wished he had carter 's soft second goal back , and rangers coach alain###vigneault noted that it should have been a routine save . brodeur , meanwhile , was in a more elegiac mood . he talked about all he has seen and done at the garden 1994 , brian###leetch , brendan###shanahan , mike###richter , the passage of time . that 's the history of the rangers , the character of the guys that you played against , he said . now it 's different . there are a lot of young###guys i do n't know . it was the 38th time brodeur and lundqvist , 31 , faced off in a regular###season###game , renewing hockey 's best and longest###running goaltender rivalry for a ninth and perhaps final###season . to add a touch of frisson to the occasion , it was the first time they met since they took turns sniping at each other in september . these two guys do n't like each other , martin###biron said before the game in his debut as a rangers television analyst . biron ought to know he was lundqvist 's backup for three years before retiring last month . during training###camp , brodeur commented on how the new rules shortening leg pads by two inches might affect some goaltenders more than others . there 's goalies i wo n't name names , but they 're not too far they have different padding that it 's not about protection , brodeur said . lundqvist responded , i know i 'm 'not too far , ' but i do n't know what he 's talking about . their barbed exchange receded into the background when both teams started the season terribly ( the rangers , the devils . lundqvist and brodeur were awful , too . in his first eight games , lundqvist was 2 5 with an . 895 save###percentage brodeur was 1 2 2 in his first five with an . 871 save###percentage . but as their teams revived , so did they . the rangers ( 9 9 ) have won six of eight , and the devils improved to . in five previous###games , lundqvist was 4 1 with a . 949 save###percentage back in the form that won him the vezina###trophy two seasons ago and made him a finalist last season . brodeur has been even better . playing behind the kind of stingy defense that helped him and the devils win three stanley###cups from 1995 to , he is 4 1 in his last five games , with 104 saves in 108 shots , for a . 963 save###percentage . not bad for an old guy . with the victory , brodeur ran his record in head to head matchups with lundqvist to . lundqvist dropped to . the rangers announced that rick###nash will practice with the full team wednesday for the first time since being sidelined by a concussion oct . 8 at san###jose . on tuesday###morning at the garden , nash stickhandled and took shots on goalie cam talbot , the fourth###straight day he skated before practice . nash later told###reporters that he visited the michigan head###trauma specialist dr . jeffrey kutcher within a week of sustaining the concussion and was told no long###term effects were foreseen . the seemingly imminent return of nash , one of the n.h.l .

washington president###obama , expanding his push to curtail severe###penalties in drug cases , on thursday commuted the sentences of eight federal inmates who were convicted of crack###cocaine offenses . each inmate has been imprisoned for at least 15 years , and six were sentenced to life in prison . it was the first time retroactive relief was provided to a group of inmates who would most likely have received significantly###shorter terms if they had been sentenced under current drug laws , sentencing rules and charging policies . most will be released in 120 days . the commutations opened a major new front in the administration 's efforts to curb soaring taxpayer spending on prisons and to help correct what it has portrayed as inequality in the justice system . in a statement , mr . obama said that each of the eight men and women had been sentenced under what is now recognized as an unfair system , including a 100 to 1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses that was significantly###reduced by the fair sentencing act of . if they had been sentenced under the current law , many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society , mr . obama said . instead , because of a disparity in the law that is now recognized as unjust , they remain in prison , separated from their families and their communities , at a cost of millions of taxpayer###dollars each year . the commutations have come during a pendulum swing away from tough mandatory minimum sentencing###laws enacted a generation ago amid the crack###epidemic . the policies fueled an 800 percent increase in the number of prisoners in the united###states . they also carried a racial charge offenses involving crack , which was disproportionately prevalent in impoverished black communities , carried far more severe###penalties than those for powder cocaine , favored by affluent white users . according to families against mandatory minimums , about , 800 federal inmates are serving time for crack offenses committed before congress reduced mandatory###minimum###sentences , going forward , in the 2010 law . the commutation recipients included clarence aaron of mobile , ala . , who was sentenced to three life terms in prison for his role in a 1993 drug deal , when he was . mr . aaron 's case has been taken up by civil###rights groups and congressional critics of severe sentencing for nonviolent drug###offenses , and has received###significant news###media attention . margaret love , his lawyer , said she received a call informing her of the decision on thursday###morning and called her client , who along with his family was very grateful . he was absolutely overcome , ms . love said . actually , i was , too . he was in tears . this has been a long###haul for him , 20 years . he just was speechless , and it 's very exciting . rights###groups like the american###civil###liberties###union , which had profiled several of the recipients in a recent report on nonviolent offenders serving###life###sentences , greeted the announcement with praise and calls for additional efforts . reaction among conservatives , who in states like texas and south###carolina have been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the mass###incarceration of nonviolent offenders , was muted . the top republicans on the house and senate judiciary committees declined to comment . the commutation recipients also included reynolds wintersmith , of rockford , ill . , who was 17 in 1994 when he was sentenced to life in prison for dealing crack , and stephanie george , of pensacola , fla . , who received a life###sentence in , when she was , for hiding a boyfriend 's stash of crack in a box in her house . in both cases , the judges criticized the mandatory sentences they were required to impose , calling them unjust . in december , the new york times published an article about ms . george 's case and the larger rethinking of the social and economic###costs of long###prison###terms for nonviolent offenders . mr . obama mentioned the article in an interview with time magazine that day and said he was considering asking officials about ways to do things smarter . around that time , a senior white###house official said , mr . obama directed kathryn ruemmler , his white###house###counsel , to ask the justice###department to examine pending clemency petitions to assess whether there were any in which current inmates serving long sentences would have benefited from subsequent changes to sentencing###laws and policy . the deputy###attorney###general , james m . cole , who oversees the pardon office , worked on the policy###shift and ultimately returned the eight cases with positive recommendations from the department , the official said . in , there was bipartisan###support in congress for reducing the disparity in sentences between crack and powder cocaine , against a backdrop of crime###rates that have plunged to the lowest###levels in four decades . and in august , attorney###general eric h . holder jr . instructed prosecutors to omit listing any quantities of illicit###substances in indictments for low###level drug###offenses in order to avoid triggering mandatory###minimum###sentences . but those moves have left###unanswered what , if anything , to do about federal inmates serving lengthy sentences for crack offenses committed before the fair sentencing act . a bill co sponsored by senator richard j . durbin , democrat of illinois , and mike###lee , republican of utah , would make the fair sentencing act retroactive for some offenders , allowing inmates to apply to a judge for a review of whether a reduced###sentence would be appropriate . the obama administration supports that bill , the white###house said on thursday , as an orderly way to ensure case by case analysis in addressing the broader problem . in the new year , lawmakers should act on the kinds of bipartisan sentencing reform###measures already working their way through congress , mr . obama said . together , we must ensure that our taxpayer###dollars are spent wisely , and that our justice system keeps its basic promise of equal treatment for all . mr . obama , who has made relatively little use of his constitutional clemency powers to forgive offenses or reduce sentences , also pardoned 13 people who completed their sentences long###ago . those cases involved mostly minor###offenses , in line with his previous pardons .
fargo , n.d . gov . jack###dalrymple of north###dakota approved the nation 's toughest abortion restrictions on tuesday , signing into law a measure that would ban nearly all abortions and inviting a legal showdown over just how much states can limit access to the procedure . mr . dalrymple , a republican , signed three bills passed by the republican###controlled###legislature in bismarck . the most far reaching law forbids abortion once a fetal###heartbeat is detectable , which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy . fetal heartbeats are detectable at that stage of pregnancy using a transvaginal ultrasound . most legal###scholars have said the law would violate the supreme###court 's finding in roe v . wade that abortions were permitted until the fetus was viable outside the womb , generally around 24 weeks . even some leaders of the anti abortion movement nationally have predicted that laws###banning abortion so early in pregnancy are virtually certain to be declared###unconstitutional by federal###courts . although the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question , this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of roe v . wade , mr . dalrymple said in a statement . the supreme###court , he added , has never considered this precise restriction in the heartbeat bill . i think there 's a lot of frustration in the pro###life movement , said paul b . linton , a constitutional###lawyer in illinois who was formerly general###counsel of americans###united###for###life . forty years after roe v . wade was decided , it 's still the law of the land . the new laws place north###dakota , for the moment at least , at the center of sharp efforts in several republican controlled states to curb abortion rights . three weeks###ago , arkansas lawmakers adopted what at the time was the country 's most stringent abortion limit , also tied to detection of a fetal###heartbeat and banning the procedure at 12 weeks of pregnancy . that is the point at which a heartbeat can be detected using an abdominal ultrasound . the arkansas and north###dakota laws have offered the first victories for an emerging faction of the anti abortion movement that is frustrated by the limited progress in curbing abortions and hopes that the supreme###court might be ready for a radical rethinking . but that approach has caused divisions within the movement , with mr . linton and others calling it wishful thinkingthe north###dakota fetal###heartbeat law and others like it , mr . linton said , have no chance in the courts . abortion rights###advocates who had gathered here to urge the governor to veto the bills quickly condemned his decision as effectively banning abortion in the state and as an attack on women . without judicial intervention , the three bills are scheduled to take effect aug . 1 . in the past it 's been , 'we 're going to try and make it more difficult , more hoops , more obstacles for women to have to jump through or jump over , ' said tammi kromenaker , the director of red river women 's clinic in fargo , the state 's only abortion provider . but this is specifically 'let 's ban abortion . let 's do it . let 's challenge roe v . wade . let 's end abortion in north###dakota . ' the center for reproductive###rights , in new york , immediately condemned the new laws and said it would file a challenge to the fetal###heartbeat ban . mr . dalrymple also affirmed a law to require doctors performing###abortions to get admitting privileges at a local hospital , which could force the closing of the red river clinic . a similar law adopted by mississippi last year is under challenge in federal court . he also signed a third law that would prevent abortion in cases of gender preference or the first of its kind in the nation genetic###defects , like down syndrome . the signings come on top of a resolution approved by the north###dakota legislature last week to amend the state constitution to assert that life begins at conception , a move that would give a fetus the rights of a person and outlaw virtually all abortions . the so called personhood measure , asserting that the inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and defended , will go on the ballot next year . such measures have been voted down in mississippi and colorado . mr . dalrymple acted on the measures less than 24 hours after they were advanced to his desk . similar###measures to ban abortions when fetal heartbeats are detected are under consideration in several other states , including kansas and ohio .
houston three years after its disastrous oil###rig accident in the gulf of mexico , bp has managed to strengthen its finances by divesting itself of less profitable operations , ramping up new oil###production in the north###sea and angola and reducing its exposure to volatile investments in russia . but one wild###card continues to menace the company bp 's bill to compensate thousands of gulf spill claimants is spiraling beyond what it expected and could take billions###of###dollars out of its future###earnings . in an effort to limit its exposure , bp has told a federal###appeals###court that a claims administrator misinterpreted the terms of a multibillion###dollar settlement reached last year arising out of the 2010 deepwater###horizon rig explosion and oil###spill that took 11 lives and soiled gulf beaches . a decision by the court of appeals for the fifth circuit in new orleans is expected within the next few weeks . according to bp , many businesses are securing settlements for exaggerated or even fictitious losses . irreparable injustices are taking###place , theodore b . olson , the former solicitor###general , who is representing bp , told the appeals###court on monday . he warned of a hemorrhaging of possibly billions###of###dollars because of the administrator 's miscalculation of business losses following the spill . the plaintiffs' lawyers dispute the claim , saying that bp is trying to back away from a settlement it negotiated , co wrote and agreed to . bp has taken a charge of . 2 billion for cleanup###costs , fines and other compensation . it initially estimated that it would pay . 8 billion to gulf###coast businesses and residents , a total it has increased to . 2 billion excluding future business loss claims that the company says it cannot yet estimate . there is no cap to the settlements . the claims continue to rise while awards have been significantly###higher than the company had expected . the administrator can accept new claims until next april . nearly 4 billion has been paid out so far on more than , 000 eligible claims . estimates of how much bp may have to pay out to businesses range widely , but it could easily top the . 7 billion the company still has in a reserve by hundreds of millions if not billions###of###dollars . at the same time , bp faces another significant###potential liability . billions###of###dollars in fines under the clean###water###act still hang in the balance in judge carl barbier 's new orleans federal courtroom , depending on whether he decides bp , along with its contractors halliburton and transocean , engaged in gross###negligence or willful misconduct before the calamitous rig explosion . the second phase of the civil###trial , starting in september , will determine how much oil actually spilled . if bp is found to be grossly negligent and receives a maximum fine under the federal clean###water###act , the company could face as much as 14 billion in penalties depending on how much oil flooded into the gulf and how much blame is apportioned to bp and the contractors , according to stephen simko , a senior morningstar analyst . bp last year agreed###to###plead###guilty to 14 criminal counts and will pay 4 billion over five years in a settlement with the justice###department . two company well site supervisors who were aboard the deepwater###horizon and a former vice###president of exploration in the gulf also face trials on an assortment of criminal###charges . but oil company analysts are optimistic that a company that appeared to be in mortal###danger in the months after the accident can now bear the financial###burdens unless oil###prices fall considerably albeit as a company that is much reduced in size from the one before the accident . it will cost them more money but bp can afford it , said fadel gheit , managing###director of oil and gas research at oppenheimer company . even with this accident , bp remains the world leader in deepwater drilling . they have an offshore india gas position that could significantly boost its market value over the years , and before you know it the company will be one of the foremost explorers in the arctic . bp has proved to be a formidable moneymaking machine capable of weathering the storm . between 2010 and , bp conducted something of a garage###sale of oil and gas fields that its leaders considered superfluous , pulling in about 38 billion , only a few billion###dollars short of what it has estimated that it will pay out in gulf spill damages . as of last march the company had about 28 billion in cash , and it has resumed paying###dividends .

wimbledon , england going into laura###robson 's first round###match against 10th seeded maria###kirilenko on tuesday , british tennis players not named andy###murray had won all of one set in seven matches at wimbledon . robson , britain 's top ranked woman at no . 38 , was handed a difficult opponent to start , but as her countrymen and countrywomen continued to lose , she also walked onto court no . 1 with the annual hand wringing over the state of british tennis already well under way . robson rose to the occasion , giving the british fans a reason to rise to their feet . with her booming left handed serve , she took control of the match with a break in the eighth game of the first set and kept kirilenko off balance the rest of the way for a , 6 4 victory . it was a big one for me because although i really like grass and i seem to play well on it , i 've never actually done overly well here , said robson , 19 . i 've only made the second round once . she added i thought i could win . i did n't###expect to win . kirilenko , whose fianc alex ovechkin credited her with helping him win the hart###trophy as the n.h.l . 's most valuable###player , broke into the top 10 this year after reaching the quarterfinals at the french###open . she also was a quarterfinalist at wimbledon last year . but robson used 8 aces and 31 winners to overpower kirilenko . a former wimbledon junior###champion who won a silver###medal with murray in mixed###doubles at the olympics , robson broke through at the united###states open last year , beating li###na and kim###clijsters on her way to the fourth###round . at such a young###age , robson has faced many big moments . but after going up two breaks in the second set , she played a loose game and was broken for . the crowd , perhaps used to disappointment , seemed restless and tense . robson said she was nervous , too , but she was able to serve out the match . in the past i 've started out well in the first couple of games of the first set and then just not been able to hold on to that lead , she said . i 've been really happy with my progress in the last couple of months with that and just being able to tough out wins . a day after the shocking upset of rafael###nadal on the same court , robson 's victory caused the biggest ripple at the all england club . serena###williams , playing her first grass###court match since last year 's olympics , opened on centre court with a , 6 3 victory over mandy###minella of luxembourg . the biggest###surprise of that match was williams 's serve being broken early in the second set . top seeded novak###djokovic had heaped###praise on the grass###court abilities of his first round opponent , florian###mayer , but djokovic was through to the second round easily , 6 3 , 7 5 , 6 4 . david###ferrer , whose no . 4 seeding over nadal was the subject of much discussion , dropped a set , but advanced with a , 4 6 , 7 5 , 6 2 victory over martin alund . getting back to normal at wimbledon meant worrying about british tennis . as the home###fans relish murray 's best chance to break the british drought here , poor overall results perpetuate concerns about the lawn###tennis###association , the national###governing###body of the sport . an independent chairman , david gregson , was appointed in december and is conducting a review of the organization . the chief###executive , roger draper , announced his resignation in march , and his replacement has not yet been chosen . sport###england , which distributes taxpayer###money for sports , has withheld millions of pounds and reduced overall funding to the l.t.a . because it has failed to meet participation goals . murray is the only british player in the men 's top . there are two british women , robson and heather###watson , in the top , compared with 10 americans . that situation was lampooned by owen slot , a reporter for the times of london , in an essay in the wall###street###journal before the tournament , which called on the united###states to please stop developing these young###women tennis players . or send us your off cuts . because wimbledon is humiliating for the home###team . fans could watch that story###line play out tuesday on court , where watson faced the up and coming 18 year old american madison keys . in the stands to see the 56th ranked watson was judy murray , andy 's mother and the british fed###cup coach , and iain bates , the women 's tennis team manager of the l.t.a . the 52nd ranked keys is a prized pupil of the united###states###tennis###association , based at the training facility at boca###raton , fla . watson missed two months because of mononucleosis , returning recently for the french###open and the grass###court season . she said that her game and her fitness were not 100 percent and that her reaction times were slow . watson 's lack of rhythm was apparent in the first set of keys 's , 7 5 victory . although it was keys 's first main draw match at wimbledon , her game seemed well suited to grass , particularly her serve , which averaged 107 miles an hour . at the end of the first round , robson was the only british woman left . neither she nor watson got very far in postmatch news conferences before being asked about the state of british tennis . watson noted the depth in the lower ranks , with johanna###konta and tara###moore in the top 200 and rising . katy dunn was a top 10 junior###player . i feel like it is coming up slowly , but it 's getting there , watson said . robson said that even though it was especially disappointing for british players to lose at wimbledon , they were producing good results week in and week out . before this week , everyone was playing really well , she said . so it 's unfortunate that no one else made the second round . of the 14 american women in the tournament , just five remain , including the 126th ranked wild###card alison###riske , who upset the no . 31 seed , romina###oprandi . but at least american tennis is considered on the rise . it seems like countries usually come up together , keys said . so it 's great that this is kind of our time now . tuesday was robson 's time . she will play the qualifier mariana###duque marino of colombia in the second round , and anticipation is high for a long run . on the bbc telecast after robson 's match , virginia###wade , the last british woman to win a major , giddily imagined what was next for robson , even suggesting a quarterfinal meeting with williams , causing the studio###host sue###barker to say , calm down , virginia . virginia always gets quite excited , does n't she ? robson said when told of wade 's comments . i 'd love to win a couple more matches . but i do n't want to get ahead of myself .
washington president###obama 's nomination on friday of jeh c . johnson as the next secretary###of###homeland###security reignited criticism of the department and led republicans and democrats to blame one another for its problems . still , mr . johnson does not appear to face major obstacles for confirmation by the democratic controlled###senate . senator thomas r . carper , democrat of delaware , the chairman of the homeland###security###committee , praised mr . obama 's choice , saying mr . johnson was nominated at a critical time for the agency and its mission . the post has been open since the previous secretary , janet###napolitano , resigned in july to lead the university of california system , and confirmation of the nominee for deputy###secretary of the department is stalled in the senate . mr . obama , in a rose garden ceremony , spoke of his personal###bond with mr . johnson , calling him an outstanding public###servant who i have known and trusted for years , and he urged the senate to confirm mr . johnson as soon as possible . mr . johnson , 56 , has been a fund###raiser for mr . obama and was a legal###adviser during his first presidential###campaign . weeks after taking###office , mr . obama nominated mr . johnson to be the defense###department 's general###counsel . most recently , mr . johnson has practiced###law with paul , weiss , rifkind , wharton###garrison . earlier in his career , he was a federal###prosecutor in new york . in accepting the nomination , mr . johnson noted that he was in manhattan on sept . 11 , 2001 . i wandered the streets of new york that day and wondered and asked , what can i do ? he said . he does not have the border###security credentials that ms . napolitano brought to the job as a former governor of arizona . but mr . johnson whose first name is pronounced jay has been a central player in mr . obama 's efforts to redefine the war on terrorism . mr . obama cited those credentials , saying that mr . johnson had a deep understanding of the threats and challenges facing the united###states . some republican###senators criticized mr . johnson for his lack of expertise in immigration and border###security . rather than selecting someone who knows the unique dynamics of our southern###border , president###obama has tapped one of his former new york fund###raisers , senator john###cornyn of texas said in a statement . we need someone who knows how to secure the border , not dial for dollars . the nomination reopened partisan sniping about the effectiveness of the department###of###homeland###security and criticism of the number of vacancies at the top . republicans said the department whose agencies include the transportation###security###administration has long been one of the most mismanaged in government . some of the sharpest criticism came from representative michael###mccaul , republican of texas , who said that over 40 percent of senior###leadership###positions at d.h.s . are either vacant or have an 'acting' placeholder . the lack of leadership at the white###house is reflected in the holes in leadership at the department , and these important###positions must be filled in order to fill the holes in our homeland###security , said mr . mccaul , who is the chairman of the house homeland###security###committee . but democrats blamed republicans for shackling the department by standing in the way of president###obama 's nominations . administration officials said that of the 18 positions at the department###of###homeland###security that require senate approval , 7 are held by acting appointees . president###obama has announced nominees for four of those jobs , and officials said nominations for the others would come soon . one of the nominations in limbo is for deputy###secretary . the nominee , alejandro mayorkas , now the director of citizenship and immigration services , would help mr . johnson get up to speed on immigration as congress begins to tackle the issue this fall . mr . mayorkas 's nomination is stalled because of an inspector###general 's investigation . at issue is whether mr . mayorkas intervened inappropriately to allow an electric###car company , greentech automotive , to receive visas for investors . mr . mayorkas has strongly###denied the accusations , and mr . carper , along with several former senior officials in the bush###administration , supports his nomination . but the top republican on the homeland###security###committee , senator tom###coburn of oklahoma , has sought to hold it up until the inspector###general 's report is filed . at the immigration agency , mr . mayorkas helped###devise and carry out the program that deferred deportations for young unauthorized immigrants . the director 's job at another crucial homeland###security agency , immigration and customs enforcement , has been temporarily filled t by john sandweg , who was a top legal###adviser to ms . napolitano . the nomination of gil###kerlikowske to head customs###and###border###protection also awaits senate###confirmation . mr . johnson will also have to contend with dissent among department employees whose unions have openly###criticized mr . obama 's immigration enforcement policies .
brussels the european###union may soon have a new budget including the first cut to spending in its history after a surprise breakthrough deal on thursday . the european###commission president , jos###manuel###barroso , announced agreement on a seven year , 960 billion###euro , or . 27 trillion , budget after early###morning talks with the president of the european###parliament and other officials from e.u . member states . mr . barroso said the deal included more flexibility than earlier###versions . the budget still needs final###approval by the european###parliament , but that is looking more likely thanks to this agreement . the european###parliament president , martin###schulz , called the deal acceptable and said he was optimistic that he would have a majority of parliament members backing it at a vote next week . the budget includes the first cut to spending in european###union history at a time when many of the bloc 's countries are in recession and struggling to reduce their national###debt . the budget sets what the bloc of nations can spend on programs ranging from infrastructure and farming to development###aid and employment measures . the 27 european###union countries have been trying since last autumn to cobble together a budget for the years . the talks were difficult because some countries wanted to increase or maintain spending levels while others insisted it made no sense to increase the budget while individual governments were imposing tough austerity policies . e.u . leaders agreed to an overall package in february , but the european###parliament asked for more spending and more say in the way the budget would be handled . ireland 's prime###minister , enda###kenny , championed the latest agreement . ireland had been hoping to crown its six month presidency of the european###union , which ends sunday , with a comprehensive budget agreement . i think it is very significant , mr . kenny told###reporters in brussels alongside mr . barroso and mr . schulz . noting that there was a lot of doubt at the beginning of the year about whether compromise could be negotiated between the e.u . member states and parliament , he added , we have now succeeded in doing that . separate from national spending , the budget is designed in part to balance out the economic###development of its members by giving funding to poorer###countries . the european###union has funded thousands of infrastructure and capital projects over the years , from the installation of broadband networks to the upgrade of road networks . the budget also includes items meant to generate economic###growth , like research and development and a new , more accurate satellite###navigation system . it also funds regulation and administration in such areas as mergers and competition , the review of national budgets to ensure they do not include excessive deficits , and banking###supervision . if the european###union fails to get a seven year deal passed by parliament before the end of the year , the bloc would have to revert to annual budgets , which would make long###term###planning difficult .
i admit it . i do n't know much about modern###dance , or postmodern###dance , for that matter . i like it when i see it though i do n't see it often . when i try to read about it , i can barely decipher all that windy talk of space and weight and freedom . say what ? but when i saw that the trisha###brown dance company would be at the brooklyn###academy###of###music next week with a program that includes the new york premieres of ms . brown 's two final works , i found myself curious . not so much about ms . brown , 76 , and her storied career . i mean yes , brava , job well done . but who , i wondered , is the newest person in the company ? the one with the least experience , performing the last dances of a pioneer , for whom the stakes are highest ? among the male###dancers , that turned out to be stuart shugg , a 25 year old australian whose life story bears more than a passing resemblance to that of billy###elliot . the billy of stage and screen , son of a british###coal miner , has a passion and aptitude for ballet that propel him out of his small###town and into the royal###ballet for mr . shugg , who joined the company in late , the passion was and is modern###dance . to watch him is riveting , but to hear him tell his story was , for me at least , even better . we dispensed with his stage###fright first . it 's tough being the newest dancer because you 're the one being consistently taught , he said . there 's a huge amount of material to remember , and i 've###spent countless###hours in studios by myself , practicing and recording . i 'm learning the final###version of the new dances since i do n't know how they got there . i 've gone back through the building tapes to see , 'look , this is how they fell out of that lift , and that 's how this next movement came about . ' those bodies spent a long time with trisha###brown , developing that particular vocabulary . i 'm trying to live up to what i consider their legends . also , i am nervous to be in new york , having those eyes on you . the company 's history is here . we were talking in an empty room at the academy , where mr . shugg had just finished seven hours rehearsing . even in that last hour , his control and concentration were pure and complete . as he held a pose , still as a statue , the only thing that betrayed his monumental effort was the bottom of his wildly shaking t###shirt . his blue###eyes , beneath his brooke###shields eyebrows , were rimmed red with fatigue , and his face reddened too when he spoke about his background and the inevitable billy###elliot comparison . i feel so silly , he said of his childhood in red###cliffs , a country town outside of mildura , a small city in the southeastern state of victoria , 6 hours' drive from melbourne , 11 from sydney . his father , a carpenter , was raised there his mother is a nurse . it is so often the clich story , but i remember holding my mom 's hand in the supermarket aisles , prancing around , not being able to stop moving , he said , smiling . we found a jazz###dance class run by one of the local moms , just basic jazz moves . something to do in a bored town . he also choreographed his own dances , set to the back street boys , which his class performed for the state premier . with the rest of his kinetic###energy , he played###cricket .

atlanta the nets did not move . that is how pure their jumpers were . in they went , again and again , from 21 feet and beyond , shot by a michigan freshman named spike and a louisville junior named luke . no one dared miss , and neither did . it was the highest stakes game of horse they had ever played on the raised court of the georgia###dome , a national###championship the prize and , perhaps , the unlikeliest one , too . before monday###night , spike albrecht was known , in the words of his coach , for being the most eligible###bachelor on the michigan campus . he does not start . before this weekend , luke hancock was known for rushing to teammate###kevin ware 's aid and kneeling beside him . he does not start , either . but he can shoot , and every 3 pointer that spun off his hands before halftime dropped through the hoop . there were four of them , and then his fifth , with about three minutes remaining , secured###victory for louisville , title for louisville . it extended the cardinals' lead to , and they eventually###won , 82 76 , to capture their first championship since . with three minutes left in the first half , albrecht had four 3 pointers and hancock none . fans around the nation scurried to their favorite internet search###engine to learn more about a player who began monday averaging . 8 points and ended it trending on twitter . it was all albrecht , all the time , but then , with louisville trailing , hancock got open , over and over . when his staccato bursts subsided , louisville trailed , 36 35 . the shooting display par###excellence mesmerized their teammates and the boisterous crowd . albrecht pumped his fist and gestured to the crowd . hancock put his fingers to his head as he backpedaled upcourt . in 20 minutes' time , the tournament of russdiculous and trey the louisville guard russ smith and michigan guard trey###burke , the national player of the year had morphed into a stage for albrecht and hancock . a few years apart , they followed similar career###paths . overlooked out of high###school , each spent a year at a prep###school to gain visibility , albrecht in massachusetts and hancock in virginia , where he landed at george###mason . after transferring when the coach , jim larranaga , left for miami , hancock sat out last season for the cardinals , had shoulder###surgery and emerged as a critical sixth###man . as soon as we started###playing luke hancock more , coach rick###pitino said , our halfcourt offense evolved into something special . this has been a particularly emotional three weeks for hancock , whose father , bill , is ill with an undisclosed ailment , as reported by yahoo###sports . he did not attend the cardinals' first four games , but he and his wife , van , reportedly drove here from their home in roanoke , va . after pouring in 20 points off the bench saturday###night against wichita###state , hancock thanked pitino for the opportunity . after leading the cardinals with 22 points on monday###night , hancock reflected . it 's hard to put into words , he said . i 'm so excited that he was here . it just means a lot . bill hancock was present to watch his son become the first nonstarter to be named the most outstanding###player at the final four since at least . when the moderator at the postgame news conference made that announcement , hancock , walking off the dais , just nodded . the emotion , he showed that earlier . as smith strode to the foul###line with two seconds###left , with louisville up by 6 points , hancock hopped around midcourt and flexed , looking toward the crowd , before giving a flying shoulder bump to peyton###siva . hancock bettered his performance from the other day , finishing with 22 points , scoring 6 after halftime , helping the cardinals build their lead . that is where he differed from albrecht , who scored all 17 of his points in an absurdly efficient 12 minute spurt . fortunately , i was hitting shots , said albrecht , who appeared dazed afterward , his eyes red . he logged 28 minutes , by far a career best . teammates were finding me . plagued by foul problems , burke spent the final 09 of the first half on the bench . in his absence , albrecht made 3 pointers from the corner and the wing and the top of the arc , and a ridiculous floater and a driving layup . in massachusetts , his former coach at northfield mount###hermon , john###carroll , took it all in . this is crazy , he said in a text###message .
bellevue , wash . in a drab one story###building here , set between an indoor###tennis club and a home###appliance showroom , dozens of engineers , physicists and nuclear experts are chasing a radical dream of bill gates . the quest is for a new kind of nuclear###reactor that would be fueled by today 's nuclear###waste , supply all the electricity in the united###states for the next 800 years and , possibly , cut the risk of nuclear###weapons proliferation around the world . the people developing the reactor work for a start up , terrapower , led by mr . gates and a fellow microsoft billionaire , nathan###myhrvold . so far , it has raised tens###of###millions of dollars for the project , but building a prototype reactor could cost 5 billion a reason mr . gates is looking for a home for the demonstration###plant in rich and energy hungry china . the hope is that we 'll find a country , with china being the most likely , that would be able to build the demo plant , mr . gates said last year in a conversation with the energy expert daniel###yergin . if that happens , then the economics of this are quite a bit better than the plants we have today . perhaps one of the most intriguing arguments supporters make about mr . gates 's reactor is that it could eliminate several routes to weapons###proliferation . iran , for example , says its nuclear###program is for peaceful###purposes , but it is enriching far more uranium than it needs for power###generation . the united###states has long said that iran 's enrichment could lead to a nuclear###bomb . today 's nuclear###reactors run on concentrations of 3 to 5 percent uranium , an enriched fuel that leaves behind a pure , mostly natural waste , uranium . ( a uranium bomb runs on more than 90 percent uranium . ) in today 's reactors , some uranium 238 is converted to plutonium that is used as a small , supplemental fuel , but most of the plutonium is left behind as waste . in contrast , the terrapower reactor makes more plutonium from the uranium 238 for use as fuel , and so would run almost entirely on uranium . it would need only a small amount of uranium , which would function like lighter fluid getting a charcoal barbecue started . the result , terrapower 's supporters hope , is that countries would not need to enrich uranium in the quantities they do now , undercutting arguments that they have to have vast stores on hand for a civilian program . terrapower 's concept would also blunt the logic behind a second route to a bomb recovering plutonium from spent reactor fuel , which is how most nuclear###weapons are built . since so much uranium 238 is available , there would be no reason to use that plutonium , terrapower says . countries that do not have nuclear###weapons will still need lots of electricity , said john gilleland , chief###executive of terrapower , and we would like to see them build something that allows us to sleep at night . but no one disputes that this is a very long###term bet . even optimists say it would take until at least 2030 to commercialize the technology . what the competition would look like then wind , solar , natural###gas or some other technology is not clear . if the idea can be commercialized , it is not even clear that terrapower could do it first . the engineers working for mr . gates acknowledge the enormous challenges but say they are convinced that he , and they , are chasing the solution not only to energy and weapons###proliferation but also to climate###change and poverty . if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce###poverty by far you would pick energy , mr . gates said as he introduced the reactor idea in a speech in . energy and climate are extremely###important to these people , in fact , more important to them than anyone else on the planet , he added , referring to killer floods , droughts and crop###failures driven by carbon###dioxide given off in energy production . he illustrated his talk with a photo of schoolchildren doing their homework under street###lamps . doug adkisson , terrapower 's senior###vice###president for operations , said mr . gates had a very humanitarian but very cold assessment about nuclear###power and what it could do . what drives him to nuclear###power , he said , are the questions what have you got , and what can you do to raise the living standard of a whole lot of people ? despite its difficulties , some outside experts applaud mr . gates for trying .
phoenix the phoenix###suns and michael###beasley have reached an agreement to terminate the contract of the troubled forward . the move on tuesday will cost the franchise 7 million , a 2 million savings from what beasley would have been due had he simply been waived . it also represents a significant reduction in what the hit on the team 's salary###cap would have been . beasley was arrested a month ago in suburban scottsdale on charges of felony marijuana###possession and possession of drug###paraphernalia . it was the latest in a series of incidents involving the drug that have plagued his nba career after he was selected as the no . 2 overall draft###pick out of kansas###state in . the suns were devoted to michael###beasley 's success in phoenix , suns president for basketball operations lon babby said in a statement released by the team . however , it is essential that we demand the highest###standards of personal and professional conduct as we develop a championship culture . today 's action reflects our commitment to those standards . the suns took a chance on beasley despite his history of off the court problems . in june , beasley was ticketed for marijuana###possession and speeding in a minneapolis suburb . he has acknowledged that while he was with the miami###heat , he twice violated the nba 's drug policy and entered a treatment###facility in . but at the news conference announcing his signing of a three year , 18 million contract with phoenix , beasley vowed that his marijuana days were over . i realize 10 minutes of feeling good is not really worth putting my life and my career and my legacy in jeopardy , he said then , so i 'm confident to say that that part of my career , that part of my life , is over and wo n't be coming back . but early on aug . 6 , his mercedes was pulled over for a traffic###stop and a scottsdale officer said he smelled marijuana . police said they found three marijuana cigarettes in the car beasley was driving . lance blanks was suns general###manager when beasley was signed and enthusiastically supported the acquisition . blanks was fired at the end of last season and replaced by ryan mcdonough , who hired new coach jeff###hornacek and has overseen a wholesale change in the roster after the suns compiled the worst###record in the western conference and second worst in franchise###history . we have high###standards for all of our players , mcdonough said . we expect them to represent the team and the community in a positive manner both on and off the court . on the court , beasley 's one season with the suns was a disappointing one . he averaged career###lows of . 1 points and . 8 rebounds in 75 games while shooting a career worst . 5 percent from the field . beasley 's agent , jeff schwartz , did not respond to email or phone requests for comment . beasley , 24 , has played five seasons in the nba , two with miami , two with minnesota and one with phoenix . he is averaging . 1 points per game for his career . the suns' recent trade of caron###butler to milwaukee created 6 million in salary###cap room to soften the financial blow to the suns . the timing and nature of this , and all our transactions , babby said , are based on the judgment of our basketball leadership as to how best to achieve our singular goal of rebuilding an elite###team .
led by center al###horford 's 23 points , the atlanta###hawks continued their high scoring ways in a 118 85 victory over the utah###jazz , extending their winning###streak to three games . horford , a sixth year veteran from florida , made 11 of 15 shots from the field in only 23 minutes . he added four rebounds and one assist and did not play in the fourth###quarter . horford is averaging . 6 points and . 2 rebounds in the last five games ( four wins . in the last four games , the hawks ( 15 12 ) are averaging . 5 points and have reached 100 in their last 10 games . atlanta improved to 5 1 at philips###arena against western conference teams . forward chris###bosh scored 25 points to lead the miami###heat to 122 103 victory over the sacramento###kings at americanairlines arena , the third time in four games that bosh has scored more than 20 points . heat forward lebron###james had 18 points , six rebounds and eight assists . heat guard dwyane###wade had 20 points , his fourth###straight game with at least that many points . it was also a season high in points for the heat . forward demarcus###cousins led the kings with 27 points , eight rebounds and five assists . the kings lost despite shooting 58 percent from the floor . point###guard kemba###walker scored a season high 34 points and the charlotte###bobcats outscored the detroit###pistons 41 17 in the fourth###quarter for a 116 106 victory at the palace . center al###jefferson scored 15 of his 24 points in the fourth and grabbed 14 rebounds . shooting###guard gerald###henderson contributed 22 points and eight rebounds for the bobcats , who trailed by as much as 20 points . point###guard brandon###jennings led the pistons ( 13 15 ) with 26 points and forward josh###smith added 18 points and six rebounds . forward evan###turner coaxed in a layup at the overtime buzzer as the philadelphia 76ers beat the brooklyn###nets 121 120 to snap a seven game losing###streak . turner , who collected 29 points and 10 rebounds , took a handoff from center spencer###hawes at the top of the circle and drove the left side of the lane before firing from close###range while surrounded by defenders . the ball danced on the rim before dropping through . forward thaddeus###young added 25 points for the sixers , who on monday had been drubbed 130 94 by the nets in brooklyn , behind guard joe###johnson 's 37 point explosion .
berlin schalke 04 carried some of their champions###league momentum into the bundesliga on sunday , beating freiburg 2 0 to bounce back after a string of erratic results . nicolas hoefler stabbed the ball into his own net on the stroke of halftime to put the hosts into a lucky lead and jefferson farfan converted a penalty to lift schalke to sixth###place with 27 points . second placed bayer###leverkusen , who also advanced to the champions###league round of , slumped to a 1 0 home###defeat by lowly eintracht###frankfurt in the other game on sunday to end their four match###winning###streak . marco russ headed in on the hour and despite joselu 's saved stoppage time penalty , frankfurt ended their run of 10 games without a win to leave leverkusen on 37 points , seven behind leaders bayern###munich , who beat hamburg sv 3 1 on saturday . with only one win in their previous three league###games , schalke coach jens keller had been under pressure but got a welcome boost in midweek when they beat basel to advance in the champions###league . sunday 's win may have lacked the shine and aggression of their european performance but certainly further improved his chances of staying on past the winter###break . keller can also again count on central defender kyriakos###papadopoulos , who made a brief substitute appearance after more than a year out with a knee###injury . freiburg , who got off to a better start before conceding the first goal against the run of play , were furious with what they considered a harsh penalty decision for a tumble in the box by schalke 's max meyer . freiburg , who have now failed to score in their last four games , remained 16th and in the relegation###playoff spot .

brussels the european###union 's top trade official , in one of the first concrete proposals in the trade negotiations with the united###states , called on thursday for a new trans###atlantic group that would coordinate the work of united###states and european regulatory###agencies . the proposal , in a prague speech by karel de gucht , the european###union 's trade commissioner , came as the union and the united###states are trying to map out the ambition and scope of the negotiations for a potentially sweeping trans###atlantic trade pact . those talks , which began in july , have been delayed by the partial shutdown of the united###states###government , which caused the cancellation of a second round of talks that were to begin in brussels . the negotiating teams are already butting heads over existing industry regulations and standards in europe , which michael froman , the united###states trade representative , sharply###criticized last week . mr . de gucht delivered a retort on thursday to mr . froman 's criticism , warning the united###states that a beauty###contest will flatter no one and that neither side will be successful if it seeks to impose its system on the other . since last year , business groups on both sides of the atlantic have strongly lobbied for a regulatory###oversight group that would have the authority to continue to ensure that any new or existing united###states or european regulations are compatible . but european officials have warned that a new oversight group must not become a forum purely for business###interests or deregulation efforts . mr . de gucht 's proposal for such an oversight group , which he called the regulatory cooperation###council , appeared mostly aimed at reaching a joint position on the kinds of rules and standards that would be drawn up in the future , rather than revamping those currently in force , like ones that now restrict biotech products and have long frustrated american business###interests . even so , mr . de gucht was enforcing one of the top goals that europe shares with the united###states to put pressure on emerging economic superpowers like china to accept standards developed by the european###union and united###states on products and services as global###standards . the council would monitor the implementation of commitments made and consider new priorities for regulatory cooperation , mr . de gucht said in a speech delivered to a conference organized by the aspen###institute in prague . in some cases , it could also ask regulators or standards###bodies to develop regulations jointly that could then have a good chance of becoming international###standards . the regulatory council , mr . de gucht stressed , should be part of a trans###atlantic effort that promotes greater compatibility of our regimes and accelerates the development of global approaches . neither mr . de gucht in his speech nor his staff in discussing it gave any examples of specific industry sectors where the council would jointly make rules or develop standards in the future . but mr . de gucht did stress on thursday that an overall trans###atlantic trade agreement should support cooperation on automotive technical###regulations and the way medical###devices are regulated . officials at the office of the u.s . trade representative in washington could not be reached for comment on thursday###afternoon . trade experts said creating a body like the regulatory cooperation###council would be critical to achieving a meaningful deal , as europe and the united###states try to achieve something much broader than the lowering of tariffs that is the focus of many trade pacts . it 's not trade negotiators who will work out the terms of this trans###atlantic pact , said andr sapir , a senior###fellow at bruegel , a research organization in brussels . what 's really needed is a body that can bring together regulators who can talk whenever they need to business , consumers , and other branches of government in order to achieve some kind of convergence , he said . bringing together regulators was also vital , mr . sapir said , because there 's no way that one approach would fit the bill across all sectors . a trade deal could bring huge benefits to the two economies , which between them already account for about half of global economic###output and a third of world trade . as a specific example , mr . de gucht described on thursday a.5 percent tariff that czech tire exporters pay to the united###states###treasury that should be relatively easy to remove . but doubts about how much progress europe and the united###states will be able to make arose even before the talks officially###began this summer . the potential sticking points include the way europe restricts biotech foods and the way some american states restrict which companies can apply for public###procurement contracts . those public###procurement rules will be anything but easy to address , mr . de gucht said on thursday . politicians on both sides have previously described a deadline for a trade deal by the end of . but there is a widespread and growing perception that such a time frame is overly###ambitious . and the verbal###sparring between mr . de gucht and mr . froman might only reinforce that skepticism . speaking in brussels early last week , mr . froman criticized european standard###setting bodies as being eurocentric and suggested that european###union authorities could learn from aspects of the united###states approach to rule making , which he described as more transparent . mr . de gucht fired back on thursday , insisting that europe 's system was highly transparent , involved close###collaboration with all interested groups and draws from the best science available . mr . de gucht did acknowledge , however , that managing 28 european###union member states with often divergent agendas takes more effort because there are more people around the table .
( reuters ) double major winner and world number three rory###mcilroy will tee off alongside u.s . masters champion adam scott at this year 's australian###open in sydney , organisers said on saturday . the 24 year old briton , who followed up his 2011 u.s . open triumph with a victory at last year 's u.s . pga###championship , will return to play the tournament held at the royal sydney golf###club from november 28 december 1 after a seven year absence . it will mark the first time he has taken part in the event since , when he finished in a tie for 59th competing as an amateur . the event , co sanctioned by oneasia and the pga###tour###of###australasia , will also witness a home appearance for australia 's world number four scott , who became the first golfer from his country to triumph at augusta national earlier this year . it 's been a few years since i last competed in an australian###open , mcilroy , who also played in the australian###masters in 2007 in melbourne and finished###tied for 15th , said in a statement from the organisers . i am very much looking forward to returning to royal sydney . former world number one mcilroy , who has endured a patchy season , showed glimpses of a return to form at last week 's u.s . pga###championship at oak hill , where he finished in a tie for eighth after flirting with a missed cut in his second round .
boston adam###wainwright had just lost for the second time in five games in this world###series , leaving the st . louis###cardinals in a desperate###situation . they will need to win two games in boston , if they are going to beat the surging red###sox . but wainwright appeared calm after he and the cardinals lost game 5 on monday , seemingly unconcerned about what lay ahead . he reminded everyone that michael###wacha would be pitching next . wacha , as a 22 year old rookie , had already earned the trust of his teammates . he had already won a playoff elimination game on the road , carrying a no###hitter into the eighth###inning against the pittsburgh###pirates in game 4 of the national###league###division###series . he had already outdueled one of the best pitchers in baseball , the los###angeles###dodgers' clayton###kershaw twice in the n.l . championship###series . and he had already won a world###series game in boston , too . now the cardinals will turn to him for game 6 on wednesday at fenway###park with their season on the line . he 's been amazing for us this postseason , wainwright said monday after a 3 1 loss in game 5 in st . louis . we really do n't###expect anything less from him going back there . wacha has not lost in four starts this postseason , striking out 28 batters and allowing only three runs over 27 innings . two of those runs came in game 2 last thursday when david###ortiz lifted a 3 2 changeup over the green###monster in the sixth###inning . wacha had been dominant to that point , allowing two hits over five innings . on his third time through the order , though , wacha could not contain ortiz . there was no shame in that . ortiz is hitting . 733 in the series , doing most of the heavy###lifting for his teammates , who are collectively batting . 151 . the discrepancy between ortiz 's success and that of the rest of the team did not seem to bother the red###sox very much as they prepared to face wacha for a second time . jonny###gomes pointed to how they had rebounded in the american###league###championship###series against detroit starter anibal sanchez , who compiled an a.l . leading . 57 earned###run###average this season . sanchez held the red###sox hitless for six innings in his first start of the a.l.c.s . in his second start , the red###sox battered him for nine hits and four runs ( three earned . it 's definitely going to help a lot more than the first time , gomes said of facing wacha . we 've done a really good job building on our failure , like we did against sanchez . but saying the same thing , wainwright came out and turned it around . he got to us . i do n't think it 's a coin###flip . it 's a race to adjustments , getting a couple of lucky hops . those fans are going to be rocking and rollin' too . they 're gonna be pumping us up . opposing wacha will be john###lackey , who started and won game 7 of the 2002 world###series as a 24 year old rookie with the los###angeles###angels . thinking back to that series , lackey said he was more excited than nervous . but , lackey suggested , he was expected to go only deep enough to hand the game over to the angels' strong bullpen . my job was just basically not to screw it up , lackey said . whereas wacha is now expected to save his team . the cardinals not only lost both games started by wainwright , their ace , but they also have scored only three runs in the past two games . the way he has been hitting , ortiz could possibly outproduce the cardinals' lineup by himself in game . unrelated to their struggles at the plate , the cardinals also had some problems getting out of st . louis , where their plane was delayed by mechanical###problems . i just try to approach every game the same , wacha said on a conference call as he waited to take off . i do n't think it 's going to be too much different . we know the next two games are must wins . it all starts with me tomorrow###night . wacha will take the mound for the first world###series game 6 at fenway since carlton###fisk 's 12th inning###home###run beat the cincinnati###reds in , with fisk trying to will the ball fair by waving his hands . but the red###sox went on to lose the series in game . the last time the red###sox clinched a world###series at home , babe###ruth was on the team and the year was . the cardinals will be trying to become the first team to win games 6 and 7 of a world###series on the road since the 1979 pirates did so against the baltimore###orioles . this will be legendary , wainwright said , if we go into boston and win two games .
going underwater with video###cameras and sonar , scientists have gained new insights into the mating###behavior of humpback###whales . they learned that female humpbacks on the prowl prefer the largest males on the breeding###ground , while smaller###males gravitate###toward smaller females apparently so as to run less risk of a big male coming over and beating you up , said adam pack , a biologist and psychologist at the university of hawaii at hilo . it 's basically making the best of a poor situation , he added . dr . pack and his colleagues , who report their findings in the journal animal###behavior , tracked 67 dyads , or pairs of male and female whales , in the pacific###ocean off hawaii . although humpback mating has never been seen , it is likely that these were mating pairs , dr . pack said . ( the whales migrate from alaska each year to breed , fasting and relying on stored reserves to survive . ) the researchers used underwater videogrammetry to capture###images of the whales at sea . the technique involves recording the whales with a camera , using a sonar device to estimate the distance of the whale from the camera as well as other measurements . with a little bit of geometry , we can determine the true length of the whale , dr . pack said . the information allowed the scientists to estimate the likelihood that a given whale had reached sexual###maturity they also used historical###data . if you can actually photograph an underside of a whale 's tail , you have a unique marking you can compare to prior pictures , dr . pack said . some of these smaller###sized females were nonetheless sexually###mature . the researchers also found that juvenile whales were pairing off in male###female dyads . like teenagers , they are probably learning the social###conventions , dr . pack said .
besides the fact that i played guard and martin is a tackle , i was also perplexed because , well , he is a 6 foot 5 312 pound professional###football###player , and i am a political reporter for the new york times , who barely cracked 200 pounds at the height of my high###school glory###days . then there is the fact that i have nyt in my twitter handle ( jmartnyt , and my history nerd avatar is a picture of lyndon b . johnson 's two beagles , her and him , perched on the south lawn of the white###house . all this had done little to stop a flood of twitter messages aimed my way in the weeks since news broke that the other jonathan martin had left his team . as reports of the treatment of martin by a fellow lineman , the more improbably named richie###incognito , became the biggest story in sports , my mentions on twitter began including about an equal mix of hang in there notes of encouragement and pointed inquires about the robustness of my manhood . since the dolphins were defeated by tampa###bay , 22 19 , on monday###night , though , there has been less good will and their fans have become even more pointed . u got a beagle dog as ur profile pic n ur in the nfl , wrote calli , who also used a vulgarity to accuse me of ruining the dolphins' season . somebody named runrickyrun ( handle lordgexs ) was a bit more delicate about my namesake 's absence from miami 's offensive###line . the dolphins need ya back asap ! ! ! ! ! jmartnyt 68incognito . apparently , when you type jonathan martin into the twitter search form , my account comes up with that of my dolphins doppelg###nger . at first , i found the confusion quite amusing . so did my family . my wife , betsy , is also a journalist and has been tickled about not only the continuing twitter mix up but has also gotten a kick out of how my byline was now in some unlikely headlines ( in the case of jonathan martin , remember that even big guys cry . instead of correcting people on twitter , i have been reposting some of the more egregious but pg rated misdirected messages . ( there have been plenty of obscene ones , too . ) and i have been fascinated watching the twitter ecosystem work when people like kyle pacheco who urged me , with an expletive mixed in , to handle my business like a grown###man not a 5 year old were upbraided by others on the microblogging site for having the wrong guy . as the story has intensified and misplaced 140 character assaults have piled up , though , the misunderstanding has lost some of its charm . i feel###bad for my fellow jonathan martin lord knows what his twitter feed looks like but the whole affair has also been a reminder about how ugly discourse can be on the internet . during campaign season , nasty , even abusive , emails and twitter messages are standard###fare for political reporters . partisans ( or , in this case , fans ) say things online they would never contemplate saying to the face of a stranger , let alone one the size of the brawny jonathan martin . as one person said in a message to me this week , it is keyboard courage . but i do not want to turn this into some tut tutting riff on our ever coarsening society . as an avid sports fan , i found it pretty neat to receive a shout out from deadspin and to wake up tuesday###morning to find an email request to call into wfan 's boomer and carton morning show . ( i did resist the temptation to drop in a longtime listener , first time caller , when i went on the air . ) before i became entranced by history and politics , my first passion was sports playing backyard whiffle ball and sandlot football with my brother , jeremy , and our friends reading about games in the sports section and poring over sports###illustrated when it came in the mail each thursday and collecting cards and autographs from the players i admired . i still have close###friendships with some of my high###school###football teammates . the bullying we received as underclassmen was mild just the occasional dead fish left in our shoulder###pads . i was not going to come close to the n.f.l . i rode the bench for a single year of division###iii college ball but even as my career plateaued , my love for the game has continued to grow . just ask my wife , who will see ( endure ? ) her fifth football game of the fall this weekend . all of this is to say that by my lights , there are worse people to share a name with than a stanford educated former all american who was taken in the second round of the n.f.l . draft . i was reminded of this tuesday when i received a message from gerry sandusky , a baltimore sportscaster who is not related to jerry###sandusky , the former penn###state assistant who was convicted of sexually###abusing boys . i have walked where fate has now taken you , wrote gerrysandusky , who surely had it harder than me . what i have not done yet is send a twitter message to the other jonathan martin . so , big jonathan , you have my best wishes . this , too , shall pass . you will surely be representing our name again on the field soon . and to those of you who want to get in touch with big jonathan he is j martin .
paris the unemployment###rate in the euro###zone edged up in january to another record , official data showed on friday , as the ailing european economy continued to weigh on the job###market . that , along with new data showing a decline in inflation in the euro###zone , could prompt the european###central###bank to take steps to stimulate the economy when its governing###council meets on thursday , analysts said . unemployment in the 17 nation euro###zone climbed to . 9 percent in january from . 8 percent the previous###month , according to eurostat , the statistical###office of the european###union . for the 27 nations of the european###union , the jobless rate was . 8 percent , up from . 7 percent in december . all of the figures were seasonally adjusted . a separate eurostat report showed price pressures easing in february . in the euro###zone , the annual inflation###rate was . 8 percent , down from 2 percent in january and below the central###bank 's 2 percent target . the jobless data suggests that wage###growth is set to weaken from already low###rates and further depress consumer###spending , which has already been hurt by government austerity###measures , wrote jennifer mckeown , an economist at capital economics in london , in a research note . ms . mckeown said that the low inflation and high joblessness should leave the e.c.b . 's policy###options open , and that the central###bank might discuss an interest rate cut or other unconventional policies . there was some bright news on friday . a survey of european purchasing###managers by markit , a data and research firm , showed that german manufacturing output grew for a second consecutive month in february as new business levels improved . the composite german purchasing###managers' index rose to . 3 just above , the level that separates growth from contraction from . 8 in january . and the federal###statistical###office in wiesbaden reported that german retail###sales rose . 1 percent in january from december , when sales fell . 1 percent . another bit of data this week also supports the view that the german economy will recover from a fourth###quarter slump . the european###commission 's economic sentiment indicator for the euro###zone rose to . 1 in february from . 5 in january , with german confidence leading the gain . german industry is clearly rebounding and taking advantage from better external traction , wrote gilles mo c , an economist at deutsche###bank in london . employment is sometimes seen as a lagging indicator of economic###growth because companies try to avoid adding to their costs until they are convinced that a rebound is at hand . but despite the glimmers of hope in german industry , there are few reasons to regard a recovery as imminent . markit 's overall euro###zone purchasing###managers' index was unchanged in february at . 9 , indicating continued contraction . olli###rehn , the european###commissioner for economic###and###monetary###affairs , forecast on feb . 22 that the euro###zone economy would shrink . 3 percent this year , about the same as last year . the bloc 's debt problems , and the tax increases and government spending###cuts that have been prescribed as the remedy , have sapped spending###power , reducing business demand for labor . in absolute###terms , eurostat estimated that 19 million people in the euro###zone and more than 26 million in the european###union were unemployed in january . spain 's unemployment###rate was . 2 percent , and portugal 's was . 6 percent . austria had the lowest###rate , at . 9 percent , followed by germany and luxembourg , at . 3 percent each . greece 's unemployment###rate in november , the latest month for which eurostat has figures for the country , was 27 percent . france , which has the second largest euro###zone economy , after germany 's , had a.6 percent jobless rate in january . britain , which is not a euro member , had a.7 percent rate in november . that compares with unemployment rates of . 9 percent in the united###states in january and . 2 percent in japan in december .

washington nearly , 000 americans were denied guns in , according to justice###department data , because they lied or provided inaccurate###information about their criminal histories on background###check forms . yet only 44 of those people were charged with a crime . the staggeringly low number of prosecutions for people who lie and try , as it is called by law###enforcement officials , is being studied by the obama administration as it considers measures to curb gun###violence after the connecticut elementary###school shootings in december . a task###force headed by vice###president joseph r . biden jr . is expected to offer proposals to president###obama as early as tuesday . it is looking at a wide range of issues linked to gun crimes , including violence in video###games and movies , and gaps in mental###health treatment and background###checks . the most contentious initiatives , like reviving a ban on assault###weapons , would require congressional###approval and have drawn fierce opposition from gun###rights groups and republican###lawmakers , making passage a long shot . i would say that the likelihood is that they are not going to be able to get an assault###weapons###ban through this congress , david keene , the president of the national###rifle###association , said sunday on the cnn program state of the union . in the face of those difficulties , the white###house has said it is looking for actions it can take without congressional###approval . increasing the number of prosecutions for lying on background###check forms is an effort that the administration can undertake largely on its own , in part by pressing federal###prosecutors to pursue such cases . it is also one measure that both sides of the gun###control debate have agreed upon . it is a felony to deliberately provide false###information in an effort to buy a gun , and studies financed by the justice###department show that people who do so are more likely than the average person to commit violent###crimes after they are denied a firearm purchase . at a meeting mr . biden held with gun###control advocates on wednesday , the group mayors###against###illegal###guns recommended to the administration that it should instruct the justice###department to investigate those who are denied guns and who have a history that suggests they might commit violence . in a memorandum provided to the administration , the group suggested that armed career criminals who have at least three prior violent felonies and or serious drug###offenses and would qualify for a mandatory sentence of 7 to 15 years should be prosecuted if they lie on background###check forms . the group said that it provided a similar recommendation to the obama administration in . the memorandum said that more than 800 mayors in the united###states support more aggressive prosecution of those who fail background###checks . this is not like looking for a needle in a haystack these are people you know are too violent to buy a gun , john feinblatt , an official with the mayors' group who met with mr . biden on wednesday , said in a telephone interview . once they have been rejected , they go online or to a private seller or a gun show and get a gun . the low number of prosecutions in , the most recent year for which data are available , is consistent with other years . prosecuting these cases has proved###challenging because to get a conviction you have to prove that the person knew they were lying when they tried to purchase the firearm , said a senior justice###department official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss###matters related to gun###control before mr . biden 's proposals are announced . a conviction usually carries a maximum###sentence of just six months , the official said , adding that with a limited number of federal###prosecutors the government has to prioritize its use of resources . although gun###control advocates have been more vocal about the issue , the n.r.a . also supports similar###action , arguing that the administration should enforce the gun###laws that already exist before making new ones . it has been a longstanding frustration of the national###rifle###association that there 's no follow through or follow up on these cases and criminals , and those who should n't be trying to buy guns have been getting away scot free , said andrew arulanandam , an n.r.a . spokesman . mr . arulanandam said that the n.r.a . has for decades been trying to get prior administrations republicans and democrats to take action on the matter but there seems to be no will by the justice###department to enforce existing gun###laws .
seeking an elusive middle###ground on an issue that has divided its ranks and drawn heated national###debate , the boy###scouts###of###america on friday proposed ending its longstanding ban on openly###gay scouts but continuing to bar gay adults from serving as leaders . the decision must be approved by the roughly , 400 voting members of the scouts' national###council at a meeting in texas the week of may . no youth may be denied membership in the boy###scouts###of###america on the basis of sexual###orientation or preference alone , the proposed policy states . but the organization will maintain the current membership policy for all adult###leaders . the proposal drew swift criticism from both sides as conservative christians said the boy###scouts had caved in to political pressure , and gay###rights groups said they were perpetuating discrimination and dangerous stereotypes about gay men . the issue of gay members and leaders has particularly tormented the boy###scouts over the last year as the organization first said it would not change policy , then said it would , then put off a decision until the may council meeting . the dismissal of a lesbian cub###scout den leader , in particular , had received wide###publicity , and gay###rights groups stepped up a campaign for change . several local###governments and charities said they could not donate to the scouts or sponsor troops because of its discrimination against gay people . on the other side , conservative politicians and religious###groups urged the boy###scouts to continue with the longstanding policy of ejecting boys and dismissing leaders who were openly###gay . the boy###scouts were forced to confront the question of sexual###orientation at a time when the public has become more accepting of homosexuality , but the issue remains deeply polarizing . already suffering a long###term decline in membership , the organization had to move carefully , its leaders said in private , because most of its local troops were sponsored by churches , some of which call homosexual behavior a sin . the mormon church and the roman###catholic###church , together , sponsor groups enrolling about one fourth of all scouts . both churches have in the past said they might abandon the boy###scouts if it altered its policy on gay members and leaders . the mormon church , which uses the boy###scouts as a main program for youth training , was noncommital on friday , saying only that it would study the proposed resolution before the may meeting . deron smith , a spokesman for the scouts , declined to describe their discussions with church###leaders . we have more than , 000 local scouting units , and reactions will no doubt vary , he said . we value our relationship with all of them . in recent###months , the boy###scouts have conducted discussions and surveys on the issue around the country , with results that mirrored the country 's changes and divisions over gay###rights . they found that while a majority of adults involved with scouting supported the past policy of excluding gays , parents under the age of 50 and a majority of teenagers opposed it , according to a summary of the findings released friday . while mr . smith declined to explain the reasoning behind the different treatment of leaders and youths , the study summary says that many adults had expressed particular concern about child safety and whether gay men were appropriate role###models . the scouts , like other institutions serving children , have been jarred in recent###years by sexual###abuse scandals from the past . but four experts consulted by the scouts , the summary said , said that homosexuality is not a risk###factor for sexual###abuse and that there was no evidence that having a gay leader would alter a child 's sexual###orientation . on friday , a conservative christian###coalition of past and current boy###scouts , parents and leaders called onmyhonor . net , which was formed to lobby the boy###scouts on the issue , condemned the proposed changes with a statement titled boy###scouts resolution caves to outside pressure . but gay###rights advocates attacked the scouts for failing to open up their leadership ranks . the boy###scouts have missed an opportunity to exercise leadership and usher the organization back to relevancy , said richard ferraro , the vice###president of the gay and lesbian alliance against discrimination . what this resolution appears to be doing is reinforcing the outrageous idea that gay people somehow pose a threat to kids , which experts like the american###psychological###association have dismissed for more than a decade . jennifer tyrrell , a lesbian parent in ohio whose dismissal last year as her 7 year old son 's den leader received national###publicity , said friday in a statement one year after sending a letter ousting me as my son 's leader , the boy###scouts are once again forcing me to look my children in the eyes and tell them that our family is n't good enough . but martez moore , chief###operating###officer of the scouts' middle###tennessee council , said he supported the proposal , especially the continued barring of gay leaders . in surveys , he said , local parents were overwhelmingly in support of banning gay scout leaders . he said he did not expect that a decision to admit openly###gay boys as scouts would have a major effect . scouts who are gay usually decide with their own families whether they want to stay in a troop , he said . it is a decision made within a family , not usually within the scouts . bob hopper , the scout executive for the mid iowa council , which serves 400 troops with about , 000 members , said he thought the proposal struck a good balance . we 're going to be accepting of youth and still allow those churches to have their faith standard on social###issues , he said . some people , he added , will be disappointed with the continued ban on gay leaders . boy###scout officials stressed that they hoped to keep issues of sexuality out of their program . the proposed resolution says that scouting is a youth###program , and any sexual###conduct , whether homosexual or heterosexual , by youth of scouting age is contrary to the virtues of scouting . the resolution continues , the boy###scouts###of###america does not have an agenda on the matter of sexual###orientation , and resolving this complex issue is not the role of the organization , nor may any member use scouting to promote or advance any social or political position or agenda .
annika sorenstam 's participation in the pga###tour event at colonial country###club 10 years###ago did not change people 's thinking overnight the way billie###jean###king 's exhibition tennis match against bobby###riggs in another part of texas had 30 years before . unlike king 's straight###sets bludgeoning of riggs at the houston###astrodome in , sorenstam 's payoff in fort###worth was delayed . she posted rounds of 71 and , missing the cut by four strokes , but the passage of time has allowed people to better appreciate her achievement and recognize her contribution to gender###equality . consider arron###oberholser , a rookie in the 2003 colonial field , who did not understand what sorenstam was trying to prove . before the tournament , oberholser expressed a view shared by other men that her participation posed a serious threat to golf 's ecosystem . if she plays really well , she 'll open up a can of worms , he said in an interview with golf###world . and if , heaven forbid , she won ? then she 's a member of the pga###tour , he said . all hell will break###loose . oberholser missed the cut at five over par , tied with sorenstam , who finished ahead of 11 players . looking back , he said in a recent telephone interview i was wrong . at the time i remember it not really kind of jibing with me , specifically for the reason that the women have their own tour . i thought it was opening pandora 's box . he added you can say she did n't###succeed because she did n't make the cut , but it was such a small sample . had she been able to play in 22 to 25 events , she would have been competitive . i think she would have finished in the top 180 on the money list , which would have given her conditional status . sorenstam , 42 , was the first woman in 58 years to play in a pga###tour event . the fear that the pga###tour would be overrun by women pulled along in her slipstream proved unfounded . suzy whaley , a p.g.a . of america professional , competed two months later in the greater###hartford open , having earned her spot by winning the connecticut p.g.a . section championship . the only other woman since then to compete alongside the men was michelle###wie , who played in 13 men 's professional events beginning when she was . when you 're buried in your own game , like i was as a rookie , you 're not looking at the ladies' tour , oberholser said . at the time i was n't paying###attention . i did n't know annika was dominating the ladies' tour . sorenstam was an 11 time winner on the l.p.g.a . tour in 2002 and collected six more victories in 2003 on her way to 72 career tour titles . she had no peers among the women , as oberholser soon found out . at the end of , he struck up a conversation on an arizona driving###range with the golfer angie rizzo . in , when their friendship took a romantic turn , he received a crash course in women 's golf . he began to understand sorenstam 's motivation for playing colonial . we get lazy on the pga###tour , said oberholser , who married rizzo in 2007 and is working for the golf###channel while recovering from a career###threatening wrist###injury . we take some things for granted , like how much attention is paid to us because of tiger , referring to tiger###woods . he added we have this saying on golf###channel tiger does n't move the needle he is the needle . the ladies are looking for their needle . they do n't work any less hard or have any less talent than the men . they just do n't have that player who makes people pay###attention . people took notice of sorenstam at colonial . the tournament distributed 565 news###media credentials in , compared with 337 for this week 's event . among those who tuned in to the telecast to watch sorenstam was stacy###lewis , a texan who has spent four weeks at no . 1 this year . she was a high###school senior at the time , and she was spending 18 hours a day in a brace to treat scoliosis and preparing for surgery . looking back , it got so much attention for the l.p.g.a . tour , and that was amazing , lewis said by telephone from the bahamas l.p.g.a . classic . only upon reaching the summit did lewis begin to fully###comprehend how high a climb she and the other women have in front of them . her second start as the world 's no . 1 was at the kraft###nabisco###championship , the first major of the year . when lewis , the 2011 champion , teed off for her first round , she had fewer than a dozen fans in her gallery . i look at right now and how hard i 'm having to work to get attention for our tour , lewis said , and it makes me really appreciate what annika was able to do that one week . she legitimately had a chance to make the cut , which shows how good she played . and her personality really came out , and she won more fans and that helped our tour . sorenstam won over some men 's players at colonial . dan###forsman said he was pulling for her to make the cut . we wanted it to be a great experience , he told###reporters at the time . referring to basketball , he added as far as the gap , can you imagine the dallas women 's team going up against nowitzki and those guys in a playoff###game ? on twitter this spring , dirk###nowitzki 's boss , the dallas###mavericks' owner , mark###cuban , floated the idea of drafting brittney###griner , the top women 's collegiate player from baylor . like lewis , griner grew up in the houston###area . griner , now with the w.n.b.a . 's phoenix###mercury , had not heard of sorenstam but recognized a kindred###spirit when she heard her story . like sorenstam , she was undeterred . i tweeted him back , she said , referring to cuban , and said , let me know when practice is . sorenstam 's career as a tour player is over , but her competitive###spirit lives on in the women who are willing to step out of their comfort zones .
xizhou , china brian linden welcomed the guests to his boutique###hotel in one of its courtyards at the end of a cobblestone alley here , surrounded by old stone###walls and polished wood balconies . he invited the group , from greenwich , conn . , to peruse the hotel 's book collection , which he created years###ago as a doctoral###candidate in sinology at stanford###university . and if any of you are light sleepers , what i recommend is , turn on the fan for some white###noise , mr . linden said . because there 's no white###noise here at all . the hotel is far from the noise of any major city , which mr . linden , an american who first arrived in china in 1984 as a student , thinks is one of its draws . he and his wife , jeanee , are among a small number of foreign entrepreneurs in rural china who operate boutique###hotels in restored properties that have historic charm . they converted a courtyard residential###complex in yunnan###province , built before the communist###revolution , into the linden centre . more hotel###rooms are being built in china than anywhere else in the world , according to data compiled by str global , a market forecaster . at the top end , luxury###brands like aman resorts and four seasons hotels and resorts are racing to open new hotels in the country . for some rooms , they are charging china 's emerging superrich the equivalent of more than a thousand###dollars a night . mr . linden and other foreign owners of smaller boutique###hotels say they would rather offer tourists more distinctive lodging . like japan 's ryokans , italy 's villas and america 's victorian bed and breakfasts , china 's boutique retreats could lure travelers with their link to the past , especially since they have been replaced in major###cities by modern###buildings . in china 's upscale hotel market , nobody 's taking the lead to do anything sustainably all they 're doing is just tapping into a flow of tourists , mr . linden said . some people have to come in here and really show china that there are other models , and those people have to be fairly altruistic because when we started , this was n't a very lucrative type of project . guests at the smaller independent hotels like mr . linden 's include a smattering of wealthy###chinese seeking escape from the bustle of big###cities , but the vast###majority are foreigners . mr . linden 's hotel is comfortable , but he offers few frills . he said that most chinese who can afford to stay nightly rates range from 900 to , 200 renminbi , or about 145 to 195 typically prefer more luxurious accommodations that include television sets and air###conditioning . the linden centre is a 25 minute taxi###ride from dali , a popular yunnan destination , and a morning 's drive from lijiang , a city of . 2 million that is one of china 's largest magnets for domestic###tourists . chris barclay , whose riverside boutique###hotel in guangxi###province features a restored mud###brick barn , said that many of his chinese guests booked for three nights . but they often leave after the first , out of frustration with the lack of amenities . local###officials are intrigued by his project , mr . barclay said , but are amazed that any hotelier would market such humble lodgings to upscale travelers . for the officials , it would be like building a hotel out of ice in lapland , mr . barclay said with a laugh . they 're still trying to process it . but huang yinwu , an architect in yunnan who for several years led a historical restoration in the shaxi valley financed by the swiss government , said many of the urban chinese he has met , whether backpackers or high###end travelers , are increasingly open to rustic getaways . for now , a handful of foreign hotel operators appear to dominate china 's market for boutique retreats . they acknowledge that their work can be challenging . it took the lindens three years to restore their courtyard complex , in part because it is protected by the same national###heritage regulations that apply to the great###wall . the restoration was complicated by jurisdictional battles among local , provincial and national###heritage officials , mr . linden said . mr . barclay had to negotiate with a village council that opposed his plan to install toilets in his yunnan###province inn , which was built during the qing###dynasty . ( he ended up renovating some nearby public###toilets . ) it also has taken several years to train his chinese staff to cater to foreign###guests , he said . and because foreigners are not allowed to own land , those who manage boutique###hotels under lease agreements are at the mercy of the local###authorities . legally , it 's a big###mess , said julien minet , a french ethnologist who operates a small bed and breakfast inn in a quiet village in anhui###province . maybe one day i will lose everything , and i 'm prepared for this .
atlanta in his final###season , atlanta###falcons tight###end tony###gonzalez found something else to help him improve . he started stretching at night . he was 37 and had worked 17 years in the n.f.l . enshrinement in the hall of fame was all but assured , yet he added to his routine . even with just four months left in a career that started in , he pushed himself to achieve more with his nightly workout . it was a push for new heights . the garrulous wide###receiver roddy###white bet gonzalez that he could no longer touch the 12 foot ceiling in the team 's weight###room . his athleticism challenged , gonzalez provided the retort with his stretching regimen . ask roddy how much of his money the old man is going to have in his pocket , gonzalez said . i touched that ceiling . raising the ceiling , not merely touching it , was the core of gonzalez 's career . on sunday###afternoon , he played his 270th and last game in the n.f.l. , and his legacy will be taking a once marginal position in the offense the brawny tight###end and transforming it into a conspicuous weapon . the 6 foot 5 gonzalez was agile and quick , and relatively fast . he started in kansas###city and continued in atlanta in . he was split out wide , allowed to stand up and motor into the secondary , catch passes out of the backfield , and worry a defense down the middle of the field . gonzalez finished his career sunday with , 325 receptions , the most ever by a tight###end and the second most catches on the career list , behind jerry###rice , 549 ) . gonzalez insists the trend of the dexterous tight###end was started by kellen###winslow and shannon###sharpe , but he perfected it , which is one reason the falcons rolled out a red###carpet for a farewell###ceremony at halftime . the crowd was much larger than it should have been at the georgia###dome for a team about to finish , and there were standing###ovations before the game and at halftime for a player who did as much as anyone to transform tight###end into a so called skill position . i was just lucky to be able to get that torch passed to me and be in some offenses where they trusted me to move me up from that traditional tight###end spot where you are not attached to the line where they can put you at receiver and put you in the slot , gonzalez said . putting me in the backfield , coming out of the backfield catching balls where you are just a weapon and it 's a matchup and you pose that matchup at all times . i 'm proud of the guys that have come after me , guys just coming up now , guys like gronkowski , guys like jimmy###graham , what they are doing with the position , and they are going to take it to new heights . it is likely that no one will soon take the position to the heights gonzalez took it . he caught passes for , 127 yards in his career and had 111 touchdown###receptions . gonzalez caught four passes for 56 yards in atlanta 's 21 20 loss to carolina on sunday , and it was not a more productive finale because falcons quarterback matt###ryan was sacked nine times as the panthers clinched the n.f.c . south crown . on the game 's first snap , split 5 yards out from the left###tackle , gonzalez caught a quick pass from ryan for a 5 yard gain . it gave him a reception in 211 straight###games . tony has only missed two games in 17 seasons that 's amazing , said alge###crumpler , an atlanta radio###host who was a four time pro###bowl###selection as a tight###end . i used to hang my hat on missing four games in 10 years . that 's unbelievable because he actually played in an era where you could hit guys going across the middle . tony was the prototype in what people are looking for in a tight###end . the 6 foot , basketball playing athletic guy that can position his body between the defender and be physical at the line of scrimmage . this was supposed to be a storybook finish for gonzalez , just like the one for baltimore###ravens linebacker ray###lewis , who retired after the 2012 season as a member of a super###bowl championship team . gonzalez , a 13 time pro###bowl###selection , had announced his intention###to###retire after the 2012 season , but after atlanta 's close loss to san###francisco in the playoffs , he was persuaded by ryan , among others , to return for a last chance at a super###bowl###ring . the falcons , however , never threatened for a title and had a five###game###losing###streak . but their tight###end never lost his zeal for the game . gonzalez kept catching 100 passes a day in practice . gonzalez never played in the super###bowl , but he said he was not going to let that wear on him in retirement . he said he would move back to california to be close to the one son who does not live with him and his wife . as he walked off the field for the last time , he appeared to wipe away tears and then gave a wave to family members in the stands and blew a kiss . my career , it 's turned out to be something more than i ever thought , and more than i ever dreamed , gonzalez said . i 'm still looking back and saying i ca n't believe this happened to me . it 's humbling .
( reuters ) san###jose###sharks winger raffi###torres has been suspended for the rest of the western conference###semi###finals for a hit to the head of los###angeles###kings forward jarret###stoll , the national###hockey###league ( nhl ) said on thursday . torres will miss a maximum six games if the best of seven playoff###series goes the distance and as little as four games if san###jose , which trails the series , wins four straight . the 31 year old canadian , who attended an in person hearing at nhl offices on thursday , delivered the hit late in the second period of tuesday 's series opener to the second round series and stoll did not return . rather than hit stoll through the core of his body torres takes a route that makes stoll 's head the principal point of contact , nhl disciplinarian brendan###shanahan said in a video on the league 's website . torres has been suspended three times and fined three times during his 12 year nhl career , including a 21 game ban during last season 's playoff for a hit on marian hossa of the chicago###blackhawks . the series resumes later on thursday in los###angeles .
los###angeles nothing is wrong with where dominic smith grew up . the yellow###brown lawns up the hill on 124th street could use more tending . it would be nice to see more pedestrians anyone , really . the faded paint on many houses suggests that more are rented than owned . but there are few barred###windows , no graffiti and hardly any other outward signs of trouble , as there might be a little farther###north in the heart of south###central or east across the harbor freeway toward compton , calif . this is a neighborhood in which smith always felt###comfortable playing###catch out front and rarely had to look over his shoulder while visiting a neighbor . even so , it was made clear to him from a young###age that a better life awaited him somewhere else . that was evident when his mother , sometimes with his help , would wash floors and clean bathrooms at his private elementary###school to help cover his tuition . or when his parents , in separate conversations in separate homes , admonished him not to repeat some of the choices they had come to regret . it was also not lost on the teenage smith when baseball took him to affluent###suburbs with manicured fields and magnificent homes , and , as the years went by , to new york , colorado , florida , australia and china . it was beautiful , smith said . it opened up my closed mind in thinking what was around the inner city , what was around my block and my friends here . it really opened up my mind to other cultures , other people 's lifestyles . it just helped me realize 124th street is n't the only place or area i could live . friends i grew up with , if they did n't###play baseball , they 've never been on an airplane before . all they know is their area of the inner city , what they do with their homies . they do n't know too much of nothing but that , and they do n't plan on getting to know nothing but that . it really helped me think that , o.k. , i do n't have to live here my whole life , and i could not be afraid to leave and go and experience new things . a new life is unfolding for smith since he signed a.6 million contract with the mets , who selected him with the 11th pick in last month 's amateur draft . the mets coveted smith , a left###handed hitting first baseman , because it is not hard to watch his silky swing and graceful glove and envision a franchise cornerstone once his cherubic face and his 6 foot , 195 pound frame fill out . but smith was struggling with such projections on his 18th birthday several weeks###ago , a day he spent packing , celebrating and saying goodbye to friends and relatives as he prepared for a cross###country flight the next morning to the mets' minor###league headquarters in port st . lucie , fla . in smith 's mind , he was still the boy who slept with his glove under his pillow and dressed in his little league uniform to watch games on television . honestly , it still seems like a dream , he said , sitting on the sofa in his mother 's house , laughing that he had never seen as much money as he was now being paid . i 've dreamed about this since i was a little boy , but you never really think , actually , that it can come true . smith 's incredulity is well founded . on opening day , african###americans accounted for only . 5 percent of major###league roster###spots ( about two players per team . it remains to be seen whether the last two drafts , in which 13 african###americans were chosen in the first round , are a sign that past initiatives , like the mlb urban youth###academy smith attended one in compton , calif . are creating a revival in the number of black prospects . in the 1960s and '70s , the predominantly###african###american neighborhoods south of los###angeles produced a trove of baseball players ozzie###smith , eddie###murray , reggie###smith , chet###lemon , bob###watson , dock###ellis , george hendricks , lyman###bostock , dan###ford , chili###davis , eric###davis , bobby###tolan and don###wilson among them . but when the mets chose darryl###strawberry with the no . 1 overall pick in , it turned out not to be a crowning###moment as much as a last hurrah . as basketball 's popularity###grew , financing for park programs was cut , and the advent of travel baseball priced out many youths from low###income###families . a pipeline became a trickle . coco###crisp is the rare current major###leaguer who grew up in the inner city here . baseball , perhaps more than any other sport , requires repetition , and those repetitions require partners to throw batting practice , hit infield grounders or catch a bullpen session , and instructors to hone the game 's finer###points .
ardmore , pa . phil###mickelson 's sunday at the 113th united###states open began with fans singing happy###birthday to him as he appeared on the practice range at 20 p.m . almost exactly five hours later , the fans in the grandstand behind the 18th green cheered , chanted and stomped their feet as mickelson walked toward them . in mickelson 's cavalcade of disappointment at the open , he often approaches a closing###scene like this with a lead . no one has finished second in the event as often as mickelson . he has had the lead at the open with three holes left and lost . once , he had the lead with two holes remaining and lost . and most famously , he had a one stroke lead with one hole to play in . he lost . but this time , mickelson trailed justin###rose by a stroke as he walked to his ball at the last hole , and perhaps the crowd grasped the juxtaposition , seizing upon the notion of a miracle turnaround . had mickelson not already holed a shot from 75 yards for eagle on the 10th hole ? this time , he needed to chip his ball up a steep###hill and run it across the green for a birdie that would force a playoff . after a succession of devastating , unpredictable defeats dating to , was n't mickelson due for something wholly unforeseen that left him smiling instead of stunned ? mickelson 's chip shot at the 18th roared toward the hole as every person in the grandstand stood . mickelson ran after the shot , chugging up the hill to watch the ball track across the green . but the line was imperfect . the ball missed by a few feet . there would be no miracle shot to save the birthday boy from a record sixth second place###finish . fifteen minutes later , a composed but disenchanted mickelson spoke frankly and expressively , hiding none of his discontent . when he was asked if he did not find a measure of accomplishment in playing well enough to have contended to the last moments of six united###states opens , he shook his head sorrowfully . if i have a win to match that , then yes , he said . but not now . and if i never get a victory here , then every time i think of the u.s . open i will think of heartbreak . and mickelson conceded that this defeat might be the hardest one to take of his six near misses . at , this one is probably the toughest , he said . this very well could have been my best chance . while it was easy to focus on the theater and drama of mickelson 's last chance birdie attempt at the 18th hole , he squandered his entirely legitimate opportunity to win hours###earlier . the hard###facts are that he began the day with a one stroke lead and responded with a four over par 74 in a final round that had far too many needless mistakes . it was a typically quirky last day at the open for mickelson a birdie , an eagle , three bogeys and two double bogeys . worse , he had 36 putts , a number that would trouble even a 15 handicapper . mickelson 's round began with uneventful pars but turned dramatically with a double###bogey on the par 3 third hole . he followed that with a second double###bogey just two holes later , butchering no . 5 with a three putt . those were two shots i should never have let go , said mickelson , well aware that simple bogeys on both holes were likely to have produced a monday 18 hole playoff . but mickelson 's mistakes blended with the tenor of the day , which was full of blunders . luke donald , who started just off the lead , conked a volunteer with a drive . steve###stricker hit one of the worst shots of the championship , a dead right shank that scooted across ardmore avenue until it was sitting beneath someone 's car . jason dufner was having a spectacular round until he launched a drive into one of the yards across from the 15th hole . frustration burst out everywhere . rory###mcilroy leaned hard on his wedge after a poor approach###shot , pressing down on it until it bent . but after an unsightly 39 on the front nine , mickelson suddenly###appeared blessed . after driving into the heavy rough on the par 4 10th hole , he lofted a shot onto the green that rolled unswervingly into the hole . his eyes wide , mickelson jumped in place and raised both arms the same goofy maneuver he performed when he won his first major , the 2004 masters . he was back in the lead . but success in these situations is often fleeting for the man they call phil the thrill . at the 121 yard 13th , the shortest hole at the merion###golf###club , a straightforward wedge aimed at a ball sitting on a tee produced a ungainly shot that was long and to the right . it led to bogey . it would not have been so bad if mickelson had not hit another poor wedge to bogey the 15th hole . just two bad shots at the wrong time that really cost me , mickelson said . as an afternoon sun ducked behind a line of clouds that eventually###brought rain , the once crowded leader board had been whittled to mickelson , rose and hunter###mahan . it was two guys eager to win a first major championship and one desperate to win his first open . mahan fell out of contention quickly , his last gasp a bogey at . mickelson fought back but could only muster pars at the 16th and 17th , his balky putter letting him down . with some steely resolve , rose made consecutive pars at the long and treacherous 17th and 18th to post a four round score of one over par . it was left to mickelson to birdie the 18th , a hole that had yielded no birdies all day . his drive at the 18th tee was crooked , but it stayed up in the rough . he hit a right to left approach###shot that landed well short of the green , but it did leave one implausible chance . the fans rose to greet him at the 18th green . they believed . what better way for a long running runner up to finally###break through ? the ball did not find the hole . there was no mickelson magic in the approaching dusk at merion . the fans sat down . phil###mickelson was second at the united###states open . again .
los###angeles the best teams in the national###basketball###association are typically able to win games playing ugly , and los###angeles###clippers coach doc###rivers wants to see his players develop this attribute . rivers was delighted with the outcome at a packed staples###center on saturday , but readily admitted he was taken aback by his team 's ability to deliver the 'ugly' script on cue as they overcame an erratic display to beat the utah###jazz . you 're playing hard , things still are n't going right and you 've got to find a way to win , the husky voiced rivers told###reporters after the ( 21 11 ) clippers took control of the game after the score was tied at 90 90 with 25 left . and that 's the team i want us to become one day . i did n't mean tonight but i will take tonight . every time we got a 10 point , nine point lead , it was almost guaranteed we 're going to have three turnovers in a row or bobble the ball . it was just one of those nights . we just made enough plays to win the game . power###forward blake###griffin shrugged off a career###high eight turnovers to pile up 40 points on 13 for 20 shooting , along with 10 rebounds , while all star point###guard chris###paul narrowly###missed a rare triple###double . paul , playmaker extraordinaire for the clippers and so often their prime closer , finished with 21 points , 10 rebounds and nine assists as he and griffin inspired one another with their 'must win' energy in the fourth###quarter . we just tried to get out the win , it 's not going to be pretty every night , paul ruefully said after the clippers ended a two game losing###streak by fending off a spirited fightback by the ( 9 24 ) jazz . we missed a lot of easy shots , i missed a few layups and we did n't convert a lot of lobs tonight but when it was winning time ( late in the fourth###quarter , we converted . me and blake have been talking a lot before the jump###ball about dominating and being aggressive , both of us , because i think the team feeds off our energy . so we 're just trying to keep rolling , keep piling up wins and playing the right way . griffin , a three time all star , has averaged . 9 points , 11 . 1 rebounds and . 4 assists in his last eight games while improving his once woeful free###throw###percentage to an impressive . 6 percent . paul is not at all surprised . his confidence right now is pretty high , and rightfully so , said paul , a six time all star . it 's great to see how he 's dominated games , whether he 's taking jump shots , posting up or going to the free###throw line . it 's fun to watch and i would n't know how to guard him . it 's not just the offensive end , it 's the defensive###end , his rebounding . and it 's contagious because i feed off of it . perhaps the most impressive thing about the clippers' win was that they avoided an emotional hangover after suffering heart breaking losses on the road in their previous two games , to the golden###state###warriors and the portland###trail###blazers . we just had to regroup , said griffin , referring to the 116 112 defeat in overtime by portland on thursday and the 105 103 loss to golden###state on christmas day . it 's about mentally moving on and learning from our mistakes . my team###mates just kept giving me the ball and giving me the confidence . they did their work and put me in a position to score easily , so i had to finish for them . though rivers was a frustrated figure as the clippers trailed the jazz after each of the first two quarters before ending the night with 13 turnovers , he felt his team was on the brink of achieving something special . it was amazing , rivers said . we miss how many dunks and lobs ? it was one of those games and it 's nice to win them . when you have the talent that we have , it 's more trying to get guys to play in the right spirit every night . and we 're getting there . i think our team is really close . i 've been saying it for a week or two , you can feel it . we 're close to being really good .
andy###murray 's first potential pitfall on his road to defending his united###states open###title was clearly marked in fluorescent orange , a traffic###cone next to a pothole . denis###istomin , clad in a shade of radioactive pumpkin ( which he eventually swapped for an equally bright colored yellow###shirt , played fearlessly from the baseline with flat power and was able to match murray 's strength if not his foot speed and anticipation . but istomin lost , 6 7 ( 5 ) , 6 1 , 6 4 , 6 4 , in 3 hours 7 minutes at arthur###ashe###stadium . murray wobbled significantly as he tried to close out a first set . leading by 5 4 in the tiebreaker , murray double faulted and then hit consecutive unforced###errors to give istomin the set . but istomin 's focus faltered with the lead , and murray , though often cursing the wind and his mistakes , never lost control . by the fourth set , an upset had been averted . murray could seemingly do little wrong . on break###point at , he framed a forehand that shot straight into the air but eventually carried in the wind and landed deep on the opposite side of the court , just inside the baseline . after istomin was forced to hit an awkward overhead , murray won the point several shots later , earning an appreciative high five from istomin during the changeover . murray will face ninth###seeded stanislas###wawrinka , who defeated no . 5 tomas berdych , 3 6 , 6 1 , 7 6 ( 6 ) , 6 2 , at louis###armstrong stadium . murray holds an 8 5 advantage against wawrinka , but won only three games the last time the two met , in monte###carlo in april , and lost to wawrinka in their most recent meeting at this tournament , in . murray 's struggles were in sharp###contrast to the domination of the top seeds earlier in the night . perhaps the one who had the easiest go of it was serena###williams , who needed only 53 minutes amid swirling wind to dispatch of carla###su###rez###navarro , 6 0 , 6 0 , in a quarterfinal###match at ashe . honestly , she 's a great player , williams said of su###rez###navarro , the no . 18 seed , who turned 25 on tuesday###night . the conditions today were so tough , so it was obviously not her best tennis day . it was su###rez###navarro 's first match at the cavernous stadium , which paled###in###comparison with the experience williams has accumulated in her career . only because i 've been playing here for like 50 years , joked williams , the defending###champion , who played her first united###states open in . i 've kind of gotten used to the conditions . su###rez###navarro earned her only two break###points of the match in the 11th game , but williams saved both with strong serves out wide to su###rez###navarro 's backhand that she followed forward to the net . williams hit 20 winners to just 3 by su###rez###navarro , and limited her unforced###errors to 9 compared with the spaniard 's . the victory was the seventh double bagel of williams 's career . the most recent was in the first round of the australian###open in january against edina###gallovits###hall . williams also won by the same score in the fourth###round of last year 's united###states open against andrea hlavackova . the increasingly consistent williams has won four of her seven double bagels since . she will face no . 5 li###na in the semifinals . li , a veteran from china , beat no . 24 ekaterina###makarova , 6 4 , 6 7 ( 5 ) , 6 2 .
pittsford , n.y . david hearn huddled with mike###weir at the canadian open about learning from near misses . weir , the 2003 masters champion , is now 43 and settling in as a mentor to his younger countrymen . hearn might be just coming into his own as a pro golfer at age . less than a month after losing in a playoff at the john###deere###classic for his best finish on the pga###tour , hearn shot a###4 under 66 on thursday in the first round of the pga###championship . that put him a stroke off the lead , tied with lee###westwood behind jim###furyk and adam scott . the last time the pga was played at oak hill 10 years###ago , weir was coming off his masters title and was in contention heading into sunday . the course is about 2 hours east of hearn 's hometown of brantford , ontario best known as the hometown of wayne###gretzky , who has also imparted athletic advice to hearn . hearn lost in a three man playoff july 14 to 19 year old jordan###spieth , the youngest###winner on the pga###tour in more than eight decades . hearn was not that sort of prodigy . he played on the web . com tour from . hearn describes himself as a patient golfer , a trait that has served him well in the bigger###picture . my career has always had a certain progression , and i 've always found a way to get competitive at the next level that i 've been to , he said . for me right now , it 's just a matter of trying to continue that on , and as i 've been on the pga###tour for a few years now , i 've gotten better at playing well in the bigger events . hearn bogeyed the first and last holes thursday but otherwise successfully###attacked the course with his driver , taking advantage of softer greens in the morning after overnight rain . hearn shot 69 in the final round of the john###deere to reach the playoff with spieth and defending###champion zach###johnson . the canadian missed a makeable putt on the fourth playoff###hole that would 've won it . spieth went on to win on the fifth extra###hole . proud of the way i played , hearn said . disappointed that it did n't quite go my way at the finish , but overall , played a really solid tournament . so it feels good for me to be in contention , and i feel like i 've been playing some really good golf the last few months . at the canadian open two weeks###ago , hearn shot 73 on sunday to tie for 44th . but that earned him just enough money to move up one spot on the pga###championship points list to first alternate , all but assuring him of a spot at oak hill . hearn also got in a good chat with weir . mike is at a point in his career now where he 's definitely wanting to give back more , and he 's definitely doing a good job of that , hearn said . he 's definitely trying to take on that mentorship role a little bit more with some of the players .

with so many negative adjectives used to describe jacksonville at the start of the season , it is easy to see why opponents that lost to the jaguars were shocked and embarrassed . in the last four weeks , chad###henne and company defeated tennessee , houston and cleveland , and each team had players who said they did not know how to handle the disappointment . i could n't care less what they think , cecil shorts iii , a jaguars wide###receiver , told###reporters this week . it 's the n.f.l . you 're going to win or lose each week . you 've got to bring your best that week . the texans , who seem to have taken over as the league 's laughingstock , should at least be more prepared this time . but the fans in jacksonville may want to take a week off from the video###game tents at everbank###field and sit###in the stands instead . the jaguars will probably win a home###game for the first time in more than a year .
thanks to carl###hagelin and cam talbot , the rangers remain on a tear . the columbus###blue###jackets , on the other hand , have reached a tipping###point . hagelin scored###two###goals receiving###credit for one when an opposing###player put the puck in his own net and talbot made 32 saves to lead the visiting rangers past the blue###jackets , 4 2 , on thursday###night . the rangers have won five of their last six to get to 8 8 on the season . we want to play better than we have , hagelin said . we know we should be . 500 at least . it 's good to be there now we 've just got to start climbing . for us , it was back to back nights , four in six nights , three in four , and the end of a pretty long stretch here where we played nine games in 15 nights , vigneault said . we did what we had to do to win the game . the rangers captain ryan###callahan and defenseman ryan###mcdonagh each added a goal and an assist . after columbus 's fifth loss in a row , forward brandon###dubinsky and coach todd richards said they were humiliated by the team 's lack of effort . there 's really nothing left to say , dubinsky said . it 's flat out embarrassing for us , our fans , for the organization . the blue###jackets closed last season on a 19 5 5 tear the second best record down the stretch in the n.h.l . but they are 5 10 this season and wallowing near the basement of the eastern###conference in their first year since moving from the west . there were plenty of familiar###faces on both sides four players on each team used to play for the other one . talbot , giving henrik###lundqvist a night off , was the third straight backup goalie to face the blue###jackets . all three have won , combining to give up just three goals . talbot made several solid saves in the scoreless third period , stymieing the former ranger artem###anisimov on a backhander in the crease on a power play in the final###minutes . he played great again , defenseman marc###staal said of talbot . he made very timely saves when we need them . he 's been rock solid since his first start . we have all the confidence in the world in him . hurricanes , islanders 0 justin peters stopped 21 shots in his third career###shutout , and carolina beat the visiting islanders . radek dvorak scored a deflected goal in the first period to help the hurricanes win their second straight after a five game slide that coincided with a lower###body###injury to the starting###goalie cam###ward . peters finished with the hurricanes' first shutout of the season . the backup kevin poulin made 23 saves in his second start in six days for the islanders . they have lost four of six and were shut out for the first time this season . devils , flyers 0 martin###brodeur stopped 22 shots , and adam###henrique and cam###janssen each scored a goal to lead the devils to a win in philadelphia . the flyers beat the devils , 1 0 , on saturday in new jersey . henrique 's first period goal would have been enough to stand in this one . brodeur was never seriously challenged against the n.h.l .

one of the most used metrics in predicting fantasy football performance is matchup analysis ( player versus opposing defense . a particular team gives up a certain amount of fantasy points per game to this position , which is presumed to be a relevant statistic when deciding which player to start that week . matchup analysis is important to consider when making fantasy football decisions ( as long as it is combined with basic knowledge of the n.f.l . ) , but that can depend on the position . of all of the key offensive###positions , f.p.p.g . statistics for wide###receivers are the most vague because the numbers include points scored by all receivers on the team . one way to make better use of this statistic is to focus on the top receiver from each team , or what we in fantasy football like to call an wr , and determine how defenses fare against him . it goes without saying that wr1s are the most fantasy relevant of all receivers and that n.f.l . teams usually treat them differently , deploying their best defensive###backs in an effort to stop them . once you determine each team 's wr1 ( by mostly referring to team depth charts , it is easy to calculate how many fantasy points per game defenses allow to wr1s . though this metric will change slightly from week to week , with 10 weeks of data to work with , we do have a sense of what a receiver will be up against over the final seven weeks of the season . this color###coded chart looks ahead to the rest of the season and assigns a shade of red for a favorable matchup and a shade###of###blue for unfavorable . white represents neither . also included are results from previous weeks , so you can get a sense of which receivers are matchup proof and who is hot or cold heading into the next game . here are a few things i learned while researching this data , and some other points to keep in mind while using the chart . the most crucial weeks of the fantasy football season are weeks 14 to 16 in the n.f.l. , which is when most fantasy leagues have their playoffs . among the elite receivers , no two are set up better to have productive games than the philadelphia###eagles' desean###jackson and the washington###redskins' pierre garcon . both will have three straight###games against teams that allow at least 12 f.p.p.g . to wr1s this season . the cleveland###browns are a team you do not want to see on the schedule if you are an wr . they allow an average of . 2 f.p.p.g . to top receivers and have only allowed one to reach 10 points once ( the green###bay###packers' jordy###nelson in week . just because a defense is bad does not necessarily mean it is a good matchup for an wr . the jacksonville###jaguars are the n.f.l . 's 28th ranked###defense ( 20th in passing defense , but allow just . 1 f.p.p.g . to wr1s , the fifth fewest in fantasy football . one could speculate that this is because offenses focus on the jaguars' poor run###defense . but considering the jaguars are the third best fantasy matchup for quarterbacks , it is a head scratcher . maybe it only boils down to the fine play of cornerback will blackmon . the st . louis###rams and the san###diego###chargers have been an wr1 's best friend through 10 weeks . each has allowed wr1s about 15 f.p.p.g . looking ahead to week , the miami###dolphins' mike###wallace has the pleasure of facing the chargers ( the rams have a bye . matchups are not everythingjust because the cincinnati###bengals' a . j . green is up against the browns this week does not mean you should not start him . the league 's best receivers can score on any team . also , a mediocre receiver is not guaranteed success just because he has a great matchup the tennessee###titans' kendall wright scored just 6 points against the rams in week . this chart can help guide your decisions , but it should not replace common###sense .
stanford , calif . bashaara graves tried to keep chiney ogwumike off the boards on both ends of the court any way she could to no avail . for a tennessee team so well accustomed to owning the rebounding advantage against opponents , ogwumike 's dominance on the glass made all the difference in the third ranked lady###vols' 76 70 loss to sixth ranked stanford on saturday for tennessee 's first defeat . ogwumike had 32 points , a season best 20 rebounds 11 on the offensive end and three blocks as stanford held off a late tennessee rally . everything i tried to do , i tried to box her out , it just did n't work , graves said . there 's no way she should have had that many offensive###rebounds . stanford coach tara###vanderveer had one simple###message for her players before tipoff that rung true if we rebound , we win . amber orrange scored on a left handed layin and was fouled with . 8 seconds###left and converted the free###throw , helping seal the win . andraya carter 's baseline 3 pointer with 02 remaining cut the cardinal 's lead to 70 68 but stanford kept possession with 36 seconds to go on a jump###ball in a big###break , and orrange came through . stanford ( 10 1 ) has its first three game winning###streak in the rivalry between perennial national powers . it 's going to be a great teaching tape for us when we get back from break , tennessee coach holly warlick said . ariel massengale scored 17 points and meighan simmons 15 to lead the lady###vols , who were hurt . 8 percent###shooting . tennessee has lost its last four matchups at maples###pavilion since its last win on stanford 's home floor on dec . 4 , 2005 . the lady###vols have lost 13 straight road games against top 10 teams dating back to . the cardinal held a 24 19 rebounding advantage in the first half and wound up with a 43 40 edge on the boards the first time all season tennessee has lost in rebounding . the lady###vols had a.1 to . 3 mismatch on the boards entering the game . we 're a very strong rebounding team but we ca n't allow somebody to dominate on the boards like we did chiney , warlick said . while ogwumike did her part with a fourth 30 point game of the season , she had plenty of support on both ends with teammates crashing the boards and hustling for loose###balls just the kind of balance and energy vanderveer has been calling for from her young team . we did n't###bring that tennessee pressure we know we 're capable of playing , massengale said . we knew we would have to disrupt them on the offensive end for us to win this game . we did that in spurts but not for 40 minutes . ogwumike had 18 points and 11 rebounds by halftime and shot 15 for 25 overall for outsized stanford , which needed a big second half to hold on for its ninth###straight victory . i have a great support system , she said . it 's just being aggressive . it 's those little things . after graves scored to cut the cardinal 's lead to 38 33 with 10 remaining , orrange and thompson hit consecutive 3 pointers for stanford . but massengale then scored five straight###points to keep tennessee close . ogwumike drove the lane for easy layins , converted athletic putbacks or plain out jumped tennessee to catch high lob passes into the paint before pivoting around to score . this game really boiled down to we had chiney , vanderveer said . chiney had a monster game . the cardinal , who have n't lost since a 76 57 defeat at no . 1 connecticut on nov . 11 , have won five of the last eighth meetings and four of five . tennessee , facing just its second ranked###team of the season , missed a chance for its first win over a top 10 opponent since beating no . 10 georgia in the lady###vols' sec home###opener last jan . 6 . stanford snapped tennessee 's five game winning###streak here last nov . 20 , 2012 , 97 80 loss for the fifth most points allowed in program history . tennessee began the game 6 for 23 and never recovered despite making things###interesting down the stretch with simmons taking###charge . i thought we got good looks , warlick said . you 've got to make free throws , layups and free throws . if you do n't make those you 're not going to win games . at crucial times we did n't make free throws , and at crucial times we gave up the 3 point shot . little things for us got magnified today . after tennessee jumped to a quick 4 0 lead , stanford then scored 13 unanswered###points for a 13 4 lead that forced a lady###vols timeout at the 54 mark of the opening half . tennessee missed seven straight shots over a nearly 3 1 2 minute stretch . we do n't give up , warlick said . we could have really folded when we got down by . for that i 'm extremely###proud of them .
new orleans drew###brees could n't quite suppress a smirk as he deadpanned the saints' prescription for playing better on the road , which is where they 'll be for the playoffs . there 's three main things we need to do , brees began . we 're going to change up the gatorade flavor , we feel good about that . we 're going to change our travel sweats . we 're going to change , at the hotel , the beefy mac ( and cheese ) recipe the night before , just kind of give it a little extra kick . we feel like those three things are going to help pull us through . for one last time this season , brees and the saints proved how tough they are to hang with in the big###easy , clinching an nfc wild###card spot sunday with a 42 17 rout of the downtrodden tampa###bay###buccaneers . brees was his usual prolific self , passing for four touchdowns and even running for a score as new orleans ( 11 5 ) concluded the regular###season 8 0 at home . but the saints went 3 5 on the road this season , and they had little time to celebrate their widely###anticipated triumph over the bucs before fielding questions about what they can do to change their fortunes outside the superdome . we 're going to be told all week long that we ca n't###win on the road , right tackle zack strief said . we all acknowledge why people say that , and yet , the other games do n't matter not anymore . if the saints can indeed summon superdome like performances in the coming###weeks , they 'll be a dangerous no . 6 seed . new orleans opens the playoffs saturday###night at nfc###east champion philadelphia . three of brees' scoring strikes against tampa###bay went longer than 40 yards 76 to kenny stills , 44 to lance###moore and 41 to robert###meachem . brees passed for 381 yards , eclipsing , 000 yards in a season for an unprecedented fourth time . he finished the season with , 162 yards to go with 39 touchdowns . we did a lot of things well today at time when we needed to , saints coach sean###payton said . i 'm proud of how they finished . ... it 's hard to get 11 wins in this league . brees' other td was a 10 yard###pass###to###tight###end jimmy###graham . mike###glennon passed for 219 yards and two tds for tampa###bay . with doubts swirling about the future of second year bucs coach greg###schiano , tampa###bay closed the season with losses in its last three games , and four of its last five . any time you win only four games , there are definitely going to be some type of changes , right tackle demar dotson said . upstairs , downstairs i do n't know what it 's going to be . the saints had lost three of their previous four games to set up a season###finale they needed to win to assure themselves of a playoff###spot . they got back to the postseason for the fourth time in five seasons , the lone exception being , when payton was suspended the entire###season in connection with the nfl 's bounty probe . obviously , sean 's a huge part of the saints' return to the playoffs , brees said . four out of five years , winning an average of 12 games in every one of those ( playoff ) years . that 's a big###deal . schiano , meanwhile , coached like he had nothing to lose , trying a fake###field###goal , which failed , and going for it three times on fourth down , converting one . in the end , his team was overmatched , outgained 468 yards to . asked about his future , schiano said i do n't think i have to say anything . that 's not being smug . i come in and do my job the best that i can . that 's other people 's decision . schiano did call a successful flea flicker on which glennon found tiquan underwood for a 48 yard score to tie it at . glennon was also intercepted by keenan lewis , setting up brees' 9 yard touchdown run in the second half . pierre###thomas provided new orleans' other second half score on an 8 yard run . brees was 17 of 21 for 321 yards in the first half , when he threw all of his scoring passes and had a maximum . 3 passer###rating . his final line was 24 of 31 for 381 yards , no interceptions and a rating of . 4 . brees went over the , 000 yard mark in style , hitting meachem deep down the sideline to make it . glennon 's 1 yard pass to tim###wright in the corner of the end###zone cut it to , but stills' score made it , and the bucs did not threaten again . notes lewis' interception was his fourth . ... saints olb junior gallette had two sacks to reach a career###high . ... tampa###bay gave up season###highs in yards and points . ... the bucs have won four or fewer###games in three of the past five seasons .
the harvard professor and economics commentator niall###ferguson issued an unqualified apology over the weekend for suggesting that john###maynard###keynes was indifferent to the long###term###implications of his economic###theories because keynes was gay and had no children . mr . ferguson , who is the laurence a . tisch professor of history at harvard , has been an outspoken critic of keynesian###economics , warning that high government deficits would hurt economic###growth , rather than help it , as keynesians argue . the comments mr . ferguson apologized for came in response to an audience question on thursday at the strategic###investment conference in carlsbad , calif . , where he was a featured speaker . the questioner mentioned the familiar keynes adage favoring immediate government###intervention in the economy in the long run we are all dead . according to a reporter for financial###advisor , mr . ferguson 's language described keynes as effete , and said about his marriage to a russian###ballerina that he was more likely to be speaking with her of poetry rather than procreation . in his apology , mr . ferguson stood by his criticisms of keynesianism , but completely repudiated his reasoning last week my disagreements with keynes 's economic###philosophy have never had anything to do with his sexual###orientation . it is simply false to suggest , as i did , that his approach to economic###policy was inspired by any aspect of his personal###life . that a prominent professor is apologizing for comments about keynes more than 60 years after his death speaks to his still central role in the debate over the role of government in the economy . online , mr . ferguson 's comments became a proxy for that debate . at national###review , the opinion ranged from those who worried that his comments gave the other side an easy argument against austerity , to those like jonah###goldberg , who wrote that mr . ferguson 's argument was a common one . mr . goldberg listed the many conservative writers who had tied keynes 's views to his childlessness and gay relationships . george chauncey , a yale scholar of gays in american history , in an interview emphasized that he was not weighing in on the economic###arguments involved , but noted that mr . ferguson 's comments resembled past attempts to undercut gays in public life . the idea that homosexuals are so self centered that they pose a threat to the family , to the social###order has become a habit of thought in america , he noted , reaching its peak in the 1950s . rather than in the world of ideas , the most excruciating pressure was put on gay people who were rising into senior###ranks of management , he said , adding the fact that a man was n't married was a bar to reaching the highest###levels of authority of corporation . in his blog post , mr . ferguson described his comments as doubly stupid . first , it is obvious that people who do not have children also care about future###generations , he wrote . and he apologized for a factual error . referring to keynes 's marriage to lydia###lopokova , he wrote i had forgotten that keynes 's wife lydia miscarried .
east###rutherford , n.j . when eli###manning drops back to throw his first pass sunday against the dallas###cowboys , the football in his hands will be as familiar as an old friend . that is because the ball has been scoured , scrubbed , soaked and seasoned , a breaking in process that takes months and ensures that every ball used by the giants in a game will meet manning 's exact preferences . the leather will have been softened , the grip enhanced and the overall feel painstakingly assessed . there are no new balls thrown around in an n.f.l . game . a new ball , despised for its sheen and waxy gloss , is as popular as a late hit . for every n.f.l . game , each team has 12 to 20 balls that it has meticulously groomed and prepared according to the needs of its starting###quarterback . the balls , brushed and primed using various obvious and semisecret techniques , bear the team logo and are switched out from sideline to sideline depending on which team is on offense . that means that from series to series , the ball in play can feel wholly different , but each team 's quarterback always has a ball prepped by his equipment staff the way he likes it . nothing is left to chance . the giants , for example , have a special set of a dozen pregame practice balls so manning can warm up with footballs that will feel exactly the same as the game balls , which are inspected and approved by the game officials before play starts . in all , there are always about 36 specially###marked eli###manning balls sequestered and protected in four large ball bags . if a coach looking for a ball at practice should unwittingly approach one of the bags , the team 's equipment director , joe skiba , will pounce get away , those are eli 's game balls . skiba added no one is allowed to touch those balls . they 're precious###jewels . too much work has gone into them . when the giants play away games , the balls are kept in a special trunk , although it is not labeled game balls . that might lead to sabotage . there are all kinds of peculiar rituals and routines before an n.f.l . game carried out by pregame pad inspectors , the uniform police , sideline communications system overseers but perhaps no piece of the game within the game receives as much attention as the football . in the case of the giants , preparing the game balls used from september to december begins in summer###training###camp . the giants will start with six to seven dozen new footballs . sorting through them , skiba and his brother , ed , the assistant equipment director , will give each ball a once over . i 'll know as soon as i pick up a ball whether it could be a ball that eli might like some day or whether it 's a ball he 'll never like , ed skiba said . the skibas , who grew up in paramus , n.j. , have been with the giants since the 1990s , serving myriad quarterbacks . manning , like most , knows what he wants in a football . i want a brand new ball that feels like it 's 10 years old , manning said wednesday . you want it to feel like it 's been in your house for 10 years , where you 've been playing saturday###afternoon games with it for a long time . i want it broken in but it should still have nubs on it . the process has gotten better as we 've###changed some schemes and techniques . we 've honed in what works . the new ball is rubbed vigorously for 45 minutes with a dark brush , which removes the wax and darkens the leather . next , a wet towel is used to scour the ball until the ball 's outer###surface is soaked through . you 're not done until the ball is waterlogged and water will no longer bead on it , ed skiba said . while the ball is wet , it is brushed again . then the ball is taken over to an electric spin wheel , where it undergoes another high###speed scrubbing . at this point , the ball is put aside overnight . then the process is repeated twice over the next couple of days .

frankfurt , germany germany will use a newly###built world###cup base near for next year 's tournament in brazil that will allow for relatively short flights to its games . the german football###federation said friday the coastal base will be in the state of bahia , 19 miles north of porto###seguro . the base is still under construction and will consist of 14 two story houses for players and team officials . a media center and practice###field will be nearby . the base is near the village of santo andre and will be finished by march . national###team###manager oliver###bierhoff said the facility was not being built for us and according to our wishes . but the newspaper bild , which first reported the choice of base , said coach joachim loew was not happy with the hotels offered and decided on the new camp . the project is financially supported by a german entrepreneur , the federation said . the german team will fly to brazil on june 7 and prepare for the tournament at its base . germany plays portugal on june 16 in salvador , ghana on june 21 in fortaleza and the united###states on june 26 in recife . germany is seeking its fourth###world cup###title and the first since . the last major title germany won was the 1996 european###championship . after an exhibition###game against poland on may , the germans will train for 10 days at the end of may in alto adige , a german###speaking region in northern###italy . an exhibition against an undetermined opponent is scheduled for moenchengladbach on june , and another in mainz on june . germany also plays chile on march 5 in stuttgart .
bethesda , md . roberto###castro missed the u.s . open at merion . it felt as if he was playing one thursday in the at t national at congressional . the course that has hosted three u.s . opens looked as though it could hold another in a moment 's notice . only a dozen players shot in the 60s , with castro leading the way at a 5 under 66 that required some of his best golf . he made three straight birdies late in his round with a 20 foot###putt , a perfect 3 wood into a par 5 and a chip in . it 's very similar in that there 's not a lot of birdies out there , castro said . there 's not many good breaks or bad breaks to be had out there . if you drive it in the rough , you drove it in the rough . if you hit it in the fairway , you can go from there . the average score was just over , despite cloud cover for most of the day leading to soft conditions and only a light wind . billy###horschel , who tied for fourth in the real u.s . open two weeks###ago , began his day with a 50 foot###birdie###putt , added a pair of birdies over the next three holes and then hung on for a . that was the best score among the early starters . bud cauley and graham###delaet each had a 68 in the afternoon . it 's like another u.s . open , horschel said . off the fairways , the rough is thick . fortunately , the greens are soft so they 're really receptive . it 's still a tough golf course . the eight players at 69 included jim###furyk , 19 year old jordan###spieth and brandt###snedeker , whose round included a birdie on the par 5 ninth hole in which he covered more than the 635 yards it was playing . snedeker snap hooked his drive into the rough and was blocked by trees , leaving him no choice but to chip backward or play down the adjacent fourth hole . he hit hybrid down the fourth , and just his luck , wound up on the member 's tee . from about 180 yards , he hammered a 6 iron through more trees , and the big roar told him he had reached the green . from there , he made a 55 foot###birdie###putt . simple as that . kind of stealing a couple there is what it feels like , he said . davis###love###iii had an 83 with a sore hip and then withdrew , not wanting to risk further injury . rory###sabbatini withdrew with a sore back after he was 8 over in 12 holes . charlie beljan had an . lucas###glover , a former u.s . open###champion , called it the most boring round of pga###tour golf i 've###heard . i heard two cheers across the whole golf course all morning , glover said after a hard earned . they definitely were n't for my group . there were no tricks at congressional , and there certainly was no faking it . masters champion adam scott hurt himself with an ordinary day by his standards off the tee and wound up with a . hunter###mahan hit only six fairways he 's one of the best drivers in golf and shot a . officials cut the rough wednesday , though its thickness presented the bigger###problem than the height of the grass . it 's tougher than congressional was for the u.s . open two years###ago , when the course was relatively soft throughout the week . rory###mcilroy played better than anyone that week and won by eight shot at a record 16 under . this was more of a grind . castro made only one bogey , and that was from the fairway . after a weak drive , he put his second shot on the 11th into the water , and saved bogey with a chip to tap in range . he bounced back with consecutive birdies , and twice made solid par saves before his run of birdies on his back nine . but it was a quiet day for the most part . two u.s . opens in three weeks , said george###mcneill , who had a 71 while playing with jonas###blixt and ben###curtis . and before that , we got to play the u.s . open at muirfield ( village , too . it was fairly###quiet out there . you have a few cheers here and there . but we had the 'hot###dog' group . that 's where the fans are looking at the pairing sheet and go , 'curtis , blixt , mcneill . let 's go get a hot###dog . ' it did n't help that tiger###woods was n't around , unable to play because of a sore left elbow that will keep him out of competition until the british###open next month . woods won last year at 8 under , one of the higher winning scores on tour in . you do n't usually see first round scores on a pga###tour event only be 3 under leading after the morning wave , horschel said . it shows you how tough this golf course is , shows you how long the rough is . horschel , though , said he likes it that way because it does n't###feel like a putting contest . as for not having woods around ? horschel does n't look at the at t national any differently without him . tiger is tiger . he 's just another guy , horschel said . he 's just another player out there . for me , thinking about someone , how great he is , is just a distraction for me . but it is a disappointment that he 's not playing out there because obviously it is his event . the crowds love him to death , and he does spice up the event a little bit . it 's the second time in the last seven weeks that castro got off to a great start . he had a course record###tying 63 on the tpc sawgrass for a three shot lead at the players###championship , and he was n't sure which was tougher . they were totally different rounds , he said . the one at sawgrass , i hit it 3 feet eight or nine times . and the one today was more of a normal , lower round where i made some putts . it 's hard to compare these two golf###courses . that one was playing firm and fast . this one is just long and soft . divots nick###watney holed out from 148 yards with a wedge on the fourth hole for an eagle on his way to a . ... k.j . choi celebrated his birthday thursday , at least based on the korean calendar . the lunar###calendar birthday for the 43 year old was may . either way , here 's how choi counts it every year , i get shorter , he said . ... every player made at least one bogey .
washington a retired federal###judge , who formerly served on the secret foreign###intelligence###surveillance###court , on tuesday praised the growing public###discussion about government surveillance fostered by the leaks of classified###information by edward j . snowden , the former national###security###agency contractor whom the obama administration has charged with espionage and who remains a fugitive . the brouhaha after the snowden leaks and this meeting indeed establishes what i think is true that we need to have a more wide###open debate about this in our society , and thankfully we 're beginning to have the debate and this meeting is part of it , said james###robertson , formerly of the federal###district court for the district of columbia . he made his remarks during an all day workshop by the privacy and civil###liberties oversight###board , an independent agency that is trying to scrutinize surveillance in light of mr . snowden 's revelations . the workshop doubled as something of a coming out for the full five member privacy board , whose creation was recommended by the sept . 11 commission . although some of its members held a public organizational meeting last year , the senate did not confirm its full time chairman , david medine , until may , shortly before mr . snowden 's revelations began spilling out . the board has an annual###budget of , 000 and by law has access to classified###information . it plans eventually to issue a report and recommendations about whether the surveillance programs properly balance security and privacy , along with recommendations . on tuesday , its members questioned specialists about the legal , technological and policy###implications of government surveillance . the discussions focused on two areas . the first was the revelation that the n.s.a . is keeping a huge database of domestic communications metadata logs of all phone calls americans have dialed or received . the other was the new details about how the n.s.a . is carrying out authority congress granted it in 2008 to collect the contents of phone calls and e mails without any individualized court orders so long as the target is believed to be a noncitizen abroad . in one panel , two former bush###administration justice###department officials who helped###develop the current legal###basis for the activities steven g . bradbury , who led the office###of###legal###counsel in president george w . bush 's second term , and kenneth l . wainstein , who led its national###security division defended the programs as both lawful and appropriate . their view was largely echoed on a later panel by james a . baker , a former career justice###department official who represented the government before the surveillance court . mr . baker noted that the programs were approved by elements of all three branches of government , asking , how much more oversight do you want ? still , mr . baker also appeared to question the need for the 2008 law , saying that in his view the previous version of the foreign###intelligence###surveillance###act which required individual court orders for all surveillance conducted on american soil , even if the target was overseas was adequate for wartime . other panelists , including jameel jaffer of the american###civil###liberties###union and greg nojeim of the center for democracy and technology , criticized the programs . mr . nojeim said the domestic call log program in particular was unlawful and should be discontinued . the surveillance court has ruled that the domestic call log program is legally authorized by a provision of the patriot###act that allows the government to obtain business records deemed relevant to an investigation . several panelists portrayed the court 's theory as dubious , citing comments by lawmakers who said they did not intend to authorize such bulk collection in the patriot###act . but mr . wainstein said it was not uncommon for statutes enacted for one purpose to later be applied in different ways to other circumstances . the tone of the conversation was largely sober , although there were occasional moments of muted tension . at one point , mr . bradbury , who in the bush###administration signed secret legal memorandums declaring that the suffocation procedure known as waterboarding was a lawful interrogation###technique , criticized as not accurate mr . jaffer 's description of the call log program as surveillance , saying that term means content collection , not metadata collection . but mr . jaffer , seated next to mr . bradbury , replied , i think people can decide for themselves whether it 's surveillance or not , in the same way they can describe for themselves whether it 's torture or not . several panelists argued that the government should be more open about the legal interpretations it is developing about surveillance law so that there could be greater democratic accountability and public trust in the process . mr . baker , for example , suggested that congress could change the rules so that in the future , when the national###security court issues a lengthy ruling interpreting surveillance law , it would be required to produce an unclassified summary of the legal###issues for public release . judge robertson , who served on the national###security court that oversees government surveillance from 2002 until resigning in december , also criticized the surveillance court system because only the government generally submits filings to it , so judges do not benefit from adversarial debate . he suggested creating an advocate with security###clearance who would argue against government filings . and michael davidson , a former counsel to the senate###intelligence###committee , noted that the call log program must be reapproved by the surveillance court every 90 days and the overseas targeting program once a year . now that their existence is known , he argued , the board should push to allow outside groups to submit briefs to the surveillance court the next time they come up for renewal .
los###angeles buys them for 85 , 000 apiece . detroit pays 84 , 000 . closer to home , a major new york hospital system spends less than 80 , 000 . but the new york###city fire department has them all beat , spending more 133 , 000 each for custom made ambulances all 480 of them . at 65 million , the department 's new contract to replace its front line fleet over five years is the largest and most costly municipal ambulance purchase in united###states history , according to industry executives . the five year contract was approved in june and the new ambulances have begun to roll in . at a time when budget###cuts are closing firehouses , curbing daily ambulance runs and delaying construction of new emergency###medical stations , the pricey ambulance purchases raise this question what is new york getting for its money that other big###cities are not ? some of the answers are found in a thick set of specifications , drawn up by city fire and purchasing officials . manufacturers say it is the most detailed and restrictive list of specs out there , dictating everything from the placement of the tailpipe to the vehicle 's warranty . fire department officials say it ensures that new york gets a high quality###product . critics , however , say some requirements needlessly drive up costs and scare away competition , with bidding limited to those manufacturers willing to take on the risk and cost of retooling assembly lines to accommodate new york 's desires for things like specialized interior cabinet doors or reinforced step wells . some of the requirements are there at the insistence of the municipal labor###unions . further limiting the bidding is the ''aggravation factor'' of dealing with new york 's procurement bureaucracy , which frequently pays late . a result has been that one ambulance manufacturer , horton emergency###vehicles of ohio , has emerged the winning###bidder time and again , fueling talk that the city favors that company . that talk has the effect of further tamping down competition . ''everybody knows that new york buys horton ambulances , '' said battalion chief don frazeur , who oversees the vehicle###fleet for the los###angeles###fire###department . ''all the other companies drool over that contract , but it 's so proprietary they feel they do n't have a shot to get it . '' although more than a half###dozen manufacturers can build the quantity of customized ambulances sought by new york , only two , horton and american###lafrance of south###carolina , submitted###bids this year . horton 's price per vehicle beat american###lafrance , whose bid was about 150 , 000 each . a third company , wheeled coach industries of florida , the world 's largest ambulance manufacturer , took a close look at the specifications and decided not to bid . in a letter to the city , wheeled coach 's president , robert l . collins , said some of new york 's terms were ''completely unreasonable and unheard of in this industry . '' ''overall , '' mr . collins wrote , ''it is new york###city 's taxpayers that will pay the premium . in a time of severe budget###constraints , why is n't new york seeking better value rather than greater surety ? '' new york###city officials reject suggestions that they are spending too much or favor a specific manufacturer . they say they are seeking the vehicles that can best withstand a brutal working###environment , are user###friendly for city employees and can be built quickly . ''you get what you pay for , '' said assistant fire commissioner james basile , who oversees the vehicle###fleet . ''i can comfortably say that we get 10 years out of these vehicles . there are no other roads like there are in new york###city , and the vehicles we buy have to be able to withstand that . '' commissioner basile said that , besides being sturdy , new york 's ambulances are designed to make life easier for the mechanics who work on them and the emergency###medical###technicians who ride in them . he is proud of the demanding specifications , like two green indicator###lights on the outside of an ambulance that let you know when its battery has been left on . the lights were commissioner basile 's idea . ''it 's simple###things like that , no one else has , '' he said . ''who knows how much we save each year by not having batteries going dead ? '' determining why new york 's ambulances cost more is difficult , in part because the companies that bid to build them do not break out expenses for individual###items . ( several company###executives estimated that the cost of adding the green indicator###lights , a relatively small item , could add 50 , 000 to 70 , 000 to new york 's total contract price . ) comparing contracts also can be tricky . new york 's 133 , 000 contract price includes a two###way###radio system . los###angeles' contract price of 85 , 000 per vehicle does not include radios , which , when added , bring the total price to about 111 , 000 still below new york 's . detroit 's 84 , 000 contract price includes a partial radio system . san###francisco 's 98 , 000 ambulances come with a complete system . the north###shore long###island jewish health system , which operates one of the largest hospital based ambulance fleets in the country and responds to emergencies in parts of new york###city , pays less than 80 , 000 for ambulances without radios . when radios and other equipment are added , the cost tops 100 , 000 , said brian###o'neill , the health system 's vice###president for emergency###services . mr . o'neill said the ambulances he buys are built with a van###chassis , as opposed to the more expensive pickup###truck chassis favored by the fire department , which says the cab 's extended nose better protects occupants in a crash . other fire departments argue that the van design reduces the likelihood of collisions because its flattened nose allows for greater field of vision and a tighter turning###radius . that debate is moot in new york###city , however . the firefighters' union has made it clear that it favors the truck design , which some company###executives say could add as much as 1 million to the city 's total contract price . ''when i buy ambulances , i do n't have to deal with the union , '' mr . o'neill said . ''if their union makes something a safety issue , then you ca n't###fight it . '' new york fire officials said that in addition to promoting safety , their specifications had the practical benefit of ensuring that every ambulance is built exactly the same way , making spare###parts interchangeable . but they insist they are not wedded to horton , which has been building ambulances for new york since at least the early 1980 's . ''over 20 years , we have evolved a spec that works for us , '' said anthony demaio , the assistant###deputy director of fleet services . ''anyone has the opportunity to build it for us as long as it is to that spec . '' when other companies tried to build ambulances for new york###city in recent###years , they did not get far . in 1998 , the city postponed plans to buy 400 ambulances after accusations from potential bidders that the specifications favored horton . for example , one competitor said the fire department 's vehicle design required rounded###corner posts and y shaped braces made by horton but not by other companies . after the city revised its specifications and put the contract out to bid again in 1999 , another company , mccoy miller of indiana , won with a low bid of 110 , 000 per vehicle . but the department soon complained that mccoy miller was struggling to meet its production schedule , and that some vehicles were of poor###quality . the company tried to mitigate those concerns by offering a 10 , 000 discount on each vehicle , but the city canceled the contract . to pick up the slack left by the cancellation , the fire department awarded emergency no bid contracts for 50 ambulances each to horton and wheeled coach . however , wheeled coach backed out after the department found problems with a prototype ambulance it produced and refused to relax what the company considered insignificant yet time consuming design requirements . for instance , the department decided it wanted colored wiring instead of black , and a single exhaust tailpipe instead of two , wheeled coach said in a letter to the city . specifications for double###doors on a rear storage###compartment were changed to a single door , and detailed requirements were added for the type of threaded fastener to be used to mount the vehicle 's warning###lights . ''the specifications do not describe warning light mounting , '' the company said in its letter , and ''this adds###additional material and cost . '' a spokesman for wheeled coach declined to comment on the company 's dealings with new york###city . horton dismissed the complaints as sour grapes . david lamon , horton 's vice###president for sales and marketing , said new york 's specifications did not favor his company , and that any advantage horton may have comes from its long history of building ambulances for the department . ''we have more of an understanding of the demands of their system , what their problems are , what their needs are , '' mr . lamon said . still , ''they are a very difficult contract for us to do because it is so different . '' mr . demaio said wheeled coach was a chronic complainer that ''wants to build the vehicles its way , and not our way . '' other fire departments , including los###angeles' , say they have found wheeled coach cooperative and willing to accommodate their specifications . ''wheeled coach is like buying a chevrolet , '' said chief frazeur , the los###angeles battalion leader . ''there are some more expensive###cars out there , while others might not get you back and forth in as much comfort . it 's hard to contrast quality and value , but there 's a middle###ground there somewhere . '' correction october 23 , 2003 , thursday an article on tuesday about the custom made ambulances purchased by the new york###city fire department misidentified the union that has a hand in shaping the bid specifications . it is the one representing emergency###medical###technicians , not firefighters .
orders for long lasting manufactured###goods surged in november and a gauge of planned business spending on capital goods recorded its largest increase in nearly a year , pointing to sustained strength in the american economy . while another report on tuesday showed new home sales slipped in november , sales in october were revised to show the highest pace in more than five years . in addition , house###prices rebounded , underscoring the economy 's improving fundamentals . we are coming out of the shadows of the great###recession in many ways , said robert a . dye , chief economist at comerica in dallas . the commerce###department said durable###goods orders jumped . 5 percent last month as demand###increased for a range of goods , including aircraft , machinery , and computers and electronic products . the increase , which outpaced economists' expectations for a 2 percent rise , more than reversed a drop in october . excluding transportation , orders recorded their largest gain in six months . nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft , a closely###watched proxy for business spending plans , surged . 5 percent . the increase snapped two straight months of declines and was the largest advance since january . the increases in these so called core capital goods orders and in durable###goods orders over all suggested strength in manufacturing and were further evidence of a firming economic###growth outlook . they narrow the gap with sentiment surveys that have offered a more upbeat view of manufacturing than government data . sentiments were showing things were good but not the hard numbers . things seemed to have turned now , said sam bullard , a senior economist at wells###fargo securities in charlotte , n.c . businesses going into 2014 are more confident in their outlook . from consumer###spending to employment and trade , the foundations appear to be in place for sustained and strong###economic###growth in . in a second report , the commerce###department said new home sales fell . 1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual###rate of , 000 units . october 's sales , however , were revised to a , 000 unit pace , the highest###level since july . despite the fall , home sales retained the bulk of the previous###month 's . 6 percent increase . the durable###goods report showed that shipments of core capital goods , which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government 's measure of gross###domestic###product , increased . 8 percent last month . that was the largest rise since march , prompting economists at goldman###sachs to raise their fourth###quarter g.d.p . estimate by a tenth of a percentage###point to a.4 percent annual###rate . shipments had dropped in september and october . manufacturing is being bolstered by the housing###market recovery , through demand for building###materials and household###appliances . home resales momentum has , however , slowed somewhat since the summer because of higher mortgage rates .
in previous###seasons the mets have had attractive trade chips heading toward the july 31 deadline . but after having gutted the team of most of its high###priced players , the mets will have little to offer this summer . if , as expected , they refuse to offer closer bobby parnell in a trade , the most likely player to be dealt could be the starter shaun###marcum . the notion that marcum would have any trade value might seem ludicrous . he entered monday 's game with a . 08 earned###run###average and a 1 9 record . he has been on the verge of losing his spot in the rotation since zack wheeler 's promotion from the minors , and he is scheduled to make 4 million this season . yet in six starts before monday , marcum 's e.r.a . was . 05 , and batters were hitting . 231 with a . 643 on base plus slugging###percentage . additionally , he had struck out 35 in 40 innings . certainly marcum is no ace , but he could be an affordable option for a team looking for a back of the rotation starter . marcum 's six innings on monday in the mets' , 13 inning win over the arizona###diamondbacks are n't likely to discourage any teams from at least continuing to monitor the right hander . although he did not dominate , he recovered after allowing three earned###runs in the first two innings to record a quality###start . in his final four innings , marcum allowed two hits . he was saved from his 10th loss of the season when the mets rallied with a run in the ninth against j . j . putz to tie the diamondbacks , 3 3 . the mets won on andrew###brown 's two run single in the 13th off reliever josh collmenter , who had loaded the bases on a double and two intentional###walks . mets reliever david###aardsma got the victory , his first of the season , despite allowing a homer by cody###ross in the top of the 13th . after brown 's single , collmenter slammed his glove to the ground while brown raised his arms in celebration after rounding first base . the game was played against the constant threat of rain . the field was covered in the early###afternoon and neither team took batting practice . the skies were gray for most of the night , and at one point appeared to turn purple . but the heavy###rain stayed away . the mets had numerous scoring###opportunities against starter wade###miley but could not break through . they loaded the bases in the first , and had runners on second and third with one out in the second . in the sixth , josh satin hit a leadoff double and moved to third on a wild###pitch . but miley struck out john###buck one of catcher 's three strikeouts on the night and juan lagares . after miley walked shortstop omar quintanilla , arizona manager kirk###gibson brought in reliever brad###ziegler , who struck out pinch###hitter kirk nieuwenhuis to end the inning . the mets finally###scored in the seventh on a single by david###wright , which drove in eric###young jr . , and added a run in the eighth when young 's double scored quintanilla . in the ninth , marlon###byrd nearly tied the score when his long drive landed inches from clearing the left center###field###fence . but he scored the tying run minutes later on a single by satin . ruben tejada , on the disabled###list with a right quadriceps strain , will continue his rehabilitation stint in class###aaa las###vegas after having successfully played nine pain free innings on monday for class a port st . lucie . tejada was 2 for 4 with an r.b.i . for port st . lucie . i want him to have some success , manager terry###collins said . when he was here , he was struggling . in order to come back , you 've got to have some confidence in what you 're doing . so i want him to go down there and have some success , so when it 's time to come back here , his game is where it belongs and where he feels good about it . ... the mets and the diamondbacks honored the 19 firefighters killed while battling a wildfire in yarnell , ariz . , with a moment of silence before the game . additionally , the teams hung no . 19 team jerseys in their respective dugouts with the word yarnell stitched on them .
london and then there were two . the final###game in the confederations###cup on sunday comes down to spain , the best team in the world , against brazil , the best in history , in the maracan , unquestionably one of the most evocative soccer stadiums on earth . even if we separate the sport from the uprising in the streets , this world###cup rehearsal has been a tough tournament . and , as host###nations invariably do in modern###times , brazil has made sure its most feared opponent took the longest and most tortuous road to the final . the semifinals brazil versus uruguay , and spain versus italy looked almost like exercises in organized exhaustion . brazil 's winning###goal came very late , from the head of paulinho following a corner###kick in the final###moments . the wily uruguayan coach scar tab rez said he had listened some months###ago to the brazilian director of coaching , carlos###alberto###parreira , lecturing on how to frustrate the flow of barcelona 's tika taka game by outnumbering its pass masters in midfield . so uruguay applied that pressure to brazil in belo###horizonte on wednesday###evening . then on thursday , italy switched its formation to three at the back , five in midfield , and not only did it deny xavi hernandez , andr###s###iniesta and company the freedom to express themselves , it was often italy that sprang , and alas spurned , the greater scoring###opportunities . on and on it went , this second semifinal . italy 's game plan might well have broken the spaniards' world###record run of 29 competitive###matches without defeat . but italy , without the injured mario balotelli , ran out of steam in the equatorial heat and humidity up in fortaleza . the italians wore###black###armbands , and most would have known personally the former national###team###player stefano###borgonovo , who died earlier thursday from motor###neuron###disease at the age of . but italy gave everything , the team running itself to a standstill in a scoreless two hours that , finally , had to be settled by the excruciating penalty###shootout lottery . exhausted players stepping up one by one , holding nerve and sinew together for one last shot . goalkeepers who could be hero or fall###guy or , in this instance , simply unable to reach any of the first dozen kicks that were planted with remarkable consistency too high or too low to be saved . and then poor leonardo###bonucci , a defender whose primary###purpose is to keep the ball out of his net , had the misfortune to be 13th in line . his nerve failed , his aim was high and woeful and over the bar . after him , jes s navas stepped up with a forward 's aim to slot the ball low inside the post###game and semifinal to the spaniards . from that , we learned that despite all it has won being world###and###european###champion , spain still has the deep###desire to go all the way even in a hot climate in effectively a mere warmup for next year 's world###cup . brazilian fans jeered the spanish on every field , which smacks of envy . when the players' rooms were entered and valuables stolen while spain played an earlier match , the local###media suggested that the victims had made the whole thing up . the spanish team under its experienced###coach , vicente###del###bosque , is not noted for seeking excuses . indeed , it is so long now , three years and counting , that spain has lost a meaningful contest that it would be ludicrous to complain . nevertheless , its journey to sunday 's last game puts it at a disadvantage . spain played its semifinal in fortaleza , in the north of the country , a , 200 kilometer , or , 400 mile , flight to rio de janeiro , where the final is scheduled . brazil 's match against uruguay in belo###horizonte was about a sixth of the distance away , and played 24 hours###earlier , giving the host a full day extra to rest and recuperate . and time is of the essence , as everyone who plays in the real###thing next year will appreciate and learn . howard###webb , the english referee for the spain vs . italy match , had shed three kilograms , or nearly seven pounds , in weight per game keeping up with the players . weight###loss and proper scientific recovery is obviously part and parcel of a top sportsman 's lot . the teams are prepared for every eventuality , and , in brazil 's case , this rehearsal is the closest###thing to competitive circumstances that the players will experience between now and their world###cup . this team has to face a lot of difficulties , said luiz###felipe###scolari , brazil 's head###coach . we achieved our goal of getting to the final and giving the players a sense of unity . we have one more objective now , to win this final and to show the fans that we have a good team for the world###cup . scolari is as pragmatic now as he was back in , when he took brazil to the winning post at the world###cup in south###korea and japan . he fostered then a unity , a hard###core of reliable competitors , some of whom he gradually allowed to express their individuality . his star then was ronaldo . it looks now as if neymar , the 21 year old who has just been sold by santos to barcelona , is his match winner . but scolari , who resumed as coach of the national###team is no fool . the coach has been there and done it . he knows that spain has the best collection of individuals , and the most proven game plan , possibly ever . brazil is not a match for that , or for its own wonderful sides of 1958 and . a month ago , scolari suffered the taunts of brazilian fans calling him donkey , donkey . we are young , the coach said before this final . we struggle a little when it 's a different game . the 2002 team was much more prepared , we had six players who had been to the previous world###cup . today , we have two or three from the last world###cup . we have a lot to learn about playing with calm . there is nothing like a match to help you mature . a match in a final , against the team no one in the world has figured out how to beat over the past three years .
los###angeles it seemed inevitable that sean###miller would end up here , with a permanent home underneath hollywood 's bright###lights , where his prodigious childhood talent for dribbling and handling a basketball drew the attention of film and movie types . alas , miller 's big###screen career###lasted a handful of seconds , just one scene in which he dribbled three basketballs at once as the actor nicholas###pryor walked by and asked , how tall is your mother ? it is true , though . before miller became a basketball coach , before he took over at arizona , before he guided the wildcats into the round of , there was the fish that saved pittsburgh . released in , the film became something of a cult###classic . strangers ask gary stromberg , one of its producers , about it all the time . he heard shaquille###o'neal once ranked it among his favorite###movies . same with donovan###mcnabb . i remember that kid from the movie , stromberg said this week in a telephone interview . i did n't know that was sean###miller until just now . i had no idea he became a coach . that miller landed beneath these bright###lights anyway , with his wildcats pitted against ohio###state in a west region semifinal thursday , is a direct result of his childhood experiences and his father 's influence in particular . john###miller coached for nearly 30 years in beaver###falls , pa . , where he won nearly 600 games at blackhawk high###school and 4 state titles . by the time his children could walk , miller had set up a basket in the basement , complete with a wooden backboard , an 18 inch rim and some 40 pages of drills , everything from dribbling to jump rope . you knew basketball was important in our house , said archie miller , sean 's younger###brother and the head###coach at dayton . it was basically the same as breathing . very , very few people have outworked my brother in the game of basketball . and i mean from age 5 to . from this basketball incubator , sean###miller dribbled . everywhere he went , he dribbled . he dribbled to his friends' houses , around the neighborhood , into restaurants . he learned to dribble while he spun a ball on an index###finger , or pulled it around his back . he jumped rope as he spun balls with one finger on each hand . he was a puppet master . the ball was his puppet . this led to more than 15 minutes of attention . miller performed all over the country , at halftime shows , for the pittsburgh###steelers , even on the tonight###show###starring###johnny###carson . he once signed an autograph for john###wooden . somehow , miller 's dribbling came to the attention of bo###ryan at wisconsin , then an assistant###coach . ryan , an economics and marketing major , wanted to spice up the university 's basketball camp . so he flew in three basketball magicians , miller , the youngest of the three , included . as part of his routine , miller wore a superman costume . those were the three best at the time , ryan said in a telephone interview . probably in the world . in the '80s , there were all these kids whose dad took them to the gym for 10 hours a day , all these instructional###videos . but sean is the one that people from my generation remember . around that time , stromberg was a producer of the movie car###wash , which earned him some hollywood credibility . he and his partner wrote the fish in one night , which stromberg , who has been a recovering drug###addict for about 30 years , said was fueled by cocaine . we used a lot of drugs that night , he said . got very high . and laughed a lot . they managed to land julius###erving for the lead role . ( stromberg said he once saw dr . j doing his own laundry on set in pittsburgh . ) the movie , a mixture of sports and fantasy , told of a struggling basketball franchise that tried to right its season by building a team around players with the same astrological###sign ( pisces . neither the movie nor miller 's stint as a ball handling prodigy is listed in his bio on the arizona athletics' web###site . the topic , in fact , is among his least favorite .

affirmative###action 's contentious history sam###tanenhaus on the history of affirmative###action , a program that dates back to the presidency of john f . kennedy and has stirred debate for decades . washington courts must take a skeptical look at affirmative###action programs at public###colleges###and###universities , the supreme###court ruled monday , in a decision that is likely to set off a wave of challenges to race conscious admissions###policies nationwide . the 7 to 1 decision avoided giving a direct###answer about the constitutionality of the program , used by the university of texas at austin , that was before the court . the program will continue for now , but the justices ordered an appeals###court to reconsider the case under a demanding standard that appears to jeopardize the program . the ruling was simultaneously modest and significant , and its recalibration of how courts review the constitutionality of race conscious decisions by the government will reverberate beyond higher###education . the brief decision , issued eight months after the case was argued , was almost surely the product of intense negotiations among the justices . the compromise that the majority reached was at least a reprieve for affirmative###action in higher###education , and civil###rights groups that had feared for the future of race conscious admission programs were relieved . conservatives and other opponents of the current###version of affirmative###action vowed to use the court 's ruling as a road###map to bring future cases . justice anthony m . kennedy wrote the majority###opinion , joined by the four members of the court 's conservative wing chief###justice john g . roberts jr . and justices antonin###scalia , clarence###thomas and samuel a . alito jr . and two of its liberals , justices stephen g . breyer and sonia###sotomayor . only justice ruth###bader###ginsburg dissented , writing that lower###courts were correct to uphold the texas program . justice elena###kagan disqualified herself from the case , presumably because she had worked on it as solicitor###general in the obama administration . the decision did not disturb the supreme###court 's general approach to affirmative###action in admissions decisions , saying that educational diversity is an interest sufficient to overcome the general ban on racial classifications by the government . but the court added that public###institutions must have good reasons for the particular methods they use to achieve that goal . colleges and universities , justice###kennedy wrote for the majority , must demonstrate that available , workable race neutral alternatives do not suffice before taking account of race in admissions decisions . that requirement could endanger the texas program when it is reconsidered by the united###states court of appeals for the fifth circuit , in new orleans . the university 's program admits most undergraduates under race neutral criteria , accepting all texas students who graduate near the top of their high###school classes . but the university also uses a race conscious system to choose the remaining students . courts reviewing government programs that make distinctions based on race subject them to a form of judicial###review known as strict###scrutiny , requiring the government to identify an important goal and a close fit between means and ends . justice###kennedy 's opinion focused on and tightened the second part of the test . strict###scrutiny , justice###kennedy wrote , does not permit a court to accept a school 's assertion that its admissions###process uses race in a permissible way without a court giving close analysis to the evidence of how the process works in practice . courts reviewing affirmative###action programs must , he wrote , verify that it is necessary for a university to use race to achieve the educational###benefits of diversity . that requires , he said , a careful judicial###inquiry into whether a university could achieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifications . justice###ginsburg , who announced her dissent from the bench , said the race neutral part of the texas program worked only because of de facto racial###segregation in texas' neighborhoods and schools . the case , fisher v . university of texas , no . 11 345 , arose from a lawsuit filed by a white woman , abigail fisher , who said the university had denied her admission based on her race . in a statement issued monday , ms . fisher said she was grateful to the justices for moving the nation closer to the day when a student 's race is n't used at all in college###admissions .
brussels a panel of european###union lawmakers on monday###night backed a measure that could require american companies like google and yahoo to seek clearance from european officials before complying with united###states warrants seeking private data . the vote , by an influential committee at the european###parliament , is part of efforts in europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of revelations about a far reaching spying program by the national###security###agency of the united###states . the legislation has been under consideration for two years . the panel , meeting in strasbourg , france , also endorsed ways of tightening other privacy rules , including fines that could run to billions of euros on the biggest technology companies if they fail to adhere to rules like limiting the sharing of personal###data . the measure , if accepted by europe , is expected to face fierce lobbying from american officials and technology companies . the legislation would still require the approval of governments and the full european###parliament . this evening 's vote is a breakthrough for data###protection in europe and would overhaul e.u . rules , ensuring they are up to the task of the challenges in the digital age , said jan philipp albrecht , a german member of the committee on civil###liberties , justice and home###affairs . mr . albrecht , who is steering the legislation through the european###parliament , added that the committee had voted to make clear that it is exclusively e.u . law that applies to e.u . citizens' private data online regardless of where the business processing their data has its seat . timothy kirkhope , a british member of the committee , said before the vote , a more principles based and less prescriptive regulation would have been a better outcome . after the vote , groups representing the technology industry pressed european leaders to oppose some of the measures . john###higgins , the director general of digitaleurope , which represents companies including apple , microsoft and i.b.m. , criticized the measure and urged member states to look critically at it . rushing through a half###baked law risks throwing away a vital and much needed opportunity to stimulate economic###growth , he said . under current drafts of the legislation , fines would run as high as 100 million###euros , ( 137 million ) or 5 percent of a company 's global annual###revenue , whichever is higher , rather than a cap of 2 percent , which was the figure proposed by viviane###reding , the european###commissioner for justice , who wrote the original draft of the legislation . lawmakers want to pass the final bill before spring , partly to burnish their chances of success in european###parliament elections in may . that timetable is strongly###supported by ms . reding . european leaders are expected to meet in brussels on thursday and focus their discussions on using technology to drive economic###growth and create###jobs . a document circulated before the meeting also indicated that leaders planned to acknowledge a need to foster the trust of consumers and businesses in the digital###economy . the committee###vote on monday###night , which mr . albrecht said had been delayed twice since april by intense lobbying , gives mr . albrecht a mandate to begin negotiating the final legislation with the european###council , the body representing member governments . two years###ago , washington successfully###lobbied europe to abandon a similar measure that would have shielded europeans from requests by american authorities to share online data gathered by some of the biggest american internet companies , many of whose users live in europe . for technology companies , the concern about the pending legislation is likely to focus more on the high fines for infractions , and on restrictions on sharing personal###data that could limit their ability to gain revenue from advertising and offering new services .

washington the senate republican leader , mitch###mcconnell , made clear on sunday that he would oppose any effort by the obama administration to raise more tax revenue and that he remained focused on finding###ways to cut spending as the government grapples with its debt . the tax issue is finished , mr . mcconnell said on the abc###news program this week . over . completed . that 's behind us . mr . mcconnell 's interviews on three sunday###morning programs came just days after he and vice###president joseph r . biden jr . helped broker a resolution to the latest fiscal###crisis and as washington braced for a series of confrontations over debt and spending . mr . mcconnell 's stance on taxes countered calls from democrats , and even some house republicans , to revamp the tax###code to close some provisions and raise new revenue . but mr . mcconnell did say he would favor changes if they were revenue neutral , meaning that lower rates would be paid for by limiting deductions and closing loopholes . mr . mcconnell 's focus on the need for spending###cuts was relentless in his interviews on abc , nbc and cbs . he was equally insistent that president###obama must take the lead on fiscal plans . his remarks stood in contrast to comments from the senate 's no . 2 democrat , richard j . durbin of illinois , who said on the cnn program state of the union that there was plenty of room to increase###revenue by examining deductions , credits , special treatments under the tax###code . mr . mcconnell 's position also contrasted with remarks on saturday by mr . obama , who said in his weekly address that he remained###open to both spending###cuts and further tax increases . the fiscal agreement last week made tax###cuts permanent for most households and put off big###spending cuts . mr . obama , who was speaking from hawaii before returning to washington on sunday , emphasized his own line in the sand . now that the government has reached its statutory borrowing limit , mr . obama said , congress had no choice but to raise it to avoid a damaging default . he said the matter was not up for negotiation . if congress refuses to give the united###states the ability to pay its bills on time , the consequences for the entire global###economy could be catastrophic , mr . obama said . our families and our businesses cannot afford that dangerous###game again . mr . mcconnell repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether he supported republican###senators who have suggested that a default and even a brief shutdown of the government might be necessary to secure deep spending###cuts . my answer is hopefully we do n't need to get to that point , he said on abc . the president surely must know we 're spending way too much . so why do n't we do something about reducing spending ? mr . mcconnell also suggested that other obama administration priorities , including a new push for gun restrictions after the connecticut school###shooting , might have to wait . mr . mcconnell was asked about reports that mr . biden , whom mr . obama charged with developing proposals to address gun###violence , had confidently predicted the passage of gun###control legislation this month . mr . mcconnell seemed to cast cold###water on that notion . the biggest###problem we have at the moment is spending and debt , he said . that 's going to dominate the congress between now and the end of march . none of these issues , i think , will have the kind of priority that spending and debt will have .
london as the british fashion###retailer burberry lost angela ahrendts , its star chief###executive , to apple on tuesday , christopher bailey , the company 's multitasking digitally skilled designer , stepped up to take her place . together , ms . ahrendts , an american , and mr . bailey , an englishman , created the dynamic that took the distinctive burberry plaid , a 157 year old brand once seen mainly in the lining of military inspired trench coats , into fashion hot###spots as well as onto facebook and twitter . burberry was called the world 's most digitally competent luxury###brand last year by luxurylab , a research group affiliated with new york###university . harvard###business###review singled out ms . ahrendts for her digital innovation . as for mr . bailey , a 42 year old design director , a profile of him in 2011 in american vogue called him a pioneer of all things digital in the fashion industry . last year he was given the title of chief###creative###officer , which recognized his broad role at the company as merchandiser , brand manager , information###technology officer and e###commerce innovator . his emphasis on digital in design as well as marketing has been heralded as the new exemplar for the fashion industry . investors were among those dazzled by the results . in , the year before ms . ahrendts took over , burberry had revenue of . 9 million . last year , it was about 2 billion , or about 3 billion . burberry stock , which was trading at about . 30 when she took over , closed at . 85 in london on monday , before her departure was announced on tuesday . as a sign that investors see ms . ahrendts as a hard act to follow , burberry shares fell more than 5 percent at the opening of trading in london on tuesday###morning , before closing down more than . 6 percent , at . 64 ( 23 . 42 ) . the appointment of mr . bailey to what would appear to be two full time roles came as a surprise . but the burberry chairman , john peace , said in the statement that he was confident that mr . bailey 's vision and leadership would see him through . mr . bailey , who joined burberry in , said he felt privileged to have the new responsibility . but virginie blin , an analyst at alphavalue in paris , said i 'm astounded by the idea that someone could be simultaneously the c.e.o . and artistic###director of burberry . it 's too much for one man . the loss of ms . ahrendts is destabilizing , ms . blin said , especially after stacey cartwright left as burberry 's chief###financial###officer in july to , according to the company , pursue new interests . it still declines to elaborate on her departure . mr . bailey , along with ms . ahrendts and ms . cartwright , had formed the trio that brought about the recovery and the exceptionally###strong growth of the group , ms . blin said . she said his promotion represented continuity with a successful past . nicola ko , an analyst at ledbury research in london , saw many reasons to be positive . it 's almost like her work is done and the strategy is in place now , ms . ko said . definitely there 's going to be a massive workload for mr . bailey , and that 's negative . but he 's been working###closely with her , and he 's been at burberry for more than 10 years , so he knows the business inside out . burberry on tuesday also reported strong###results for the first half of its financial year . it said sales rose 17 percent , to 694 million , in the six months through sept . 30 , in line with expectations . burberry , ms . ko said , was doing well in comparison with rivals like kering and lvmh mo t hennessy louis###vuitton , which have posted only single###digit revenue gains . ms . ahrendts , in a statement issued by burberry , described the company as in brilliant shape , having converted the business to a dynamic digital global retailer , created a world###class supply###chain and state of the art technology infrastructure . the recent ascent by burberry followed years of failure as an underperforming british brand that had handed control , particularly in asia , to licensees and franchises . rose###marie bravo was the first american executive , coming from saks###fifth###avenue in . she hired mr . bailey and put the company in a stronger position before leaving in . mr . bailey , hailing from yorkshire , england , has a global outlook . he first met ms . ahrendts , 52 , when they worked together in the mid 1990s in new york at donna###karan . by shifting burberry 's image to a youthful style , but one that never jettisoned the core clothing lines , the brand was repositioned as affordable luxury . whether with its handbags , umbrellas with the heads of country animals , or dresses worthy of wear by young british movie stars , burberry became hip and desirable . the black , red and brown plaid was still there , but the clothes , like mini dresses modeled by kate###moss or emma###watson , had shape and the accessories used new materials like alligator . mr . bailey even created a line of burberry fragrances for whom he described as the burberry girl . the label got much of its attention because under mr . bailey 's direction it was eager to embrace marketing in new digital###media . it streamed a fashion show of its new collection live and also provided the online audience with an additional close up display of accessories from all angles . items could be ordered directly from its site a week later with delivery within two months . burberry has become over the last five years the most wired fashion brand in its sector , with technology in the forefront of its brand strategy , building a commanding###position on facebook and other social###media and creating a seamless connection from its online###marketplace to collecting in store . at the company 's hyperwired headquarters , on horseferry road in london , all employees are provided with smartphones and tablets . i like the idea of this incredibly fast , digitalized world but it is important to make something that is real clothing , bags and shoes , mr . bailey said at a fashion show in . the new marketing efforts have enabled the company to reduce its reliance on wholesale sales to department###stores as its own stores sprout up across the world and , in particular china . it terminated franchise agreements there , where products were sometimes displayed in shoddy stores , and set up its own shops in major###cities and then expanded into smaller###cities as well .
the houston###astros arrived in the bronx on monday with the worst###record in the american###league , losers of four straight###games and playing in a manner befitting a 26 million payroll . but a###funny###thing###happened that night . playing their first game at yankee###stadium as an a.l . team , the astros trounced the yankees , 9 1 , looking far better against a team with a payroll more than eight times as big . flukes happen in professional sports , particularly in baseball , in which teams###play 162 games over six months . one strange game could be dismissed as a statistical anomaly . but for the yankees , losing a second would have been unthinkable . so they took the field tuesday###night under pressure to wipe away the sting of monday 's loss and restore a semblance of order . it was not artful , but the yankees performed their duty , beating the astros , 7 4 , and breathing a sigh###of###relief that they had not dropped two in a row to a team that could wind up with the worst###record in baseball . still , the yankees must win the series###finale wednesday to avoid losing a series to a team with a winning###percentage under . 300 . the astros fell to 8 19 and have dropped 13 of their last 17 games . that 's not the best team , but it 's baseball and sometimes you lose , said eduardo nunez , who had three hits tuesday , including two doubles . it was important to win this game . we have to win every game , that is in our mind . the yankees improved to 16 10 as starter hiroki###kuroda overcame a shaky###start and a slew of base###runners to pitch seven scoreless###innings and boost his record to 4 1 with a . 25 earned###run###average . once again kuroda had difficulty mastering some pitches and had to tinker and experiment to make his way through the game . mechanical###issues with his windup contributed to putting runners on third base in each of the first three innings until the pitching coach larry rothschild suggested he abandon the windup all together . that is something that i actually do n't like doing , kuroda said through his interpreter , but i followed his suggestions and it worked out well . the astros finally###scored when chris###carter hit a two run homer off dave###robertson in the eighth . the yankees came back with three in the bottom of the inning , the first coming on lyle###overbay 's fourth home###run , and took a 7 2 lead . in the ninth shawn kelley gave up two runs on jose altuve 's double , prompting manager joe###girardi to call upon mariano###rivera , who got the final out for his 10th save in 10 opportunities , and the yankees closed out april with a respectable 16 10 mark . players such as overbay and travis###hafner , who had three hits and three runs batted in , have played###significant###roles , along with vernon###wells and , of course , robinson cano . in the absence of derek###jeter , alex###rodriguez , curtis###granderson and mark###teixeira , the yankees have held firm and pleased their manager . they have done a very good job for us , girardi said . it has n't always been pretty . but our guys have come up with clutch hits when we needed them and our pitchers have done a pretty good job . the coaches have contributed , as well . it was rothschild 's suggestion , after all , that may have prevented kuroda from enduring the same meltdown that andy###pettitte experienced on monday , and it was the hitting instructor kevin long who noticed that nunez was standing too upright at the plate , and got him to spread his legs to create more power . even against a team like the lowly astros , sometimes it is necessary to find alternative paths to victory . the yankees had just come off a four game sweep of the blue###jays , and they felt it was important to maintain their upward trajectory , especially against a struggling###team . i think it 's important , especially after the weekend we had , girardi said . you want to keep the momentum going , finish the month off well . you want to keep playing good baseball . i thought it was important . kevin###youkilis was placed on the 15 day disabled###list with a lumbar###spine strain . after youkilis said on saturday that he felt fine and then reinjured his back , joe###girardi was asked if he might ask him twice the next time . i might ask him six more times , girardi said . ... mark###teixeira , who is recovering from a strained right wrist , has not started hitting balls off a tee yet , girardi said . ... brennan###boesch said he had left his agent , scott###boras , and returned to his old agent , brodie van###wagenen of creative###artists .
columbus , ohio ohio###state football fans always want to defeat what they call that school up north . so when a 12 year old buckeyes fan was diagnosed###with###cancer 14 months###ago , he chose to name his disease michigan . he wanted to beat it and he has . the young fan , grant reed , was released from nationwide children 's hospital in columbus friday after receiving a final chemotherapy session . grant 's father , troy reed , on tuesday said his son was readmitted to the hospital over the weekend because of a bacterial infection , but he added the boy is doing very well . our prognosis is very good , he said . it shows that he has indeed beat michigan . in may , grant underwent a 16 1 2 hour surgery to have a brain###tumor removed . although the surgery was successful , he woke up without being able to move his left side or speak and had a serious vision problem . he spent nearly 10 weeks at the hospital following the surgery . he then went through occupational and speech therapies and was able to continue to attend###school . he will be in seventh###grade this fall . but his road to recovery included several rounds of radiation and chemotherapy treatments . grant 's first chemo session , his dad said , was during the buckeyes' season opening game in september . we had a mini party and watched the buckeyes play here at the hospital , troy reed said tuesday while grant was back at the hospital . he added that the reeds continued to watch osu games at the hospital during the weekends that grant was admitted to continue his chemotherapy treatment . buckeyes head###coach urban###meyer visited the boy at the hospital in december . grant 's father said his son talked to meyer for about 20 minutes . he was thrilled , the father said . grant 's parents met as members of the ohio###state marching###band and got engaged during a game in . troy reed said grant and his 9 year old brother collin have a true respect for the rivalry that osu and michigan share . troy reed said the family is hoping to attend a game during this year 's season , provided that grant 's health allows them .

one of the more interesting crime###dramas currently on either side of the atlantic started with a concept that was only about three decades old . called scott###bailey , it 's a police###procedural about two female crime solvers . or , in the words of suranne###jones , who stars in the series and came up with the original###idea with her fellow actress sally###lindsay , it 's a manchester based 'cagney###lacey . ' set in that british city 's decaying landscape , scott###bailey views every dead###body or sullen perp through the eyes of the detective constables rachel bailey ( ms . jones ) and janet scott ( lesley###sharp , who stepped into the role when ms . lindsay , who occasionally shows up as bailey 's sister , became pregnant with twins . yet it 's not hard to spot the pages that have been torn from the cagney###lacey handbook both dramas have tough###minded , emotionally complicated odd couples at their center , female cops who are different in temperament but who share a deep understanding of each other 's lives and who endlessly hash things out in stolen ladies' room moments . cagney ( sharon###gless ) was single and more glamorous than her partner , lacey ( tyne###daly , the wife of a contractor . bailey is an unmarried###woman in her 30s who binge drinks and has impulse###control issues her partner is a levelheaded 40 something mother of two . but the earlier show , which began in , had been off the air for 23 years when ms . jones and ms . lindsay hatched their idea over a bottle of wine . both were facing that strange age netherworld that most actresses are consigned to in their 30s and 40s the wife of , sidekick to , mother of , mistress to marginal parts , as ms . jones put it . so the two sketched starring###roles with heft for themselves . sally###wainwright , who created scott###bailey with diane taylor , a former homicide detective , fleshed out their idea for the british network itv in ways that make it feel modern . more often than not , the cases assigned to the syndicate 9 homicide unit involve crimes affecting women a serial###rapist on a murder spree , the strangling of a pregnant teenage bride , an actress in x rated###films who kills her husband or are told from a woman 's point of view . and in place of the barking white male in charge of seemingly every squad room in television , the team reports to a by the books detective###chief###inspector named gill murray ( amelia###bullmore . there have been other members of gill murray 's club law###order had lt . anita###van###buren ( s . epatha merkerson ) at the top , and chief###superintendent jean innocent ( rebecca front ) calls the shots on the british procedural inspector lewis , a spinoff of inspector###morse . but what makes murray loosely inspired by ms . taylor a dynamics changer is that her authority is absolute no male###or###female officer is keen on being called into her office . when ms . wainwright first started###working on scott###bailey she knew she wanted to create a universe a step beyond the woman against the boys' club construct that undergirded previous shows like prime###suspect ( starring helen###mirren ) or the closer ( starring kyra###sedgwick . the idea was to dramatize a situation , she said , in which it was perfectly acceptable to be a woman and high powered in an interesting job and it goes uncommented upon because you 're surrounded by women who are doing a similar caliber of job . reviewers in britain applauded . who knew that letting your female leads behave as actual women when confronted with hideous crimes and disastrous relationships could prove so watchable ? the guardian said of the series , which it called genuinely gripping . but there was grumbling that with such a female###perspective ( ms . wainwright and ms . taylor write the scripts , and nicola shindler is executive###producer , the males came off as buffoonish . at home , at work , they 're either evil sexist pigs and homophobes , or dull brainless snoring twits , the guardian complained of the male portrayals , adding , could n't there be just one reasonable male###character ? i kind of resent that , ms . wainwright said , arguing that the criticism sprang from the fact that viewers are more accustomed to cop dramas that revolve around gun brandishing , chokehold happy guys with big personalities . i do n't think the men on our show are weak . i think the point is that we 're not concentrating on the men we 're concentrating on the women . though scott###bailey was the highest###rated new drama on british tv in its first season , in , it is n't widely available in the united###states . it has reached a handful of pbs stations , but the easiest way to watch it is via the web###site of kpbs , the san###diego affiliate , which is streaming episodes after they appear on the air . ms . wainwright hopes that as viewers become more immersed in the series ( it rewards those who start from the beginning , they will forget which sex is in charge and accept it as a great detective drama . i find it surprising when people say , 'oh , 'scott###bailey' is all about women , ' said ms . wainwright . is that supposed to be a new thing in ?
for as long as there has been filmed entertainment there have been producers and directors retelling the dramatic stories from the 66 books of the old and new testaments . but the cable channel history 's coming 10 hour mini###series , the bible , might be the first to include an angel skilled in chinese###martial###arts . that angel , fighting an angry###mob during the destruction of the city of sodom and an effort by the producers to make the program racially inclusive pops up in the first episode of the five week series , a 22 million project to bring the bible to life for a new generation . it begins on sunday and ends on easter . the producers know their angels ( there are five throughout the program , along with a black###hooded satanic specter who often hovers in the background . the mini###series , to be rerun mondays on lifetime , has as executive###producers the husband###and###wife###team of roma###downey , a star of the 1994 2003 cbs series touched by an angel , and mark###burnett , in his first foray outside of the reality genre he helped###popularize with cbs 's survivor . the program came about after mr . burnett 's company was pitched a bible documentary that he found sensationalized and ms . downey countered that they should make what she , in a joint interview in manhattan , called the grand sweeping embrace , the love###story that is the bible . referring to mr . burnett 's expertise at marshaling massive productions in remote lands and her own experience with actors , she said , we could handle the scale and the intimacy . several networks made offers , mr . burnett said . it was clearly a very big###idea , said nancy dubuc , president for entertainment and media at a e networks , parent of history and lifetime . of mr . burnett whose credits include the apprentice and the voice ms . dubuc added we take very seriously when a producer or a storyteller of his magnitude is incredibly passionate about something . they tend to give it their all . what the producers delivered was historical###drama with an emotional focus and digital effects that dramatize stories of moses' parting of the red###sea , daniel in the lion 's den and jesus walking on water . shooting last year over six months in morocco , the producers put a particular emphasis on details , down to the dust . something we knew we did not want to do is make a donkey and sandal movie for your grandmother , ms . downey said . the international cast includes the portuguese actor diogo morgado as jesus , francis###magee ( game###of###thrones ) as saul and ms . downey as mary . the program abounds with bloody swordfights , beheadings and lashings . it is a violent story , ms . dubuc said , referring to the bible . when you have to illustrate it , that 's pretty gnarly stuff . ten ways to open the series were considered before the production team settled on a scene inside noah 's storm tossed ark , as he tells the genesis creation###story to his scared children . the ark scene is not found in the bible , but the writers contend it could have happened , given oral###histories of the time . that dramatic license infuses the 10 hours . the 23rd psalm is worked into the script when david recites it as he and his slingshot take down goliath . ( many historians credit the psalm to him but debate when he wrote it . ) pontius###pilate 's wife appears in several scenes even though the figure has just one sentence in the new testament . more dramatic poetic###license has been a staple of bible movies from the beginning , starting with cecil b . demille 's silent king of kings , which rendered mary###magdalene as a wealthy courtesan , j . stephen###lang , author of the 2007 book the bible on the big###screen , said in a telephone interview . conversely , mr . lang said , important bible figures like paul have been relatively overlooked , because there is no romance there . the producers' initial challenge was finding a narrative and choosing from dozens of bible stories . they settled on fewer stories , mr . burnett said , to go longer and deeper into others joseph and his colorful coat which mr . lang said is the fourth most popular subject of bible movies , behind jesus , david and john the baptist got left on the cutting###room###floor , to their regret . what unites the stories , ms . downey said , is a repetition of human failings and people striving to get back to a connection to god .
certain workout booster and fat burning products , sold in recent###years by retailers like gnc and vitamin shoppe , are illegal and may present serious health###hazards to consumers , federal health regulators have determined . with names like jack3d and oxyelite pro , the popular products contain a stimulant known as dimethylamylamine , or dmaa for short . in a public warning late thursday , the food###and###drug###administration said that the stimulant did not qualify as a legal dietary###supplement ingredient and that it could raise blood###pressure , potentially causing heart attacks and other health problems . since early , the agency has received reports of 86 health problems , including at least five deaths , in consumers who used dmaa products . although such reports do not prove that the stimulant directly caused the health problems , agency###officials warned people not to consume the ingredient . we are very concerned , daniel fabricant , the director of f.d.a . 's division of dietary###supplements programs , said in a phone###interview friday . we think consumers should stay away from products containing dmaa . steve mister , president of the council for responsible nutrition , a trade group , said on friday that the dietary###supplement industry should honor the agency 's warning . the f.d.a . has spoken , mr . mister said . we are urging the industry not to manufacture products with dmaa . retailers should heed the advisory as well . a lawyer for usplabs , the dallas company that markets jack3d and oxyelite pro , said his client disagreed with the f.d.a . 's position . usplabs continues to believe that dmaa is legal , or otherwise they would not be selling it , said the lawyer , peter b . hutt of covington###burling in washington . as of friday###afternoon , gnc was still selling jack3d ( pronounced jacked ) on its web###site as a hot buy . a company spokesman did not return requests for comment . vitamin shoppe appears no longer to be stocking jack3d , and now offers only jack3d micro , a newly formulated product that does not contain dmaa . the f.d.a . warning comes as the agency faces mounting###pressure from medical researchers , sports organizations and investigations in the news###media to take action on the stimulant . in late , the defense###department pulled products containing dmaa from stores on military###bases , pending an investigation into the deaths of two soldiers who died after they used the stimulant . last month , an article in the new york times described the death of one of those soldiers , michael sparling , who collapsed during a training run with his unit in 2011 after taking jack3d and died soon after . the sparling family has filed a lawsuit against gnc , where he bought the product , and usplabs . on friday###night , the nbc###news program rock###center###with###brian###williams was scheduled to broadcast a segment on mr . sparling and dmaa products . mr . hutt , the usplabs lawyer , said the f.d.a . made its announcement to get out in front of the nbc report and shield itself from being criticized for lax enforcement . this is the agency 's customary attempt to protect itself , mr . hutt said . these reports rely on a plaintiff 's unsubstantiated allegations . there is no evidence that the soldier 's death was caused by dmaa . although health regulators in at least seven countries , including canada , have effectively###banned supplements containing dmaa , the products have remained widely available at supplement stores in the united###states . some medical researchers say federal health regulators should have warned american consumers much earlier . we 've had hundreds of millions###of###dollars spent on products that should have never been on the marketplace to begin with , says dr . pieter cohen , an assistant###professor at harvard###medical###school who studies dietary###supplements . there 's no reason the f.d.a . should have waited to warn the public of the dangers of consuming the ingredient . a year ago , the f.d.a . issued letters to 10 companies that marketed dmaa products , saying the stimulant did not fit the legal###definition of a supplement as a vitamin , mineral , herbal or botanical ingredient used to supplement the diet . the stimulant was originally###developed in the 1940s by eli###lilly , the pharmaceutical company , as a nasal decongestant called forthane , but the drug maker officially###withdrew the medicine from the market in the 1980s . among the companies that received the federal warning letters last year , all but usplabs agreed to stop marketing dmaa products , according to the f.d.a . advisory . usplabs submitted published studies on the ingredient in an effort to challenge the f.d.a . 's position , the advisory said , but the agency found the information insufficient to defend the use of dmaa as an ingredient in dietary###supplements . mr . fabricant said the f.d.a . intended to take further steps to remove the stimulant from the market . although he declined to comment specifically on usplabs , the agency 's options in such cases generally include asking a supplement maker for a voluntary###recall of potentially###hazardous products , seizing such products or instituting a mandatory recall . we are going to use all of the tools available to us to get this out of distribution , mr . fabricant said .

denver during their drive to pepsi###center , there was much shimmering ground for two colorado###avalanche fans to cover the poise and production of the team 's 18 year old rookie forward , nathan###mackinnon the inspired play of the defense the mad genius of the first year coach , patrick###roy . and yet , as keith###martin and his son in law drove to the avalanche 's game here saturday###night against the montreal###canadiens , they spoke mostly of the dark###cloud shadowing the team 's resurgence . off to an n.h.l . best start under roy , the mercurial hall of famer who backstopped colorado to two stanley###cups , the avalanche were jolted out of their reverie wednesday by the arrest of their starting###goaltender , semyon###varlamov , on charges of second degree kidnapping and third degree assault in an incident last tuesday involving his girlfriend , evgeniya vavrinyuk . according to the police report , varlamov , 25 , kicked and stamped on vavrinyuk , dragged her around the apartment they shared and threatened her upon returning###home from a drinking###binge . the report described bruises on her body consistent with a physical encounter . varlamov practiced on wednesday , then turned himself in to the police . after spending the night in jail , he posted , 000 bond and was released in time to join his teammates for a flight to dallas , where he made his ninth start , stopping 27 shots as the avalanche beat the dallas###stars in overtime friday . the avalanche are now . the district###attorney has not determined whether to charge varlamov , creating a conflict for fans like martin . my son in law and i had this conversation on the way here , said martin , who was having a pregame beer at tailgate roadhouse next to pepsi###center . everyone has a right to due process . the guy 's not been proven guilty , but do you reward somebody by starting him two days after he has spent the night in jail for accusations that , on the surface , are very disturbing ? although varlamov remained a vital presence in the avalanche lineup , vavrinyuk retreated to the shadows after talking to reporters thursday , fearing for her safety and the well being of her relatives in russia . she said she had terminated a modeling contract at varlamov 's urging and followed him to the united###states . vavrinyuk also described multiple###occasions of physical###abuse by varlamov , who she said turns into an animal when he drinks and thinks he can get away with anything . on friday in dallas , varlamov declined to comment on the case but told###reporters , i 've got such good teammates , so i do n't think about what 's happening . roy had his own domestic###violence episode 13 years###ago , when he was arrested after he pulled two doors off their hinges during an argument with his wife at the time . roy was not charged , but the incident remains in his biography , to be dug up every time his nature turns destructive . in his first n.h.l . regular###season###game behind the bench , roy lost his composure after his team defeated anaheim , 6 1 . he screamed at ducks coach bruce###boudreau and pounded on the glass partition that separated the teams' benches so forcefully , he nearly knocked it off . roy was upset at a ducks defenseman 's late knee to knee hit on mackinnon , the first overall pick in the 2013 draft . the league fined roy , 000 for his outburst , but not before he delivered a loud and clear message to his players if they are wronged , he will defend them without fear of criticism or consequences . so after assurances of innocence from varlamov , roy threw his support behind him . roy 's handling of the situation was informed , he said , by his own experience . varly is like me , roy said , adding , let 's not make a judgment before the process is done . the avalanche players have rallied around varlamov , whose . 875 winning###percentage in october was the highest in franchise###history , bettering the mark of . 800 set by roy in . after practice thursday , center matt###duchene told denver reporters we all love varly in here . i ca n't say enough great###things about him . i think we 're all pretty confident this is going to get resolved pretty quickly . so intense are the shared###experiences of professional###athletes in team sports , the family with whom they share a locker###room can take precedence over the people they actually live with . that the bonds formed as teammates can last a lifetime was evident saturday when defenseman adam###foote 's no . 52 jersey was retired . the hourlong ceremony unfurled like a family###reunion , with his former teammates alexei###gusarov and peter###forsberg traveling from russia and sweden to honor foote , who was an integral part of the avalanche 's last championship team . fans , who stayed away in droves last season as colorado finished last , filled the arena to the rafters , enthusiastically embracing their role in the tribute . the crowd , announced at , 152 , a record for a hockey game at the arena , included cynthia quinlan , who expressed relief that varlamov 's backup , jean sebastien giguere , was starting . i 'm personally very glad that jiggy 's in net tonight so i can root for the avs unreservedly , she said . quinlan said it was hard for her to celebrate the team 's success given the serious allegations facing varlamov . i do n't think anyone wants to judge him too soon , she said , adding , if you 're an avs fan , it can really knock you for a loop . dave krieger takes the pulse of avs fans regularly as a local###radio host . he works for the broncos' flagship station , and even when they were idle last week , krieger said , he fielded calls that were mostly about the n.f.l . those who wanted to talk about the avalanche 's fast###start they tied a franchise###record with a###4 1 victory against the canadiens generally###avoided the topic of varlamov 's arrest . it was as if that conversation was separate from how the team is playing , krieger said . he added there 's a bias on the part of fans to believe in their guys . there 's a kind of a defensive reaction in these cases to blame the woman because you do n't want to lose the player .
nasty weather often plagues the nfl . everyone knows about the lambeau tundra or the whipping winter###winds off lake###erie in cleveland . but for mother###nature to wreak###havoc with games in september ? that does n't bode well for the rest of the season . already , three games , including two in prime time , have been disrupted by weather issues , mostly lightning . kickoff for the ravens broncos opener to the season on sept . 5 in denver was delayed for 33 minutes . on sunday , new orleans' visit to tampa###bay was interrupted for 69 minutes . and the showcase matchup of san###francisco at seattle went through a one hour###delay in the first quarter sunday###night . hardly ideal for the teams , the fans , or the folks watching on tv . but necessary . we knew ahead of time we would have weather sometime during the game , early in the game , said mike kensil , the league 's vice###president of game operations who was in seattle on sunday . we have a security meeting at 100 minutes ( before kickoff , at 90 minutes a meeting with the tv teams , and we go through the scenarios in case there is weather . we go through our meteorological services and the services the stadium uses . safety is paramount . lightning is the biggest worry because it 's so unpredictable and dangerous , kensil said . the nfl and stadium authorities track any storm that includes lightning , and when it gets within 5 miles , meteorologists try to predict its path toward the stadium . last night , it was tracking to come right over the stadium , kensil added . we knew within a mile and a half of the stadium we would have to clear the field . as we were clearing the field , we had a bolt of lightning somewhere ( nearby . scoreboard messages , public###address system announcements and word of mouth all are used to clear a stadium . fans generally are sent into the covered corridors or even into lounges until the storm clears the area . it 's an awkward process for the players . already in the midst of heavy action , they not only have to stop playing for a lengthy break , but then need to fire up their engines again . i 've never had a rain delay , ever , in football , saints safety malcolm###jenkins said . it was kind of one of those things , you do n't want to do too much and wear yourself out . we sat around a little bit and once they gave us that 10 minute###warning ( to return to the field , we started to warm up again and go over some last minute checks and started over . we did the same pregame ritual that we usually do , we just restarted the whole process . seahawks quarterback russell###wilson took a shower during the interruption . he probably had time for a few of them because , according to coach pete###carroll , game officials told the teams several times they would be heading back to the field , only to further delay resuming play . seattle 's coaches reviewed plays from the 11 minutes that were played and discussed adjustments . absolutely we did , carroll said . it was a great###opportunity for us i 'm sure they were doing the same thing . we did all kinds of things in all phases where it was needed . we coached throughout the time , other than when the music was blaring in the locker###room . sean###payton and his new orleans staff kept after the trainers and players to make sure everyone remained hydrated . you deal with it , tackle zach streif said . i think everyone felt fine going back out . again , if that happens in the middle of the third quarter in a big###game , much tougher . they handled it well in here . ah , but remember this when it comes to mother###nature the super###bowl next february is being played in new jersey . outdoors . ap sports writer tim###booth in seattle contributed to this story .
for old timers who still go to record###stores , flip through bins , buy albums and dig into the liner###notes , the experience of streaming###songs on a service like spotify or rhapsody can be dismaying . listen , say , to michael###jackson 's off the wall , and you see only a track###listing and a link to a cursory biography of the king of pop . there is no mention of quincy###jones , who produced the record and has 27 grammys to his credit , nor of the two studios in los###angeles where it was recorded . nothing tells the listener that john###robinson played those incredibly funky drums , with louis johnson on bass ( except on rock with you , when it was bobby###watson . nor does the service mention that one song , girlfriend , was written by the ex beatle paul###mccartney , and that three were written by another british songwriter , rod###temperton . this is the one place on the internet where the consumer is getting less information than in the physical###world , said daryl p . friedman , the chief###lobbyist in washington for the national###academy###of###recording###arts###and###sciences . since last year , the recording###academy , in los###angeles , has been strongly urging the streaming###services to give credit where credit is due . and last week rhapsody became the first of those companies to commit to providing what amounts to liner note style credits for every track in its catalog of 17 million songs producers , engineers , session players , sidemen , backup###singers , songwriters . barbara dehgan , a spokeswoman for the academy , said , we are hoping other streaming###services will catch on . rhapsody 's decision was welcome news to music fans who miss the days when they could pore over cd booklets , or even prehistoric record jackets , for nuggets that might lead them to other recordings . but providing complete credits , known in the industry as metadata , for millions of tracks in the databases of services like spotify , rhapsody , rdio and slacker is no mean feat . some of the data has been collected by web###sites like allmusic , while in many cases the information resides with scores of record###labels . jon maples , rhapsody 's vice###president for products and content###strategy , said he hopes to provide a simple list of credits for each track in the service 's collection within three months , what he called the simplest viable product . but the plan is to go further and make each name on a list every percussionist , horn player or co producer a button that would call up the other tracks that person has worked on . that effort could take a year . i 'm not recreating liner###notes , mr . maples said . we need to re envision what liner###notes can be . he gave an example . you click a button and get 35 tracks delivered to your phone , based on the fact you liked an odd###future production , he said , referring to the los###angeles hip###hop###collective . the recording###academy , the influential nonprofit group made up of producers , engineers , songwriters and musicians that sponsors the grammy###awards , began###lobbying the streaming###services last fall with a campaign called give fans the credit . officials in the academy have had meetings with executives of the services , trying to sell them on the idea that providing metadata could help their customers explore new music . a complete set of data for every track would improve on the past , audiophiles say . even in the heyday of vinyl albums , there was no general rule about what should be included in credits not all labels listed producers , engineers and session players , forcing music###lovers who cared about such details to play detective . most of the services favor the academy 's proposal in principle but have balked at the costs , academy officials say . rhapsody 's decision to invest money and labor in providing credits is seen as an icebreaker that will give the company a competitive###advantage and force others to follow###suit . henrik landgren , the vice###president for analytics for spotify , said his company has been working on a similar project for three years and expects to roll it out eventually , though it has not made the same public commitment as rhapsody . spotify has 20 million tracks in its database , and there are technical hurdles to adding credits to each track . the data must be imported from companies like rovi###corporation , which owns allmusic , or acquired from myriad record###labels . just determining which credits belong with different renditions of the same song creates headaches . then you must weed out duplicates . music aficionados , naturally , support the idea of making credits more available . brian turner , the music director for wfmu , an independent radio###station in jersey###city , and a lifelong record###collector and d.j. , said music fanatics who care about the largely unsung###heroes involved in creating a good record are becoming scarcer in an age in which young people increasingly discover music on youtube or a streaming###service . the information can be dug up , mr . turner pointed out , on wikipedia , allmusic and other web###sites like albumlinernotes , but that does not compare to attaching it to each track , approximating what old fashioned physical###albums provided fans . in his view nothing can replace a vinyl album with complete liner###notes as an artifact documenting an artist 's music . for that reason wfmu still has a large vinyl library , often with d.j . notes scrawled on the covers . even the cover###art is important , mr . turner said . for me , when i look at a record , say an early '70s elektra folk record , i get an idea of the mind set of the artist just by holding it in my hand , he said . credit information is also important to artists , said jim anderson , a producer and sound engineer who has won nine grammys and teaches at new york###university . people worked very hard to create these things , both musically and technically , he said . credits were the only way you got credit , and the way you got work .
houston dwight###howard has a new team and catchy new nickname . he 's not superman anymore . he 's rocket###man now , longtime rockets broadcaster bill worrell said saturday as he introduced the team 's major free###agent acquisition . as howard took the stage and greeted several houston officials including owner leslie alexander and coach kevin###mchale , a couple of his new teammates playfully repeated his new moniker 'rocket###man , rocket###man' and were met with a huge , toothy smile from howard . it means a lot to me just to have a fresh###start and have an opportunity to write my own story , howard said . i do n't think people understood the fact that i got traded to l.a. , and now i had a chance to really choose my own destiny , and this is the place where i chose and i 'm happy about it . the rockets gave him a four year deal###worth about 88 million , a year less and far below the 118 million the lakers could have offered . the center was formally###introduced in houston on saturday after spurning the lakers to sign with the rockets . he was greeted by some of the brightest###stars in team history . hall of fame center hakeem###olajuwon and yao###ming were among those on hand to celebrate howard 's signing . also joining the party were ralph###sampson , clyde###drexler and elvin###hayes . he will be the latest in a storied line of centers to play for the rockets . he has long worked with olajuwon to improve his game , and the###dream was among the contingent that flew###to###los###angeles to woo him into joining the rockets . olajuwon did n't###shy away from raving about his student . he is the missing piece where he can really bring the team to a championship###contender , he said . howard joins a team starring james###harden that reached the playoffs for the first time since 2009 and battled back from a 3 0 deficit before being eliminated by the oklahoma###city###thunder in game . general###manager daryl morey , who led the effort to land howard , is excited about upgrading his team and knows this puts the rockets among the preseason favorites to contend for a championship . i think it absolutely gives us a chance , he said . what you do this job for is to have a chance . the reality is five to seven teams have a chance any given year . the way it is in this league , you 've got to have multiple all stars , you generally have to have dominant top players and we have two guys that we think are in the top 10 in the league in james and dwight . howard was traded from orlando to the lakers in a four team trade that also included philadelphia and denver last year . he recovered from back surgery last season and averaged . 1 points and . 4 reboundshis one season in los###angeles was filled with unrest , including an admission that there were times that he was n't having fun and what many believed to be a less than positive relationship with kobe bryantthe rockets believe that will change in houston . if you can be a great player and ca n't be happy , what difference does it make ? he 'll be very happy here , alexander said . dwight recognizes that his boyhood dreams will come true as a rocket . yao made a call to howard to help recruit the 27 year old player to houston . as the most recent star center to play for the rockets , yao is eager to see howard take the team to the next level . i feel so happy that he chose the rockets and i feel the rockets will be the best fitting team for him because we have such a great , rich###history of big###men , yao said . howard is perfectly###happy dealing with lofty expectations from outsiders because he believes he should control the game every time he sets foot on the court . that 's what i 've always expected out of myself , he said . before i got injured , that 's what i did every night i dominated the game on both ends of the floor . it 's not about putting up big###numbers , none of that the biggest###thing is just going out there and having fun and dominating and that 's what i 'm going to do . of all the people the rockets enlisted to help lure howard to houston , the star admitted that his new teammate chandler###parsons made the biggest###impact . chandler is probably the guy you should really thank , howard said . he 's been blowing my phone up every day . he 's been great . howard could n't pinpoint one thing parsons said that helped sway his decision , but noted that they had numerous conversations about houston 's great team chemistry and the feeling of family . parsons , a second round###pick in 2011 who has developed into a solid starter , said he tried to sell howard on the idea of winning . i just told him 'we 're going to be really good without you , we 're going to win games without you . come make us great , ' he said . the rockets also got a push in a rather random way . howard was in aspen , colo . , while mulling his options and prayed for a sign of what he should do . i believe in signs ... and when i was in aspen it seemed like everybody i met was from houston , he said . i just had a good feeling in my soul about everything , the direction of the team , and just had a great feeling about what they were trying to accomplish . though his nickname got switched on saturday , the rockets unveiled a superman inspired marketing campaign this week that features a man 's torso with hands ripping back a suit to reveal a red###shirt that says 'rockets , ' above their slogan 'a new age . 'that picture along with several other shots flashed on a video###screen above the stage during saturday 's introduction . after he was done speaking with reporters , howard and the other rockets' stars made their way outside where the street in front of the toyota###center was blocked off for a rally to allow fans to welcome him to houston .
as part of a national###research project to develop low cost artificial hands , the pentagon has released a video of a robot that can change a tire almost . in the video , the two armed robot uses a tool to remove a tire from a car . we 're almost at the stage where we can put the the nuts back onto the bolts , said gill pratt , a program manager at the pentagon 's defense###advanced###research###projects###agency , or darpa . the goal of the program , now in its third phase , is to develop robots and prosthetic devices for wide use . until now , high cost as well as limits on dexterity and machine###vision have been major obstacles to advanced robotic###systems . robotic hands that mimic the capabilities of the human hand have cost , 000 or more , and computer vision###systems have worked only in highly###structured environments on a very limited set of objects . but it is becoming feasible to make hands that will cost less than , 000 in quantities of , 000 . two teams from irobot , a robot maker in bedford , mass . , and the government 's sandia###national###laboratories in new mexico are working on the hand project they employ a variety of widely available technologies , like cellphone cameras and sensors , to help lower costs . we 're definitely watching their progress , said rodney###brooks , founder of rethink robotics , a boston based maker of low cost manufacturing robot systems . the darpa research has been vital in keeping the united###states in the forefront of robotic technology , he said . he likened the current work to darpa projects in the 1980s and 1990s that led to the robotic navigation technologies crucial to the development of self driving automobiles . one of the hands under development comes with three fingers and the other comes with four , and they are able to do a variety of delicate operations . in one darpa video , a robot hand picks up a tweezers and uses it to pick up a straw and move it back and forth , dr . pratt said . the various hands are still a work in progress , he noted . the tire changing video was made when we were using the old hands and not the new hands , and they did not quite have the dexterity to thread the nut onto the bolt in a way that it does n't cross the thread . darpa also set out tasks that it hopes to accomplish during the next phase . one example is to design a robot arm and hand that can search for an###improvised###explosive###device , or i.e.d. , by touch . the challenge would be to program a hand that could open the zipper on a gym bag and then go through the bag and recognize objects by touch . the agency is also financing research groups in two other categories . it has selected the national robotics engineering center at carnegie###mellon###university , nasa 's jet###propulsion###laboratory and the university###of###southern###california to continue development of high###level software for the next generation of robot arms . until recently , the agency asked software###developers to develop robotic programs for generic individual motions , like moving###forward or backward now it has set out to simply have the robots perform a specific###task . you could say things like pick up the bottle , unlock the door , tasks like that , dr . pratt said . the agency began with six teams and held a bake off in which it chose three teams to continue in the last phase of the project . in the software project , darpa supplied each team with a standard hand that it then programmed . the grasping tasks were done so well that we believe that for the kinds of objects we had them pick up ranging from a ball to a rock to tools like hammers we do n't need to do further work in grasping , dr . pratt said . manipulating grasped objects was a more challenging task , he said , and one on which the teams would continue to do research . the program is financed for 18 more months . darpa is also continuing to finance the development of low cost arms at barrett technologies , a robotics research firm in cambridge , mass . sandia irobot and sri###international , a research organization in menlo###park , calif . the agency is also planning to create a joint###project to transfer some of the low cost technology advances it has made in the project into a related effort to develop prosthetic limbs for wounded###soldiers . johns###hopkins###university has received funds to develop a neural interface a direct###link from a robot arm to the human###brain and deka research , an independent development laboratory headed by dean###kamen in manchester , n.h. , has developed a separate wearable arm now being considered for approval by the food###and###drug###administration . that robotic###arm is close

beijing a businesswoman in southern china has been sentenced to death on charges of defrauding investors as the government tightens controls on informal financing that is widely used by entrepreneurs . the woman , lin haiyan , was convicted of illegal fundraising for collecting 640 million renminbi , or 100 million , from investors by promising high returns and low###risk , according to a statement by the intermediate people 's court of wenzhou . it said that the plan had collapsed in october 2011 and that 428 million renminbi could not be recovered . the case highlighted potential abuses in the largely###unregulated informal lending that supports entrepreneurs who generate china 's new jobs and wealth but often cannot get loans from the state owned banking industry . the government is tightening controls after a surge of defaults following the global financial###crisis set off protests by lenders . another businesswoman from wenzhou was also sentenced to death last year on charges of illegal fund raising . that penalty was overturned following an outcry on the internet and she was sentenced###to###prison . communist leaders have promised more bank###lending for entrepreneurs and announced a pilot project in 2012 in wenzhou to allow closely###supervised private###sector lending . but business###leaders in wenzhou say it is harder for entrepreneurs to get loans because worsening economic###conditions have made banks and private sources reluctant to lend . the underground credit###market is estimated by china 's central###bank and private###sector analysts at 2 trillion to 4 trillion renminbi , or as much as 7 percent of total lending . in some areas , informal lending exceeds that of official banks . many households provide money for private lending in an effort to get a better return than the low deposit rates paid by chinese banks , which effectively force depositors to subsidize low###interest###loans to state industry . the authorities have sentenced , 449 people to prison terms of at least five years for involvement in underground lending since , a police official , du jinfu , said last month . legal###experts say loans between individuals are legal and that the government has failed to make clear what lenders and borrowers are allowed to do . the distinction between illegal fund raising and private lending still remains###unclear , the dui hua foundation , a group based###in###san###francisco that researches china 's justice system , said in a report in february . ms . lin started raising###money from friends , relatives and co workers in , according to a statement on the court 's web###site . it said ms . lin had told investors the money was going into stock offerings and bank deposits but used it to speculate in stocks . even as losses mounted , ms . lin continued to raise###money until the scheme collapsed , the court said . the statement said the penalty still must be confirmed . all death###sentences in china are automatically appealed to the country 's highest###court for review . the court took the unusual###step of issuing a second statement to support sentencing ms . lin to death after a chinese blogger questioned the penalty in a comment that included the phrase killing the witness . lin haiyan 's actions constituted financial###fraud that caused###huge losses and seriously damaged the people and the state , said the statement , which was several times the length of the original###announcement . it criticized the blogger for challenging the court 's decision . protests erupted in 2011 and early 2012 in cities and towns throughout central china and along the southeast###coast , areas with large###concentrations of small private businesses , after the slowdown in global###trade set off a wave of defaults . schoolteachers , retirees and others who had lent to entrepreneurs demanded the authorities get back their money . regulators also worried that banks and state companies had gotten involved in underground lending , exposing the official financial system to unreported risks . in the earlier case in wenzhou , an entrepreneur , wu ying , was sentenced to death for improperly raising 770 million renminbi from investors in . ms . wu , who started with a hair###salon and built a business empire , had earlier been praised by the state news###media as a role###model for female###entrepreneurs . the chinese supreme###court overturned ms . wu 's death###sentence following an outcry on the internet over the severity of the penalty . she was resentenced to death with a two year reprieve , which usually is commuted to a long prison term . a statement on the web###site of china 's highest###court , dated in , says charges of illegal fundraising can be applied to an individual who receives more than , 000 renminbi of informal loans or causes losses to lenders of , 000 renminbi . enterprises can face###charges if they receive 1 million renminbi or cause losses of . 5 million renminbi .
los###angeles ( ap ) the mars###rover curiosity is humming again after being sidelined by back to back computer problems . the six wheel rover fired###up its onboard laboratories and analyzed a pinch of rock dust over the weekend . it had been unable to perform science experiments since late last month after experiencing a computer memory problem . mission managers say curiosity will work for a week before it takes another break . but this one is planned , because the sun will block###communications between earth and mars . before the computer woes , curiosity drilled into a rock , tested the powder and found it contained some of the chemical###ingredients necessary for microbial###life . there are plans to drill into another rock before setting off for a mountain later this year .
florham###park , n.j . as much as jets coach rex###ryan insists the quarterback competition is not over , the demeanor and words of the incumbent mark###sanchez and the rookie geno###smith on monday appeared to hint at the more likely outcome . sanchez , beginning his fifth season , described the three weeks the team spent in cortland , n.y. , as definitely the best camp i 've had as he spoke excitedly about the prospects for the attack being installed by marty###mornhinweg , the new offensive###coordinator . smith recognizes the urgency he faces to perform well whether or not he opens against the giants in the jets' third preseason###game saturday###night at metlife###stadium . i do n't think one game completely defines who i am , he said . but it is important to go out there and have a good showing . ryan indicated he would not name his starter for the game until later this week . the third preseason contest is typically used to give the projected regular###season starter extensive time with the first unit offense before he plays relatively little , if at all , in the preseason finale . the jets were forced to alter their plans when smith turned his right ankle in the third quarter of the preseason###opener at detroit on aug . 9 . smith completed 6 of 7 passes for 47 yards in that quarter . he directed his team to two first downs , one by penalty . he was ruled out of saturday 's home###game against the jacksonville###jaguars two hours before kickoff . after a four interception practice last wednesday that ryan described as brutal , smith###left much to be desired monday . he threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown , and he fired into double coverage when the safety antonio allen picked him off in the end###zone . on the positive side , smith said the condition of his ankle has improved and he has been eager to return . sitting on the sidelines was one of the hardest things i 've had to endure since i 've been here , he said . i never expected being out for a game , let alone the second game of the preseason , but to be out there this week is going to be big for me . john idzik , the new general###manager , drafted smith in the second round largely because sanchez had shown an inability to protect the ball after helping the franchise reach the conference###championship###game in his first two years . sanchez led the league with 52 turnovers over the last two nonplayoff years , 26 in each season . sanchez continues to be plagued by giveaways . on the fourth offensive play this preseason , a screen###pass that should have been thrown away after his intended###target went down was picked off by the lions' ezekiel ansah , a rookie defensive###end , for a 14 yard return for a touchdown . in saturday###night 's 37 13 rout of the rebuilding jaguars , fans groaned when sanchez was intercepted in the end###zone . while preseason success can be fool 's gold , the jets have to be encouraged by sanchez 's significantly###improved accuracy in hitting 23 of 36 passes , 63 . 9 percent . he completed only . 3 percent last year his single season high was . 7 percent in . i feel good with my footwork . i feel good with my accuracy . i just feel###comfortable in the system , sanchez said . that was a big###step from last year , and i think we are on the right track . now , we just have to finalize some things , clean up some little things , and we 'll be right on track . rex###ryan says still has no timetable for the return of quinton coples , an outside linebacker who sustained a hairline fracture of his right ankle saturday###night . it 's really disappointing because the young###man was playing very well , he said monday . garrett mcintyre , a third year player , replaces coples . ... ryan opened his news conference by using film to highlight the play of darrin walls , a third year cornerback . ryan showed how the blocking of wide###receivers braylon###edwards and stephen###hill helped a running###game that generated 176 yards against the jaguars .
new orleans while sunday 's super###bowl will feature two quarterbacks from colleges with relatively unheralded football programs , it would be incorrect to say that either baltimore 's joe###flacco , who went to delaware , or san###francisco 's colin###kaepernick , who played at nevada###reno , have the most modest college pedigree in the game . that honor belongs instead to 49 ers defensive back tramaine brock , a third year player out of tiny belhaven###university in jackson , miss . he gave a long laugh tuesday when asked if he thought any other player might have a similarly small time background . i do n't know for sure if anyone here went to a smaller school than me , brock finally said . but i doubt it . belhaven , which was known as the belhaven college for young###ladies when it was chartered in , is a liberal###arts school with about , 600 on campus students . it is best known for its christian foundation , its commitment to the performing###arts and , at least to some , its proximity to the international###ballet###competition , which is held in jackson every fourth year . certainly it is not known for its athletes . brock is the first student from belhaven to play in the n.f.l. , an honor which is hardly surprising when one considers that belhaven is not even a member of the n.c.a.a. it competes as part of the national###association###of###intercollegiate###athletics ( n . a.i.a . ) , which mostly comprises smaller colleges with modest sports budgets . it 's small###college football , said joe thrasher , the coach of belhaven 's football###team . you have to love it . you have to have a passion for it . and you have to be able to stretch your dollars . so how small is small ? thrasher said the blazers' football###team shares its stadium , h . t . newell field , with the local public high###schools , as well as with several other belhaven sports teams . that can make practice timing difficult when our time is up , some days we 'll have to make way for the soccer team or one of the high###schools , he said . it also requires the players to make what is known as the blazer walk . we would get dressed for games on campus in our locker###room and then walk a little ways down to the stadium for the game , brock said . it was a little weird but it was cool . of course , if the blazers want to practice on campus they can do so , but they will have to use a field that is roughly 20 to 30 yards shorter than regulation and , in brock 's words , sort of like a big backyard . there was no dedicated film room for players to watch tape of their opponents when brock was there , so thrasher and the other coaches would set up projectors in campus classrooms for football study###sessions . all of it was an adjustment for brock , who went to belhaven in 2009 after a stint at mississippi###gulf###coast###community###college and one season at minnesota , where he finished third on the team in tackles but was suspended for failing to qualify academically and did not return . leaving minnesota was difficult , brock said , because he felt the university did n't support me trying to work my way back . still , he held on to his goal of playing in the n.f.l . and quickly focused on belhaven because a few of his teammates from gulf###coast had ended up there . it was also attractive because he grew up in gulfport , miss . , which is about 150 miles from jackson . i knew it was going to be tougher , but i just wanted to play , he said . i thought if i might still be able to get drafted late , like sixth or seventh round . i just had to show people i could play . he did that , returning two of his six interceptions for touchdowns and recording 51 tackles , including 13 tackles for a loss . asked for his best memory of that season , brock said he recalled returning an interception 55 yards for a score with a scout from the indianapolis###colts in the stands , but admitted that he had no idea which team belhaven was playing . i just sort of played , he said . i did n't know our conference or who we played . i just tried to play . brock did remember well the lengthy and sometimes epic bus trips the blazers took during their travels in the mid###south###conference , to colleges such as cumberland ( tenn . ) , faulkner ( ala . ) and west###virginia###university###institute###of###technology . i remember one that was at least double###digits each way , brock said . at minnesota , we flew everywhere , even to wisconsin , and that was like right down the street . but the bus rides were n't so bad . you just had to have good headphones . standing on the superdome field tuesday , brock said he never doubted he would be able to make the n.f.l . from belhaven . he ultimately was not drafted but signed with the 49 ers before the 2010 season . after bouncing back and forth from on the team to released to the practice###squad to the active squad , brock stuck as a reserve on defense and special###teams###player . he appeared in all 16 games this season . everyone here is buzzing about it , thrasher said . everyone is so proud and it 's a great story . i 've got some recruits coming in , and if you think i 'm not going to tell them about tramaine , you 're crazy .
rochester , new york dustin###johnson has good reason to feel he is owed a huge favour at the pga###championship and he took full advantage of an early tee time on saturday to surge up the third round leaderboard . the long hitting american , who was dealt a cruel blow when he narrowly###missed out on joining a playoff for the 2010 championship , fired a sparkling five under par 65 to post a two under tally of . in dazzling sunshine at oak###hill###country###club where the par 70 east course was beginning to run fast and firm after being rain softened earlier in the week , he piled up six birdies and a lone bogey to finish seven strokes off the overnight lead . i felt like i played a lot better than my score was for the first couple of days , he told###reporters , referring to his opening###rounds of 72 and . today i hit it really well . the only bogey i made was on number five and that was from the fairway . but i had a mud ball . just kind of shot it up to the right and actually hit a good pitch and missed a short putt . i rolled the putter really well and just gave myself a lot of opportunities to make birdie . johnson , who was famously eliminated from the playoff at whistling###straits in 2010 after being handed a two stroke penalty for grounding his club in a bunker , relished playing early on smooth greens in the third round . this morning the greens were perfect , could n't ask for any better , said the 29 year old , who had been a distant 12 strokes off the pace overnight . obviously with no rain they were n't quite as soft , which was nice . yesterday afternoon they got a little bumpy , but with the rain and 160 guys walking on them , they are going to get bumpy . just something you have got to deal with it . this morning we went out and the greens were absolutely###perfect . a seven times winner on the pga###tour , johnson felt that course conditions were likely to become even more difficult for the leaders during the afternoon as the course dried out even more . i thought it was playing pretty###tough out there and i played really well today , he said . i drove it well , drove it in the fairway and made some good putts . if this wind picks up , even par will be a good score , i think . you 've just got to try to hit the fairways and get it on the green and get a look at birdie .
nick###swisher was c . c . sabathia 's teammate for four years with the yankees , observing the big left hander mostly from right field . on wednesday , though , he acted surprised at what he saw while facing sabathia for the first time with the cleveland###indians . you get in the box thinking , 95 , and all of a sudden he 's throwing backdoor breaking balls on the corner , swisher said . swisher 's recollection of sabathia 's velocity might be a stretch . sabathia rarely , if ever , touched 95 last season , and he has hovered in the low 90s early this season . instead , he has come to rely on effectiveness and savvy , as evidenced by a complete###game 6 4 win at yankee###stadium . sabathia was precise , crafty even , rearing back for fastballs that never went above 93 miles###per###hour . the 290 pounds on his frame are no longer unloading fireballs for the radar###gun enthusiasts . he flirts with corners and sprinkles in curveballs . never before has he pitched so artistically . i feel more consistent , being able to throw the ball where i want , sabathia said . hopefully , i can keep building and get better . the yankees needed a strong effort from sabathia to complete a three game sweep of cleveland and to bounce back after a rough stretch last week in which they lost seven of eight , including a sweep by the mets . manager joe###girardi had no qualms about sending out sabathia in the ninth , salvaging a strained bullpen and giving a rest to mariano###rivera , who had pitched the previous two nights . i told him finish it , finish it , girardi said . go do what you 've done so many times here . sabathia did just that , tossing a 1 2 3 ninth###inning on 14 pitches to collect his first complete###game of the season . he allowed seven hits and struck out nine . the strength of our team is our bullpen , sabathia said . to give these guys a rest going into the next series is good . after the game , the clubhouse was swarmed with television lights , and players were confronted with questions about their reactions to the latest disclosure about the now closed anti###aging clinic in south###florida that was suspected of providing performance###enhancing###drugs to various players . among the players linked to the clinic is alex###rodriguez , the yankees' injured third baseman . no facts have come out yet we do n't know what happened , sabathia said . i was pitching today , so i did n't get a chance to really think about it . before the game , girardi was peppered with questions about rodriguez , the unending source of off the field distraction . he said he had not spoken with him , and he declined to comment on how he thought the club would be affected if rodriguez were suspended . we 'll cross that bridge , girardi said . this is in m.l.b . 's hands . for me to speculate would n't make a lot of sense . the yankees hopped ahead , 2 0 , on a two run homer by travis###hafner in the first , and extended the lead to 6 0 with a run###scoring single by chris stewart and a three run blast by brett###gardner in the second , all off starter corey###kluber . but the offense quieted down , and the yankees ended up 3 for 10 with runners in scoring###position , leaving six men on base . cleveland scored twice on three hits in the sixth and yan###gomes hit a two run homer to left in the seventh , cutting the lead to . the yankees loaded the bases in the seventh , but reliever joe###smith induced vernon###wells to pop out . with the game tight again , sabathia retired six of the last seven indians . after a mid may funk in which he went five starts without a win , sabathia has recorded two consecutive encouraging outings , and girardi hopes his ace can get back on one of his summer rolls . stewart pointed to a difference in how sabathia is controlling his pitches . he 's throwing low and hitting the corners , stewart said . his two seamer has got a lot of movement , where it needs to be . the results show obviously a big###difference . chris stewart , who left saturday 's game with what was believed to be dehydration , said he had no issues in the afternoon sun . i felt good yesterday , i felt good the day before , stewart said . the last thing on my mind was a reoccurrence of what happened . stewart had tests at newyork###presbyterian###hospital on sunday , and everything came back clear , and he was behind the plate monday and tuesday###nights .
lake###forest , ill . jim###furyk crouched to study the 3 feet of green between his ball and the cup , a short###distance with such large implications . he thought back to a similar putt slightly downhill , sliding to the right that he made the last time he won a tournament three long years###ago . that one at the tour championship was worth 10 million . friday at the bmw championship , it was for a piece of golf history . furyk capped off a magical day at conway farms with a birdie on his last hole to become the sixth player in pga###tour history to shoot . and with a bogey on his card , no less . i guess the moment kind of struck me the most at no . 9 when i hit the wedge shot in there close , and the crowd erupted and i started looking around and it just hit me how many people had come over to that side to see the finish and how excited the crowd was , furyk said . it was kind of like winning a golf###tournament , to be honest with you . it made it that much more fun . it was a day he wo n't###forget , in the same town the chicago suburbs , anyway where he won his lone major at the u.s . open in . after starting his round on no . 10 , furyk stood in the ninth fairway , 103 yards away and a gap wedge in his hand , and realized what was at stake . i said , 'how many opportunities are you going to have in life to do this again ? ' he said . got to take advantage of it . tried to knock it in there tight and make it as easy on yourself as you can . the gallery lined both sides of the fairway about 150 yards down from the green and gave him a huge ovation when he walked onto the green . one fan screamed out , jimmy , i 'll give it to you ! furyk smiled and waved at him as if he were more than willing to pick it up . he rolled it in and repeatedly pumped his fist , turning for the gallery in the grandstands to see , and then he hugged caddie mike fluff cowan and tapped him on the head . it looked like a sunday###afternoon , and had the occasion of a winning putt . there 's work left for the trophy . furyk was tied for the lead with brandt###snedeker , who was nine shots clear of furyk at the start of the second round and shot . snedeker knew furyk was closing in on the lead he just did n't realize furyk had opened with a 1 over 72 and was on his way to a piece of history . that changed when snedeker saw a video board as he was finishing on no . 18 that furyk needed a birdie on no . 9 for a . i thought , 'what the heck ? are you serious ? there 's no way , snedeker said . on a day like this when the wind is blowing 20 mph out of the north , i do n't think anybody out here saw that score coming . the next best score in the second round was a 65 by jordan###spieth and jimmy###walker . zach###johnson was alone in third after a , three shots behind . no one else was closer than five shots . tiger###woods thought he finished with a 70 to be five back , only to be given a two shot penalty when video showed his ball moved while he was removing twigs around it on the first hole . that gave him a quadruple bogey 8 on the opening hole and a , leaving him seven shots behind and paired with sergio garcia in the third round . it was the first 59 on the pga###tour since stuart###appleby in the final round of the greenbrier###classic in . the others with a 59 were al###geiberger in the 1977 memphis classic chip###beck in the 1991 las###vegas invitational david###duval in the 1999 bob###hope classic and paul###goydos in the 2010 john###deere###classic . there 's not much i could have improved on today , furyk said . for a change , everything went right at the end . furyk has been haunted in the last two years with a bogey on the 16th hole that cost him a shot at the 2012 u.s . open a double###bogey at firestone last year that kept him from winning a world golf championship a bogey bogey finish in the ryder###cup to lose a key match to garcia last year in chicago and a one shot lead he failed to hold just last month at the pga###championship . making it worse , he was left off a u.s . team for the first time in 15 years when presidents###cup captain fred###couples did not make him a wild###card selection . on this day , furyk gave couples 59 reasons to reconsider . furyk described himself as grouchy on thursday after having breakfast with two friends , steve###stricker and johnson , who were talking about the presidents###cup . but i felt like last night i kind of kicked myself in the rear###end and said , 'you know , it 's done with . it 's over with . there 's nothing i can do to change it now . it 's over and let 's just focus on this week . ' furyk was striking the ball so well in the windy conditions he hit every fairway and missed only one green that he made only three putts longer than 12 feet , including a 15 foot par###putt on the 16th hole . he opened with three straight birdies , holed out from the fairway on the 15th for an eagle , finished with two birdies and had a 28 on his card . furyk realized a###4 under on the front nine would give him golf 's magic number . it looked###promising when he rolled in a 25 foot birdie on the third , and his 4 iron on the fourth hole bounced toward the flag and settled 5 feet away . he was 11 under through 13 holes , needing one more birdie . and then he three putted for bogey from 30 feet . the key to his round might have come at no . 7 , when he holed a birdie###putt from just inside 12 feet to get back to 11 under . two holes , one birdie , and a . even in the fedex###cup###playoffs , the math was that simple . and he knew with a par 5 at the eighth and a front pin on the ninth , he would have two good chances . he came up short of the green on no . 8 and made par , and then played the ninth to perfection . brian###davis , who had finished an hour earlier , came back to the ninth green to watch furyk finish . johnson finished when furyk still had two holes to play and was told about his bid for . he 's on no . 8 to go to ? i do n't have anything to say about that . that is ridiculous , johnson said . furyk signed his glove with 59 and put the date beneath his signature for the world###golf###hall###of###fame . he signed leftover golf###balls for the volunteers helping his group . and then , he reached into his pocket and pulled out another golf###ball . that 's the one that went in on , he said with a grin . and it 's staying with me .
new york defeated u.s . open semi###finalist stanislas###wawrinka was moved by the support he received from a packed arthur###ashe###stadium on saturday but simply ran out of steam in a five set loss to top seed novak###djokovic . unfortunately i struggled a little bit physically , wawrinka told###reporters after an enthralling 2 6 7 6 ( 4 ) 3 6 6 3 6 4 battle with djokovic . i think that this was completely different match than the ( fourth###round ) match we played in the australian###open . in the australian###open i had to play my best game to stay with him . wawrinka took a medical break in the fourth set to have his thigh taped and twice in the latter stages the swiss grabbed brief pauses in play , sitting on the advertising boards . today i had the feeling when i was still fit , when i was still healthy i had the match in control , said the ninth###seeded wawrinka . i think i was playing better than him . but he 's not number one for nothing . he was staying with me all the match , and at the end he pushed me , pushed me far , far , far back . i had to find everything i had in my body today to stay with him , and he won the match . wawrinka , playing his first grand###slam semi###final , said he knew that fitness was going to hamper him as early as the third set . at the end of the third set i started to feel my right leg , and at that moment i knew i was going to be out of fuel if i had to play a long match and struggle a little bit against him , especially against him because he 's such a good defender , he said . i had to change a little bit my game because i could n't be that aggressive . wawrinka 's inspiring effort , particularly a remarkable 21 minute third game in the fifth set , drew rich appreciation from the new york crowd who stood in applause for the 28 year old and interrupted his post###match on court interview with cheers . it was a great feeling , that 's for sure . i enjoyed it a lot , said wawrinka . that 's why you play tennis to play in front of people like today in the biggest###stadium in tennis . even if i lost today , i was still happy to hear all the cheering and to hear all the crowd like this . i think it 's something quite amazing for me . while wawrinka inevitably spoke about taking the positives out of the best slam performance of his career , he hinted at some disappointment he did n't make more of the serb 's shaky###start . i think he was much more nervous than normal , said wawrinka , assessing his opponent . usually i play him in the fourth###round , something like that , and today he knew that it was going to be a tough match because i was playing well since the beginning of the tournament . i had the feeling that he was really , really nervous and struggling to find the plan and struggling to find the game how to beat me .
chicago a gunman involved in a shooting that wounded 13 people at a south side park on thursday###night was armed with an assault style rifle equipped with a high###capacity magazine , the police said on friday . a military###grade weapon on the streets of chicago is simply unacceptable , garry mccarthy , the chicago###police superintendent , said at a news conference , where he issued another of his frequent calls for tighter state and federal gun###laws . among the wounded was a 3 year old boy , who was struck in the face but was expected to survive . the boy and two other people , also expected to survive , were hospitalized in critical###condition . mr . mccarthy said it was a miracle that no one was killed . the police said that no arrests had been made and that investigators were uncertain about the intended###target , the motive , or even the number of people who fired weapons . there may have been only one gunman , mr . mccarthy said , or as many as three . the attack , which took place during a pickup basketball game , was the latest flare up of street violence that has confounded city leaders . chicago had more than 500 homicides in 2012 more than any other city in the nation and about 80 more than new york , which has three times as many people . most of the violence has occurred in poorer neighborhoods on chicago 's south and west sides , and thursday 's shooting again vaulted the issue to the center of a continuing conversation here about the causes of gun###violence and potential###solutions . mayor rahm###emanuel on friday canceled his events on the east###coast and planned to fly home because of the shooting , his aides said . among the events called off were a scheduled###appearance at a rally on behalf of mayor cory###booker of newark , the democratic united###states###senate candidate in new jersey , and meetings in washington with the secretaries of energy and labor . the perpetrators of this crime will be brought to justice and prosecuted to the full extent of the law , mr . emanuel said in a statement . i encourage everyone in the community to step forward with any information and everyone in chicago to continue their individual efforts to build stronger communities where violence has no place . the attack in cornell square park occurred amid a rash of other shootings around the city on thursday###evening that left two dead and at least nine other people wounded , the police reported . mr . mccarthy said on friday that while typically few witnesses volunteer information to officers after shootings , the attack in the park had generated fury and help . we 're getting a ton of cooperation , he said . people are rightfully outraged . because some of the wounded had gang affiliations , the police said , investigators suspected that the shooting was linked to the city 's warring street###gangs , which the authorities say have splintered into increasingly###complicated groups in recent###years . in recent###months , the city has sought to combat such violence by deploying hundreds of officers , some on overtime , to 20 zones plagued by shootings . the result , the police said , is a murder rate about 20 percent lower this year than in . but the park , situated in the city 's back of the yards neighborhood , is not within one of those 20 zones . every time something happens , we suffer a setback , mr . mccarthy said friday . the fact is , we 're doing better . the fact is , we have a long way to go .
lockheed###martin said on thursday that it would cut , 000 jobs and close several plants in response to reductions in government spending . the company , the nation 's largest military contractor , said that by mid 2015 it would close plants and offices in akron , ohio goodyear , ariz . horizon city , tex . and newtown , pa . , as well as four buildings on its campus in sunnyvale , calif . it said the closings would eliminate , 000 jobs . lockheed said other efficiency initiatives would result in the loss of , 000 jobs in its information###systems , mission###systems and training , and space businesses by the end of . like most large military###contractors , lockheed , based in bethesda , md . , began downsizing several years###ago in anticipation of cuts in military and space###programs and the winding down of several federal contracts for information###systems . with the latest cuts , the company 's payroll will drop to about , 000 people , or , 000 fewer###employees than it had in . lockheed said other employees would be moved to plants in denver and in valley###forge , pa . , as it streamlines its space and information###systems divisions . the company has already given up . 5 million###square###feet of space since 2008 to reduce overhead###costs , and the additional closings would bring that total to four million###square###feet . peter arment , an analyst at sterne agee , a brokerage###firm , said that in trimming the costs , lockheed remained one step ahead of the government 's spending###cuts . the company has said that its sales will decline slightly in 2014 but that with the cuts it expected to maintain operating margins of more than . 5 percent , mr . arment said . he added that steeper federal spending###cuts in 2015 would mean further reductions in military contracting jobs .
when sanford i . weill bought a 360 acre estate in california wine###country three years###ago , the area had plenty of attractions gourmet cuisine , fine hotels , a beautiful climate everything but a major concert###hall for the culturally inclined mr . weill . fund raising problems and the economic###downturn had stalled the completion of the nearby green music center 's auditorium at sonoma###state###university . so in , mr . weill , the former citigroup chief###executive and longtime chairman of carnegie###hall , and his wife , joan , donated 12 million to finish the hall , and mr . weill became chairman of the center . now he is bringing in his own man to run it , putting up the money to hire zarin mehta , the former president of the new york philharmonic . the university planned to announce on thursday that mr . mehta will take on the title of executive###director , which he will share with larry furukawa schlereth , the university 's chief###financial###officer . mr . mehta can build this place to be something unique and make it well known on a global basis , mr . weill said in an interview . the weills will pay 80 percent of mr . mehta 's , 000 annual###salary to the university , which will cover the rest an unconventional arrangement for an arts organization . what 's also unusual is that mr . mehta does not plan to move to california . these and other factors raise###questions about just how the whole thing is actually going to work . it 's unclear whether mr . mehta can run the center from afar whether the center 's current operating###budget of about 9 million will continue to cover the cost of top tier talent ( the philharmonic 's budget is 72 million by comparison and whether mr . zarin and mr . furukawa schlereth will comfortably share power . the scale of mr . weill 's effort and investment speaks to his ambitions for the hall , in rohnert###park , calif . , and to the level of his influence . in its first year the center which will ultimately###cost a total of 150 million has attracted prominent names in classical###music . ( it also presents opera , world###music and jazz lyle###lovett is performing next month . ) the pianist lang###lang gave the first performance at the hall in september , the soprano ren###e###fleming opened this year 's season , and the cellist yo###yo###ma performed in january . each season will also include regular###performances by the san###francisco###symphony and the santa###rosa symphony . in its first season , the , 400 seat hall was the site of 32 concerts , which sold at about 80 percent capacity . the center 's joan and sanford i . weill hall , as it is now called , was designed by william rawn and was modeled after mr . rawn 's seiji###ozawa hall at tanglewood , with a back wall that can open onto the landscaped weill lawn . mr . mehta says it was the high aspirations for the center and encouragement from mr . lang that prompted him to take the job , although he did n't really need a new full time gig at , he was enjoying being close to his family and being a consultant to music groups in chicago , to which he returned in 2012 after 12 years at the philharmonic . before coming to new york , he was president and chief###executive of the ravinia###festival , in suburban###chicago , where he is a lifetime trustee . it 's the opportunity to create a public , to create culture , mr . mehta said in an interview . i will be there as long as it takes to make this thing a huge###success , because the people merit it . his portfolio at the center will include artistic issues , sales , marketing and development . mr . furukawa schlereth said he felt fortunate to have mr . mehta as a partner . i never thought we 'd able to find someone of his extraordinary###talent and intelligence and experience to come work with us in this brand new venture , he said . mr . weill said he was unconcerned about the potential geographical hurdles facing mr . mehta . the best managers travel , he said . music is a global business with people all over the place . he will be out there as much as he absolutely has to be whether it 's 110 percent of the time or 50 percent of the time . in addition to weill hall , the music center includes the 250 seat schroeder hall , which is expected to open next year . still to be raised is . 5 million for the mastercard performing###arts pavilion , an open###air space scheduled to open in 2015 to which the credit###card company contributed 15 million . the music center supports itself through ticket###sales , board contributions and annual giving , mr . furukawa schlereth said the university pays for utilities and maintenance . mr . weill said he hoped to expand the board to 50 from 27 with people from the north###bay area , san###francisco and silicon###valley . most board members are expected to contribute , 000 a year each . as to whether the green center will compete with carnegie###hall for mr . weill 's attentions and pocketbook mr . weill said we 're , 000 miles apart . i think they can enhance each other . the green center is already collaborating on educational###programs with the weill music institute at carnegie###hall . despite his role as the driving###force behind the center , mr . weill said its success would not depend on him . that would n't be a good business###model , he said . i really believe in leading by example .
washington the obama administration 's potentially pathbreaking proposal for carbon###emission limits on new power###plants will face political and legal###challenges from opponents who argue that the technology needed has not been close to being proven as the law requires . the draft rule was announced on friday at the national###press###club by gina mccarthy , the administrator of the environmental###protection###agency . but to protect industries from pie in the sky requirements , current law limits what rules the agency can make . e.p.a . rules sometimes demand technological###advancements , but the goals that the agency establishes have to be met by techniques that existing###law describes as adequately demonstrated . the proposal would limit new gas fired###power###plants to , 000 pounds of carbon###dioxide###emissions per megawatt###hour and new coal plants to , 100 pounds of carbon###dioxide . industry officials say the average advanced coal plant currently emits about , 800 pounds of carbon###dioxide per megawatt###hour . a megawatt###hour is a little more than a typical###american household uses in a month . once the rule is in place , new plants would be required to capture carbon###dioxide from the smokestacks and sequester it underground . officials said the regulation could be completed by the fall of . but , utilities say , laws governing underground disposal were not written with carbon###dioxide in mind , and sequestration is in a legal quagmire . three systems of carbon###capture are in various stages of development . the most common is to convert coal into a mixture of hydrogen , carbon###monoxide which in this context is a fuel , not a pollutant and carbon###dioxide , and to recover the carbon###dioxide at two different stages . another method , demonstrated by the utility american###electric###power in recent###years at its mountaineer plant in west###virginia , is to burn coal conventionally and use an ammonia process to grab the carbon###dioxide out of the flue###gas . and if coal is burned in nearly pure###oxygen , the flue gases are nearly pure carbon###dioxide . in the last few days , ms . mccarthy has referred to several early###stage carbon###capture projects as a sign that industry can build the needed equipment . in testimony on wednesday before the house energy and power subcommittee , ms . mccarthy cited four such projects . she told###reporters on friday that the draft rule was based on technologies that are already entering the market and being constructed in plants today . but the four she referred to in the committee###hearing ranged from under construction to planned . none of them would sequester the carbon###dioxide , and all would sell it . the closest to opening is the southern###company 's kemper county plant in mississippi , which will convert coal to gases and then filter out some of the carbon###dioxide , reducing###emissions by about 65 percent . but the plant , at 5 billion , is 1 billion over budget . southern###company said in a statement on friday that the plant 's economics were peculiar to its location , and not a national model . its captured carbon will be sold for use in the oil###fields , where it helps force more oil to the surface . but most power###plants are not in areas where they can sell their carbon###dioxide . revis w . james , director of the energy technology###assessment center at the electric###power###research###institute , said that before a technology could be considered commercially demonstrated , you 'd need kemper to be operational and a couple more kempers , and have the kinks worked out . carbon###capture and sequestration , he said , was unlikely to be competitive unless natural###gas prices increased by 100 to 150 percent and the construction of nuclear###plants was ruled out . ms . mccarthy also referred to three projects that would sell carbon###dioxide to the oil industry a coal plant in saskatoon , saskatchewan , the boundary dam project , where the provincial utility plans to rebuild a small 45 year old unit to capture carbon###dioxide the texas clean###energy project , 15 miles west of odessa , where the builders hope to soon break ground and hydrogen energy california , proposed for the oil###fields of kern###county . as the price of oil has risen , so has the value of carbon###dioxide to oil drillers . the value as a carbon###reduction mechanism is unclear , though , because the result is to produce more oil , all of which will be burned , producing more carbon###emissions . e.p.a . officials say that a carbon###emissions rule would push improvements in the technology . two decades###ago when the agency required technology to reduce###emissions of a different pollutant nitrogen###oxides , a smog precursor that , too , was expensive and not thoroughly demonstrated , but today it is routine , they said . the biggest carbon###capture project to date was at the american###electric###power 's mountaineer plant in new haven , w . va . but nicholas k . akins , the company 's chairman and chief###executive , said that technology was definitely not ready for prime time . mountaineer was a pilot project . equipping the whole plant would have cost 1 billion , he said , and driven up costs per###kilowatt###hour by 60 to 80 percent . the company eventually shut down the effort because it could not recover the costs from its customers . and injection of carbon###dioxide into the earth was only possible because it was classified as a research project , he said . mr . akins and other industry executives say that a rule governing new coal plants would have little impact because of the low###price of natural###gas . no one in their right mind is going to start a coal unit at this point , he said . but they fear it will become a precedent for limits on existing###plants . rules on smog , mercury and other pollutants are accelerating the retirement of many old coal plants , and a rule on carbon###dioxide would hit many more , they say . many of the environmental###groups that applauded the e.p.a . 's proposed standard appear to agree . they took pains to note that coal plants also emit a variety of smog forming and toxic###chemicals , and that suppressing new plants because of their carbon###dioxide###emissions would have the effect of reducing the other emissions , too . on the other side , senator mitch###mcconnell , who is from coal dependent kentucky , promised to prevent the measure from being carried out . the president 's decision today is an escalation of the war on coal , he said .
washington pfc . bradley manning will be sentenced wednesday###morning for providing more than , 000 secret government documents to wikileaks , the largest leak of confidential materials in american history , the judge announced tuesday , just hours after beginning deliberations . private manning , 25 , faces up to 90 years in prison , although he will be credited for the more than three years he has already spent in custody . there is no minimum###sentence . the judge , col . denise r . lind , convicted him in july of most of the charges , including six counts of violating the espionage###act of . the sentencing is scheduled for 10 a.m. , and the hearing is expected to be brief . colonel lind will announce private manning 's full sentence , and she is expected to then adjourn the court martial . under the military justice system , she does not have to break down the sentence by charge or explain her reasoning , and private manning is not expected to make a statement . private manning 's sentence will automatically be sent to the army court###of###criminal###appeals , unless he unexpectedly decides to waive that right . on monday , private manning named one of his lawyers , david e . coombs , to work with him on the clemency process , through which he could seek a reduction of his sentence . most likely , he will have to serve a third of his sentence before becoming eligible###for###parole under the military justice system . it took just a little over an hour for both sides to make their closing###arguments on monday . the defense###team asked colonel lind to hand down a lenient sentence that would allow private manning to redeem himself as a productive member of society . prosecutors urged her to sentence him to at least 60 years , arguing that he had endangered lives and harmed diplomatic###relations that are critical to national###security . mr . coombs , speaking to private manning 's supporters on monday , said he was surprised by the severity of the punishment requested by prosecutors . in my mind , i thought the far outskirts of what they could ask for and really maintain credibility would be 40 years , he said . when they said 60 i did n't envision that . private manning avoided a life###sentence when colonel lind acquitted him of the most serious charge , aiding the enemy . the government 's decision to prosecute private manning on that charge in a leak case was unusual , and prosecutors continued to pursue it even after private manning pleaded###guilty to some of the lesser###charges in a bid for leniency . those charges alone could send him to prison for 20 years . prosecutors have made it clear that their intention was not only to punish private manning but also to discourage others from leaking###information . as the manning case moved###forward , edward j . snowden , the former government###contractor , caused a furor by disclosing classified###documents about the national###security###agency 's surveillance efforts . in june , mr . snowden became the seventh person to be charged under the obama administration with leaking classified###information to the news###media .
james###heckman is one of the nation 's top economists studying human###development . thirteen years###ago , he shared the nobel for economics . in february , he stood before the annual meeting of the nebraska chamber of commerce and industry , showed the assembled business###executives a chart , and demolished the united###states' entire approach to education . the chart showed the results of cognitive tests that were first performed in the 1980s on several hundred low birthweight 3 year olds , who were then retested at ages , 8 and . children of mothers who had graduated from college scored much higher at age 3 than those whose mothers had dropped out of high###school , proof of the advantage for young###children of living in rich , stimulating environments . more surprising is that the difference in cognitive performance was just as big at age 18 as it had been at age . the gap is there before kids walk into kindergarten , mr . heckman told me . school neither increases nor reduces it . if education is supposed to help redress inequities at birth and improve the lot of disadvantaged###children as they grow up , it is not doing its job . it is not an isolated finding . another study by mr . heckman and flavio cunha of the university of pennsylvania found that the gap in math abilities between rich and poor###children was not much different at age 12 than it was at age . the gap is enormous , one of the widest among the 65 countries taking part in the program for international###student achievement run by the organization for economic###cooperation and development . american students from prosperous backgrounds scored on average 110 points higher on reading tests than disadvantaged students , about the same disparity that exists between the average scores in the united###states and tunisia . it is perhaps the main###reason income###inequality in the united###states is passed down the generations at a much higher###rate than in most advanced nations . that 's a scandal , considering how much the government spends on education about . 5 percent of the nation 's economic###output in total , from preschool through college . and it suggests that the angry , worried debate over how to improve the nation 's mediocre education pitting the teachers' unions and the advocates of more money for public###schools against the champions of school###vouchers and standardized###tests is missing the most important part infants###and###toddlers . research by mr . heckman and others confirms that investment in the early###education of disadvantaged###children pays extremely###high returns down the road . it improves not only their cognitive abilities but also crucial behavioral###traits like sociability , motivation and self###esteem . studies that have followed children through their adult###lives confirm enormous payoffs for these investments , whether measured in improved success in college , higher###income or even lower incarceration###rates . the costs of not making these investments are also clear . julia isaacs , an expert in child###policy at the urban###institute in washington , finds that more than half of poor 5 year olds do n't have the math , reading or behavioral###skills needed to profitably start kindergarten . if children keep arriving in school with these deficits , no amount of money or teacher evaluations may be enough to improve their lot later in life . much attention has focused lately on access###to###higher###education . a typical worker with a bachelor 's degree earns 80 percent more than a high###school###graduate . that 's a premium of more than 500 a week , a not insubstantial incentive to stay in school . it is bigger than ever before . yet the growth of college graduation###rates has slowed for women and completely stalled for men . the economic report of the president released last month bemoaned how the nation 's college completion###rate had tumbled down the international###rankings , where it now sits in 14th place among o.e.c.d . countries . the report restated the president 's vow to increase the number of college###graduates by 50 percent by , and laid out how the federal###government has spent billions in grants and tax###breaks to help ease the effects of rising tuition and fees . last year the government spent almost 40 billion on pell###grants , more than twice as much as when president###obama came to office . mr . heckman 's chart suggests that by the time most 5 year olds from disadvantaged###backgrounds reach college age , pell###grants are going to do them little good . augmenting family income or reducing college###tuition at the stage of the life###cycle when a child goes to college does not go far in compensating for low###levels of previous investment , mr . heckman and mr . cunha wrote . mr . heckman and mr . cunha estimated that raising high###school graduation###rates of the most disadvantaged###children to 64 percent from 41 percent would cost 35 to 50 percent more if the assistance arrived in their teens rather than before they turned . erick hanushek , an expert on the economics of education at stanford , put it more directly we are subsidizing the wrong people and the wrong way . to its credit , the obama administration understands the importance of early investments in children . the president has glowingly cited mr . heckman 's research . in his state of the union address , the president called for universal preschool###education . study after study###shows that the earlier a child begins learning , the better he or she does down the road , mr . obama said at a speech in decatur , ga . , in february . but the fresh attention has not translated into money or a shift in priorities . public spending on higher###education is more than three times as large as spending on preschool , according to o.e.c.d . data from . a study by ms . isaacs found that in 2008 federal and state governments spent somewhat more than , 000 per child in kindergarten through 12th grade . by contrast , 3 to 5 year olds got less than , 000 for their education and care . children under 3 got . mr . heckman 's proposals are not without critics . they argue that his conclusions about the stupendous returns to early###education are mostly based on a limited number of expensive experiments in the 1960s and 1970s that provided rich early###education and care to limited###numbers of disadvantaged###children . they were much more intensive endeavors than universal preschool . it may be overoptimistic to assume these programs could be ratcheted up effectively to a national###scale at a reasonable cost . yet the critique appears overly###harsh in light of the meager improvements bought by the nation 's investments in education today . a study by mr . hanushek found that scores in math tests improved only marginally from 1970 to , even after spending per pupil doubled . scores in reading and science declined . early###education is an essential piece if we are going to have a better education system , barbara bowman , an expert on early###childhood###education in chicago who has advised the education department . we 're inching in that direction . education is always portrayed in the american narrative as the great leveler . but it ca n't do its job if it leaves so many behind so early .
alton , iowa it has come on like a tidal###wave , washing across the corn###belt from minnesota to the texas###panhandle , a disease that few farmers had seen until five years###ago . known as goss 's wilt , it has cut some farmers' corn yields in half , and it is still spreading . this summer it reached louisiana , farther###south than it had ever been identified . alison robertson , a plant###pathologist at iowa###state###university , estimated that about 10 percent of this year 's corn crop would fall to goss 's . the disease , named for r . w . goss , a longtime nebraska plant###pathologist , is caused by a bacterium with the formidable name clavibacter michiganensis subsp . nebraskensis . when a plant is damaged by hail or other heavy###weather , the microbe enters the wound and infects its vascular system , scarring the leaves with brownish###yellow lesions sprinkled with black freckles . the infection may or may not kill the plant , depending on when it comes , but it almost always curtails yields . and for farmers who have never seen the infection before , it is deeply disconcerting . the farmer who called me had found a circle of corn about 50 feet in diameter or so that had strange symptoms , stalks broken over and twisting , discoloration , the whole nine yards , said clayton hollier , a plant###pathologist at louisiana###state###university . i had n't###heard symptoms like that since i learned about goss 's in college . until , goss 's wilt had been confined to western nebraska and a handful of counties in eastern colorado . but that year it was found in iowa , illinois , indiana and wisconsin . in , a particularly virulent year , farms in much of illinois lost as many as 60 bushels of corn per acre to the disease ( the usual yield is 200 bushels per acre . so did many counties in indiana . while there are no official tallies , the last two years do not appear to have been as bad thanks in part to dry , hot###weather , which tends to keep the disease at bay . but its continuing spread is worrying farmers and plant pathologists throughout the corn###belt . no one is certain why goss 's wilt has become so rampant in recent###years . but many plant pathologists suspect that the biggest###factor is the hybrids chosen for genetic###modification by major seed companies like monsanto , dupont and syngenta . my theory is that there were a couple of hybrids planted that were selected because they had extremely###high yield potentials , said dr . robertson , whose research is financed by monsanto and the agriculture department . they also may have been highly###susceptible to goss 's wilt . about 90 percent of the corn grown in the united###states comes from seeds that have been engineered in a laboratory , their dna modified with genetic###material not naturally found in corn species . almost all american corn , for instance , is now engineered to resist the powerful herbicide glyphosate ( often sold as roundup , so farmers can kill weeds without killing their corn . farmers often refer to such biotech plants , which require agriculture department approval , as traited , to distinguish them from traditional hybrids . while some corn seeds are resistant to goss 's wilt , especially those sold in western nebraska and eastern colorado , most are not . dan anderson , monsanto 's lead project manager for corn , acknowledged that high###yield varieties from his and other companies might be susceptible to the disease , but added that changes in farm management might also be spreading the disease . as farmers grow more corn to satisfy the demand for ethanol , they are rotating it less frequently with other crops . one of the best management techniques for controlling goss 's wilt is crop###rotation corn , then soy or another crop , mr . anderson said . another possible factor is the growth of no###till###farming , which leaves cornstalks , on which the bacteria can linger , to decay in the field after harvesting , rather than being plowed under . no hybrids have been developed that can fully withstand goss 's wilt , but the companies have increased the number of seeds with higher resistance . ryan forth and his father farm about , 500 acres of land north of ames , iowa , about two thirds of it in corn and the rest in soybeans . mr . forth is also a seed dealer for monsanto . some seeds in the company 's dekalb line have been identified as highly###susceptible to goss 's . after a windstorm in , he said , we started seeing these weird little circles on the foliage in the field where the dekalb seeds were planted . at first they thought the marks were because of wind damage or the lack of rain you always suspect the weather , he said but now he 's certain it was the choice of hybrid that caused the problem . the next year , they planted the same hybrids . we were the poster###child for goss 's that year , mr . forth said . we had a complete###disaster , a train###wreck kind of a yield for me . last year , he planted a different monsanto hybrid and has not had a problem with goss 's wilt since . he no longer sells the dekalb hybrids that contract the disease .
gullane , scotland this already is shaping up as a yellow british###open . golf 's oldest championship returns to muirfield after a wet spring that was ideal for growing thick grass , followed by a dry###summer that has yielded three f'' words that are ideal for a links course . the yellow###hue of the fairways and wisps of knee high native grass framing them make that obvious . the trick is to figure out how far the ball is going not in the air , but once it starts bouncing on the ground . angel cabrera set out sunday to learn on the sixth hole , 461 yards and bending to the left with a bunker on the left side . the two time major champion from argentina hit 4 iron with a right to left wind and it stopped a yard short of the bunker . then he hit a bullet of a driver that he thought was ideal until he reached the crest of a slight hill and did n't see a ball in the fairway . the ball was running so fast that it went through the fairway and into the rough . the great###thing about links golf is it gives variety and options how to play , two time open###champion padraig harrington said . you can have three players taking on a shot from the same place , and you might see three very different shots . you see a little bit of everything . he played his first ball just short of a bunker to the right of the green and stared at it for the longest time , taking an unconventional route that makes links golf so different . instead of pitching over the sand , he bumped a 9 iron on the ground , along the edge of the bunker , and watched it roll up the slope and down toward the pin . bien , seve , said his swing coach , charlie epps , as high a compliment as can be paid . seve###ballesteros was a three time open###champion who spent a career inventing shots that took circuitous routes to their destinations . that 's what it can take at an open , especially when the grass is yellow and crusty . it 's something tiger###woods tends to do well . woods was among dozens of players who used a sunny , warm sunday to get their first look at muirfield , which is hosting its 16th open dating to . he played with jason day and dustin###johnson , with girlfriend lindsey###vonn in tow . the left elbow strain that has kept woods out of competition since the u.s . open is not expected to be an issue . woods said he was full go , which is the reason he took three weeks off to let his elbow heal . woods is the betting###favorite to end his five year drought in the majors , and for good reason . he already has won four times this year on the pga###tour . he 's a three time open###champion . he loves to create shots . and the conditions are favorable . as players made their way around muirfield , more than one of them mentioned hoylake . that was considered the last true yellow open , with a dry , hot spell on the northwest###coast of england . that 's the last british###open that woods won with supreme control . that one was famous for woods hitting only one driver in 72 holes on the 16th hole , and the shot wound up in the 17th fairway . did he hit it there on purpose ? said gonzalo fernandez castano . no , that was his normal shot , cabrera replied with a laugh . the 441 yard eighth hole proved to be a great example of playing the ball in the air and on land . cabrera looked at the pot bunkers that dotted the landscape on the right side of the fairway and chose a 6 iron off the tee to keep left of the trouble , and to keep his ball from running through into high grass . his only other option was to hit driver over the trouble . teeing up another ball , he launched his driver high and long far different from the low , penetrating flight on the sixth hole and the ball stopped rolling when it went into a cross bunker about 40 yards short of the green . there 's no way to know how far the ball is going , he said to fernandez castano , who opted for a 5 iron off the tee . the forecast is for dry conditions the entire week , which could make the british###open tougher than usual . then again , players were quick to remember the last time at muirfield in . it was n't nearly this dry that was a green open though the weather was reasonable until a freak storm arrived without warning on saturday . the wind###chill plunged into the low 40s , the wind approach 40 mph and the rain was relentless . woods was just enough off his game that he shot 81 that day , ending his hopes of a calendar grand###slam . it 's amazing golf , harrington said . someone genuinely can hit a drive 400 yards , and then turn around and be able to carry it 240 yards . it suits the guy who can manipulate his golf###ball , which is what links golf is all about .
lake###buena###vista , fla . the whole baseball world seemed to be here for last week 's winter###meetings , the convention hotel lobby packed like a nightclub , and baseball 's youngest proclaimed insider zipping around while he texted with sources . he was the one in creaseless khaki pants , crisp dress###shirt and red sneakers , his head held high . chris cotillo is also only 18 and a high###school senior , but after breaking several national baseball stories from his home in northborough , mass . , in recent weeks , he was clearly a source of intrigue among the people who work in baseball or report on it for a living . everyone wanted to know how the kid did it . who were his sources ? should n't he be doing his english homework ? in an interview last week , cotillo said it all began with an anonymous twitter###account , tradedeadliner , that he started in his sophomore year to gather and distribute baseball news . he gained a following , switched the account over to his name and , a little more than a year ago , started###writing about boston sports for clnsradio . com . after a while , he said , he started gaining sources . he found them online and told them everything how young he was , how he wanted to make sports###journalism his career . and he asked them if they would help him out . reporters who are a lot older than 18 make the same request to people they are trying to cultivate as sources , although maybe that line works a bit better when you 're still living at home with your parents . in any case , by may , cotillo was writing for mlbdailydish . com , an sb###nation blog , and his contact###list was growing . and then , on nov . 27 , the night before thanksgiving , cotillo discovered that ricky###nolasco , a capable free###agent pitcher , would be leaving the los###angeles###dodgers to sign with the minnesota###twins . cotillo emerged from the family den , where he does his reporting , and asked his father , david , if he should run the story . what do i know ? his father said . i 'm just an accountant . cotillo consulted his editor , then broke the story . the next monday , he did it again , breaking the news that doug###fister , a member of the detroit###tigers' starting###rotation , would be traded to the washington###nationals . at the end of the week , the whole cotillo family chris 's younger###sister , kate his father and his mother , jeannie flew to florida so chris could attend the winter###meetings while they took a vacation . chris did go with them to disney 's magic###kingdom park last saturday , but then it was back to business . and anyway , he had been to the magic###kingdom three times before , when he was a child without reporting work . as cotillo was interviewed for this article , he checked his iphone between questions . he said his teachers in high###school were for the most part on board with his reporting endeavors , allowing him to text sources in class . there are times , he said , when he finds himself working 20 hour###days as he chases news and does his schoolwork . the baseball world , he said , is not going to wait for pre calc to be over . he spoke proudly about the thousands of twitter followers he had gained in the past week or two . he said he wanted to beat ken###rosenthal , jon heyman and jeff passan , top baseball reporters on the web , in breaking###news . meanwhile , he is learning his craft on the fly and weighing whether to major in journalism in college . he said heyman , who works for cbssports . com , was writing him a letter of recommendation for northwestern . i 've###talked to him quite a number of times he 's a mature kid , said rosenthal , who writes for foxsports . com and appears on the fox###network 's baseball broadcasts . and the maturity , to me , is big , because you ca n't deal with adults if you 're a senior in high###school unless you carry yourself a certain way . he said he told cotillo that breaking###news lasted only so long in today 's superfast news cycle and that it would beneficial to work on his writing , to become versatile and sophisticated enough to produce feature###stories and perhaps even columns . rosenthal met cotillo 's parents during the winter###meetings , he said , and could tell they were a little dazed by their son 's sudden accomplishments . he said he told them that their son had found his passion and , in all likelihood , could not be deterred . still , cotillo 's parents seem to worry that all this attention is too much , and too soon . they remind him to do his homework and get enough sleep . but he 's , his father said . when you were , you thought you knew everything . cotillo appeared on mlb###network last monday and wore a light blue###shirt , the khaki pants and brown loafers . after the segment , he hid the loafers under his seat in the media room and changed into the red sneakers . high###school garb . the loafers , he said , were giving him blisters . then he zipped around the hotel , networking with writers and sources , tweeting news when he had it . he said he would crash by first period ( an advanced government class ) friday###morning . asked who his sources were , cotillo laughed . agents , executives , players , and not just that , he said . i do n't think i 'll get too specific on this part . but people who are around the game , who you would n't think to know stuff they do .
looking to shake off jet###lag from a 41 hour odyssey that he and his american girlfriend had endured traveling back from his native australia , christopher lane was chugging along country###club road here this summer when a black hatchback pulled up from behind . someone fired a . 22 caliber round into mr . lane 's back , piercing his lungs , esophagus and two arteries . he died about an hour later . by nightfall , the police had arrested three teenagers , one of whom told###investigators that they had shot the runner because they were bored and looking for a thrill . that chilling statement put duncan , best known as the birthplace of the halliburton company , the energy services giant , at the center of an international storm . a former australian deputy###prime###minister warned fellow citizens about visiting the united###states , saying it was awash in guns . commentators called it a hate###crime and asked why the coldblooded killing of a white man had not attracted the same attention as the shooting###of###trayvon###martin . even a white###house spokesman weighed in , saying , there is an extra measure of evil in an act of violence that cuts a young###life short . a closer look at the shooting shows it was not about race . one of the three suspects was white , another had a white mother and a third had many white friends , including a girl he had been dating . it was not a black on white crime , district###attorney jason hicks of stephens county said . it was instead a tale about teenagers from broken families , lives complicated by drugs and poverty , who seemed idle , alienated and drawn to a small###town version of urban gang culture . i see boredom all over town , said jennifer luna , the mother of one of the suspects , chancey luna . he would say to me that there ai n't nothing to do here . nothing . the evening of mr . lane 's death , the police , acting on a tip , apprehended the teenagers in a church parking###lot james###edwards jr . , 15 at the time , mr . luna , 16 , and michael###jones , 17 . mr . edwards and mr . luna have been charged as adults with first degree murder . mr . jones has been charged with use of a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and accessory after the fact to first degree murder . he was charged as a youthful offender . all three could face up to life in prison . halliburton long###ago relocated its headquarters , but the company still has a significant presence here and accounts for some , 800 jobs in and around duncan , according to the town 's chamber of commerce and industry . duncan , located about 80 miles southwest of oklahoma###city , is a quiet town of more than , 000 people that once called itself the buckle of the oil belt . mr . lane , 22 , would stay in duncan with his girlfriend 's parents , who live in town and work for the company . he had come to oklahoma in 2009 as a baseball recruit he was a catcher to redlands community###college in el###reno . his first season was lost to injury but redeemed when he met sarah harper , a member of the golf team . my transition to adulthood was shaped with him , ms . harper said . he made me more open to the world . in , ms . harper left redlands for oklahoma###christian###university in edmond , and a year later , mr . lane transferred to east###central###university in ada . he was a business major . with a long drive between their campuses , the couple would meet at her parents' home in duncan on weekends . their spacious brick house is where mr . lane started his jog on aug . 16 . there have been few homicides in duncan in recent###years . poverty , however , is prevalent . and elm terrace apartments , a privately###run , low###income###housing complex , is on the poor , east side of town . that is where james###edwards 's father is a maintenance###man and where mr . edwards and the other suspects spent much of their idle time . none had regular###jobs and many days were passed watching television , playing###video###games and smoking###marijuana at elm terrace . spending time at the apartments , ms . luna said in describing her son 's summer , and just running around .
kansas###city , mo . the 3 point attempt clanged high off the rim , again , and the standout mississippi shooting###guard marshall henderson ran downcourt shaking his head . great , he thought . i 'm finally playing in the n.c.a.a . tournament , and now i stink . with henderson missing 12 of his first 13 shots , and all 6 from 3 point range , mississippi trailed wisconsin , 36 30 , with less than 12 minutes left in its opening game . one could almost hear the crowing out of gainesville , fla . , from gators fans enjoying the struggles of the mouthy henderson , a florida nemesis . then henderson hit a 3 pointer . then another . soon a rebel run was on , and it carried 12th seeded mississippi past a stunned and unresponsive wisconsin , 57 46 . the fifth seeded badgers held the rebels to their lowest###point###total of the season , but wisconsin 's big scorers wilted while a charged up henderson scored 17 of his 19 points in the final 11 minutes 25 seconds . i was sitting by murphy on the bench , henderson said , referring to forward murphy holloway . i was like 'if i do n't###pick it up , it 's going to be my fault . i do n't want it to be my fault . ' so i had to pick it up a little bit , and i think i did , just a tad . so now i 'm glad i 'm going to have a chance to redeem myself on sunday . mississippi advanced to play no . 13 seed la###salle , a 63 61 winner over fourth###seeded kansas###state in the west region . wisconsin managed 7 points in the final 20 and was outscored by 27 10 after henderson started rolling . henderson also gained at least one prominent fan . lebron###james , referring to his eagerness to shoot , wrote on twitter after the game man that dude henderson from ol miss got the greenest light in basketball history ! ! hahaha . low scoring games usually favor wisconsin , but not this one . the badgers shot . 2 percent from the field , including three air balls , in the second half . ryan evans , jared berggren , ben brust and traevon jackson , four of wisconsin 's top five scorers this season , combined to shoot 8 for 37 from the field . they just outworked us in the last eight or nine minutes , really took it to us , and we did n't know how to handle it , said the reserve forward sam dekker , the only badger in double###figures , with 14 points . henderson 's ability to contain his usual histrionics may have been as big a surprise as the final###score . after scattered boos during introductions , the wisconsin fans left him alone , and henderson kept things low###key . you ca n't go a little crazy when you went 1 for your first , henderson said , exaggerating his cold streak only slightly . henderson gave in once the game had been decided . with . 6 seconds###left , he pumped his right arm toward the ole###miss fan section as he headed to the foul###line . he hopped and waved his arms at those fans after the game , running###past the television sideline###reporter craig###sager to the locker###room . for much of the game , henderson did not feel like celebrating . wisconsin 's defensive prowess is well known , but mississippi matched the badgers with an aggressive 2 3 zone before switching to man to man late . reggie buckner , mississippi 's rugged 6 foot 9 inch forward , outmuscled evans and berggren inside , finishing with 5 blocks and 12 rebounds . he helped keep the game close until henderson started###making shots . listen , we 've seen this show before , mississippi coach andy kennedy said . it does n't matter . a lot of guys , you go 0 for , it 's going to be a long night . you go 5 for , it 's going to be a great night . as long as he 's taking###shots within our offense , our guys understand that . we were getting him looks , and he made some big ones . once he makes one or two , feed henderson . until his shot started falling , henderson said , he thought about tray woodall of pittsburgh , the fifth year senior who shot 1 for 12 on thursday in his final###college###game , a loss to wichita###state . i felt so bad for him after everything that he had done , henderson said . that was going through my head . man , i 'm a fluke . not quite . when henderson hit his first 3 pointer , kennedy called a timeout . kennedy later joked that he did it to allow everyone to celebrate . mississippi likes running henderson through screens for catch and shoot jumpers , and henderson proved especially deft and elusive the rest of the way . his second 3 pointer tied the score , 36 36 . berggren hit a 3 pointer for wisconsin , but holloway converted a tip in and a layup to put mississippi ahead , 40 39 . wisconsin never led again , and henderson helped seal the outcome with another 3 pointer , a layup and two foul###shots in the last 49 . he made 5 of his last 8 shots to finish 6 for . everything he was missing earlier was on point and long , kennedy said . he just had to settle down . i knew once he made one , two , three , then we had something . yes . one more game .

london if charles###darwin were alive###today , he might have a theory about the gift , the instinct , that separates the goal###scorers from other players . atl###tico###madrid qualifies for the next round , diego###costa is there , again , on the scorecard . for chelsea , read samuel###eto'o . for napoli , look no further than gonzalo###higua###n . some men , it would seem , are born with that wonderful ability to strike goals at the highest###level . but how would you explain the run that arsenal 's aaron###ramsey is currently on ? he has always looked like a fine player , an intelligent and energetic contributor to the midfield pattern of passing and possession that defines ars###ne###wenger 's arsenal style . but on wednesday , ramsey popped up to score where no one else could . his score in the 62nd minute was a pure striker 's goal . it was stealth bordering on larceny . ramsey appeared from the shadows and he saw , or sensed , the space and opportunity where perhaps neither should have existed . the ball had been chipped into dortmund 's crowded penalty###box by mesut ozil , and olivier###giroud risked a headache to get a glancing touch . there seemed no scoring###opportunity . the goalie roman###weidenfeller and his defender , neven subotic , were but a yard or two on either side of where the ball could land . suddenly , like a flash of light , ramsey was between the two dortmund players , stooping to get his forehead to the ball and guiding it across the line . roll back the video , and you can see how he got there . ramsey was involved in the movement that built up to the only goal of the night . he played the ball to his left and made a beeline straight through the heart of dortmund 's defense . why , will always remain an unanswered question . because as ramsey ran straight ahead , the ball was played out wide to ozil , then played back in . all the while , ramsey was running as if he knew that the cross and then the miscued header from giroud would land to where he was moving . and did ramsey also know that the goalie and defender would each expect the other to make the clearance ? time to ask the scorer . i 'm enjoying myself at the moment , ramsey said on television immediately after the game ended 1 0 for arsenal in dortmund 's stronghold , wetsfalenstadion . everything seems to be going in . that 's it ? indeed , it seems to be . ramsey spoke like the very model of modern professionals when he described the game . that was a proper away performance , he said , we dug in and got them on the break . some players , like messi and cristiano###ronaldo , have scored throughout their career . ramsey has not . the streak he is on , 11 goals in 17 games for arsenal , doubles the 11 goals in his previous 150 appearances for the club . so we try another source of explanation . ask wenger , the mentor of this arsenal side and very often the man with a reason for everything . confidence , suggested the coach . aaron has a good engine , he 's always been good at getting into scoring situations . now his finishing is decisive . and wenger could barely contain the smile on his face . his team has conjured up great victories in the past on the grounds of real###madrid , a.c . milan and bayern###munich . but those were grand performances , the cavaliers daring to have a go on the stages of huge opponents . wednesday in dortmund was something else . it was mean in defense , and arsenal waited 62 minutes to have its first strike at goal and scored . before and after that , the london team smothered the dortmunders , squeezing out a side that had failed to score only once in 60 home appearances . the gunners very nearly silenced the roar of a stadium that generates one of the most intimidating sounds in sports . it feels unjust , but we have to accept it , said dortmund 's coach , j###rgen###klopp . my players actually managed to do a lot of things right . we just did n't reward ourselves for the work we put in . arsenal had their first chance in the 62nd minute , and scored . arsenal , which has now won 14 of its last 15 games away from home , won because ramsey kept his head in that vital moment . it won because of towering displays of concentration and resistance by per mertesacker and laurent###koscielny in the heart of its defense and because of the tireless determination and control of giroud , who often battled alone in attack . none of those attributes are synonymous with arsenal . wenger , helped by his assistant , the former arsenal defender steve###bould , stepped out of character by organizing a committed 90 minutes of containment of a dortmund team that usually runs rampant . we were under pressure from the first minute to the last , conceded wenger . but we looked solid , mature , with a serene mental###attitude . we were a united solid bloc , not making a mistake , and we knew that our technical###quality could in the end be decisive . one night , one more ramsey goal and a triumph of stealth over the usual arsenal exuberance . but it will send a message across europe . real###madrid , barcelona and even bayern###munich will take heed , and so will manchester united , whose stadium arsenal visits for its next premier###league match on sunday . this is now an arsenal that believes in itself , a gunners team prepared to sacrifice the flowing eagerness of its preferred###style to eke out the points . an arsenal with the unfathomable , a glut of goals from a midfield soldier .
to hasbro , no one is too young or too old to play with a transformers robot , watch a transformers television show or play a transformers video###game . the toy maker started the transformers franchise with a japanese partner in . the concept robots disguised as everyday###objects was originally aimed at 5 year old boys . but as those boys have grown up and had children and even grandchildren , hasbro has expanded the brand into other media and added new toy lines to appeal to everyone from toddlers to adults . take rescue###bots , for example . the main transformers brand contains mature themes , with big robots battling for control of the planet . to engage children ages 3 to , hasbro introduced rescue###bots in , featuring toy robots as first responders . the goal there is to take what you have and bring an age relevant message , which is to get away from the battle and the fighting and focus on the heroic nature of transformers , said jay duke , global vice###president for the transformers brand at hasbro . that was enough to convince ryan yzquierdo , who has been a transformers fan since he was , that rescue###bots were a good way to introduce transformers to his 3 year old daughter . each toy focused on a different motor###skill , which was a big selling###point for me and my wife , said mr . yzquierdo , who started a web###site , seibertron . com , devoted to transformers in . when buying toys and games for their children , parents often look to favorites from their own childhood . their nostalgia for beloved toys from their past helps###create a bonding experience with their little ones . toy makers have long tried to build enduring brands that can be passed down to the next generation . those intellectual###properties are cheaper to develop because the toy companies do not have to pay a licensing###fee to an outside partner . they also bring in added revenue through licensing###fees paid by other companies , like makers of apparel and school accessories . in transformers , hasbro has one of the most valuable brands among toy makers . in , the year the third transformers movie was released , hasbro recorded 960 million in sales from products related to transformers and beyblade , a spinning top game , according to the company 's latest annual###earnings report . when it was developed in , transformers consisted of a toy line and an animated###television###series . but in , hasbro began a new strategy to build the brand into a worldwide franchise that now includes live###action movies , video###games , publishing and even theme###park rides . there are not a lot of brands like that in the world that have that strong###emotional resonance across generations , said john a . frascotti , global chief###marketing###officer at hasbro . for older###boys , hasbro has extended the brand into mobile###apps , video###games and comic###books . for adults , the company has licensed an annual transformers convention called botcon and organizes###events at conventions like comic###con###international in san###diego . but the growth of the transformers franchise has had its pitfalls , too . when there is not a transformers movie rumbling through theaters , the toy line stumbles . hasbro reported net###income of . 3 million for the fourth###quarter of , a.3 percent decline from the previous year . sales in its boys business fell 23 percent in the quarter from the same period in , the year the last transformers movie came out . analysts say it is important for hasbro to keep the transformers brand fresh in non movie years . hasbro focuses on these big , home###run movies . when they do n't have one , they get punished for it , said jaime m . katz , an analyst at morningstar . investors expect sales in the boys category to decline this year as well , but to rebound in 2014 when the next transformers movie is released , said felicia r . hendrix , a barclays analyst . the real problem around this is that their boys' line seems to be very movie driven , ms . hendrix said , adding that hasbro should try to make the brand more evergreen . toward that end , the company showed previews of two new transformers toy lines , beast hunters and construct bots , last month at the annual toy fair in new york . the beast hunters theme , which features robots that morph into predatory animals , will encompass several areas , including television , toys and licensing , while construct bots will allow boys to build their own transformers .
le###bourget , france after several years of intense demand for smaller , single aisle workhorses , the european plane maker airbus on monday secured a customer for its twin deck a380 superjumbo jet , in a deal the company hoped would signal a revival in interest in larger passenger jets . the agreement with a little known german leasing###company , doric asset finance , was for 20 planes , and was valued at . 1 billion at list###prices . doric was airbus 's first new customer in nearly two years for its superjumbo plane , which typically seats around 525 passengers . the order came on the opening day of the paris air show amid a flurry of announcements of orders for wide###body planes made by airbus 's american rival , boeing , including a planned stretch model of its flagship 787 dreamliner and a long range version of its popular 777 jet . airbus has struggled to garner new orders for the a , which entered###commercial###service in , after a series of development snags . airbus , which has sold 282 of the planes , has said it hopes to deliver 750 over the 25 year superjumbo program . currently , nine airlines operate just over 100 of the planes . the a380 has been a particularly tough sell to leasing###companies because airlines have tended to seek extensive and costly customization of its interior to differentiate themselves from competitors . such work can be an onerous proposition for lessors , which often roll a plane over to different airlines during its lifetime . two years###ago , international###lease###finance###corporation , one of the world 's largest###aircraft lessors , dropped plans to buy 10 superjumbos as the global economic###slowdown drove airlines to rein in seat###capacity . but doric , which is based in offenbach , near frankfurt , said on monday that it was talking with several potential customers for the a380 jets . we see how airlines that do not yet have the a380 are interested in it and approach us and ask questions , which shows us that there is pent up demand for this aircraft , said mark lapidus , doric 's chief###executive . he said he expected his company would easily place the planes with two or three airlines . if anything , we are perhaps under ordering the jets , he said . another leasing###company , ge###capital aviation services , planned to order up to 10 models of a stretch version of boeing 's , which the american manufacturer was expected to commit to building this week . the larger 787 is expected to seat 320 passengers , compared with the 210 to 290 seats in the dreamliners currently in production . analysts said they were skeptical about a fundamental change in the market for planes with more than 400 seats , like the a380 and boeing . long###term , the financial###future for the a380 looks pretty weak , said saj ahmad , chief analyst for strategicaero research in london . it 's a very small niche###market . despite the dearth of recent a380 orders , the basics have n't###changed , said christopher emerson , airbus 's senior###vice###president for marketing . he attributed the slower than expected uptake of a380s to bad###timing , noting that the first deliveries came less than a year after the collapse of lehman###brothers , which set off the global financial###crisis and subsequent###recession . now that we are coming out of the downturn , you will start to see traffic growing faster , mr . emerson said . now is the time for the a380 to do what it was designed to do capture growth .

new orleans things traditionally get started a little late down here , an inclination that runs from mealtimes to political races . but with nearly a year to go before the 2014 election , it is already open season on senator mary l . landrieu , democrat of louisiana . why did n't she do her job , protect us from obamacare from the start ? asks a new ad from americans for prosperity , a political nonprofit group founded by the billionaire industrialists charles and david###koch . and a post from a conservative blog that refers to her as mussolandrieu , with a picture of her face superimposed on the body of benito###mussolini , has been making the rounds on twitter . republicans are so giddy about the prospect of winning her seat that their main###problem is too many of them are trying to do so . it 's a different world than louisiana was six years###ago , said bernie pinsonat , a pollster in baton###rouge . we do not have democrats who win anything in this state today . as democrats look across the rest of the south , the outlook does not get much better . ms . landrieu , along with senators mark###pryor of arkansas and kay###hagan of north###carolina , is pretty much all that is left of southern###democrats in the senate . all three are up for re election next year . and the outcome of their races could determine whether the southern democrat , once a formidable species in the senate , is headed for extinction . democrats are fighting against history in most of the south , said thomas f . schaller , a professor of political###science at the university of maryland , baltimore###county , who wrote a book on democrats and the south called whistling past dixie . you can still elect a democrat to a statewide###office in the south , he added , if you have the right candidate , with the right biography , in the right cycle . and then hopefully you get some help from the republicans' nominating a bad candidate . but that 's a lot of ifs . next year , democrats will face not only a general hostility to the national###party among southern white###voters , but also a keen dislike of president###obama 's affordable###care###act . representative bill cassidy , one of the republicans opposing ms . landrieu , has an attack###ad that calls her barack###obama 's rubber###stamp . she and her two southern colleagues in the senate voted for the health plan and have reiterated their support , though they have also rushed to criticize the administration 's handling of the rollout and pushed for modifications . republicans are trying to exploit the opening , insisting that each of the incumbents muttered the decisive aye that allowed the law to pass , which was approved 60 to . pryor is the 60th vote , hagan is the 60th vote , landrieu is the 60th vote , said merle black , a professor of political###science at emory###university in atlanta . everybody is the 60th vote . the democrats' peril is especially striking given the region 's history their party long dominated the old confederacy , a legacy of the civil###war , reconstruction and , later , resistance to civil###rights , and produced powerful senate figures like richard###russell of georgia and james###eastland of mississippi . the region has swung from total democratic to almost total republican control over the last half###century , starting with voter defections from the democrats in the 1960s , emerging republican congressional###delegations in the 1990s and a wave of state legislative takeovers in recent###years . voting has increasingly become racially polarized . john###barrow of georgia is the only white democrat in the house of representatives from one of the deep###south 's five states . if republicans defeat democratic###incumbents in arkansas , louisiana and north###carolina and hold on to the seat of senator saxby###chambliss of georgia , who is retiring , they will control every senate###seat in the old confederacy except in florida and virginia , which have drifted culturally and politically from the rest of the south .
london fifth seed sara###errani was out gunned in the wimbledon first round on monday by a teenager playing her first senior match on grass puerto###rican monica###puig . the hard hitting , miami based puig , ranked 65th in the world , battered the italian to win 6 3 6 2 on court . errani , a finalist at the french###open last year and a semi###finalist there earlier this month , said she had let her fear of grass get to her . though she saved six match###points , she ran out of puff and answers to the relentless attacks of the 19 year old puig , who reached the third round of the junior###event here in 2010 but had never played a senior grand###slam before this year 's french###open . my biggest###problem is moving , in that i 'm afraid of hurting myself so i ca n't move as i would like , errani told a news conference . it is difficult to get rid of the fear you ca n't go to the gym and come out and it 's better . i 'm afraid of falling on the ground and getting an injury , added errani , who did fall###flat on her face to give away a point in the second set , and who had pulled out ahead of last week 's eastbourne grasscourt tournament to rest an injured muscle . puig , who said fans in puerto###rico had woken up early to watch her match live on television , told###reporters she had two sources of inspiration the men 's game and defending wimbledon champion serena###williams . i look to the men 's circuit because there is so much more consistency , puig said . i try to use ( serena ) as an example on the court , the way she conducts herself and just the aura that she brings on to the court , she added . she intimidates the opponents and she is just able to maintain that level through the whole match . puig goes on to play unseeded spaniard silvia soler espinosa while errani lives to fight another day albeit as one half of the top seeded doubles team with compatriot roberta###vinci .
for the past year , pam tanowitz has been haunted by a ballet . her own . when she presented untitled ( blue ballet , at the kitchen in march , the cast included ashley tuttle and brian reeder , both veterans of american###ballet###theater . the flux quartet performed morton###feldman 's first string###quartet live . for ms . tanowitz , a modern choreographer much admired for the way she recharges classical steps , the idea of creating such a ballet had been a long burning obsession . but the problems with the work were overwhelming . instead of ethereal , blue ballet was bone dry and critics agreed that it was airless . most choreographers do n't publicly admit their defeats , but for ms . tanowitz , 43 , doing so was a way to move on . i was really depressed , she said in an interview in midtown . during the show , i could barely take a bow . i knew at the dress###rehearsal when we ran the full thing with costumes and lights that i did n't do it . just how does a choreographer bounce back from a failure ? in the spectators , which opens at new york live arts on wednesday , ms . tanowitz , a seemingly lighthearted woman with a tough , tenacious core , is trying , as she said , to right all the wrongs . in a sense , that can even be found in the title ms . tanowitz is approaching her dance as a spectator would from the outside . and unlike with blue ballet , she did n't start from a concept or work within the same kind of self imposed constraints . there is no rigid 78 minute score there are also no ballet###dancers . the second i got into working on 'the spectators , ' i was like , bare###feet again , she said with a relieved laugh . hooray ! she shook her head and added , even though i did it to myself . ms . tanowitz 's approach is simple on the surface she makes steps to music . yet in her deeply rigorous excavations of ballet and classic modern vocabulary , she gives potentially antiquated steps a fresh feel . for david gordon , the choreographer and director who is ms . tanowitz 's mentor for a joyce###theater residency , one key into her work is the way she perseveres to find the eccentric moment in a series of conventions . she finds the way to undercut and reveal by framing something odd in the convention , mr . gordon said . ms . tanowitz , who was raised in new rochelle , grew up studying modern###dance from age 10 at the steffi nossen school of dance . after graduating from ohio###state###university in , she moved to new york , where her focus was choreography . for a few years she presented her own dances regularly , but ran out of steam . i realized that my work was not going anywhere , she said . i was serious , but i did n't know how to be an artist . in , she began the m.f.a . program at sarah###lawrence###college , where she met her most important mentor , viola farber , who was the director of the dance department and a former cunningham star . while choreographing blue ballet , ms . tanowitz said , she was racked by insecurities . i was not trusting myself in the rehearsal###room , she said . i lost the thread . i got it into my head that i wanted to make a ballet because i love ballet . but i do n't really know what that means . i 'm making a ballet ? i really am a modern choreographer , and i know that more now . ms . tanowitz 's trademark sharp###edges still feature into the spectators , which includes a score by dan siegler , her husband , as well as two pieces by the experimental composer annie gosfield played###live by the flux quartet . but now there is also fluidity . her cast includes two former merce###cunningham dancers , dylan crossman and melissa toogood , as well as four others who danced in cunningham student showings . we do n't assume a certain way of executing something , ms . toogood said of cunningham trained dancers . how we play with a pas de chat a classical , springy catlike jump and manipulate it in a new way is good for her work . similar to cunningham 's movement , ms . tanowitz 's physically demanding choreography calls for difficult balances , quick jumps and turns that incorporate darting changes of direction . in the spectators , ms . tanowitz explores distinct facets of choreography , focusing on building an offbeat lexicon of steps . if i use a pas de chat next to a box step , neither is better than the other , she said . i like having that dialogue in the framework of modern###dance . she has also instilled the piece with what she described as extreme spacing . each dancer moves along a distinct path , whether it 's upstage and downstage ( for ms . toogood ) or from stage left to stage right ( for the dancer maggie cloud . mr . crossman and ms . toogood cross###paths throughout the spectators , but do n't###dance together until the end . their final duet tells a love###story of sorts . the subtext of the spectators has emerged over time . ms . tanowitz said she was driven more by the desire to bring out the soul and spirit of her steps . she started choreographing without worrying about the end result , and that approach freed her mind . i can tell in rehearsal that i have a complete lack of self###consciousness , she said . i care what things look like , but i 'm not filled with anxiety . i 'm much more confident . i feel different . when i started with 'the spectators , ' i made all these sections and then looked at how they would fit together , she said . what skin is it going to live in ? that 's really why i 'm a choreographer it 's how i understand the world . i 'm not going to sit here and tell you that when i was little i dreamed of being a ballerina onstage . that was not me . she is more energized by dance history and especially relishes the presence of mr . gordon , a founding###member of the experimental judson###dance###theater , in her life . he walks into my studio , and i have history sitting right next to me , she said . that 's what was so great about viola . dance is really an oral###history , and it has to get passed down . there 's no product all we have is our progress . look , the world does not need another mediocre modern###dance . if i have a good failure and make something better , i can contribute something . and that 's important to me . it 's progress .
( reuters ) playmaker wesley###sneijder will return to the starting###line up for netherlands in friday 's world###cup group d qualifier against estonia after coach louis###van###gaal brushed aside previous fitness concerns he had about him . the 29 year old former captain was only recalled to the squad as a late injury replacement for the trip to tallinn for a match where the dutch have vowed to run ragged their hosts . sneijder is at the moment the best option in the playmaker position , said the coach who stripped sneijder of the team captaincy in june and then left him out of last month 's friendly in portugal saying he was not fit . fitness is an issue but fitness is no longer an issue if i do n't have any other choice , the coach told a news conference on wednesday as reporters pressed him for an explanation on this sudden about turn regarding the player . sneijder was called up on monday to replace the injured georgino wijnaldum . rafael###van###der###vaart has since also pulled out . i do n't care that people do n't###agree with me because i decide . sneijder has had a year in which he has not played much , van###gaal said . normally i 'd have picked him later when he returned to fitness . but players have pulled out and therefore i naturally pick sneijder because i know what his qualities are . the galatasaray player has 93 caps after a decade in the dutch team . netherlands lead qualifying###group d after six wins out of six and can qualify for the 2014 world###cup if they win in tallinn and andorra four days later . van###gaal said his side would need to thoroughly outplay estonia if they are to win on friday and edge closer to next year 's finals . they are very organised and they keep at it for 90 minutes . therefore if you relax you can easily concede a goal and then it becomes really difficult , he said . we have to run them ragged and that is what we must do on friday .
next time you 're on a plane at takeoff or landing , watch the flight###attendant in the jump seat , seemingly lost in thought . is she idly wondering where she parked her the car at the airport or what 's for dinner ? not likely , said leslie mayo , a flight###attendant for over 26 years . instead , that flight###attendant is probably mentally running through the 30 second review that 's been drilled into our heads , she said . if you see some of us just sitting there looking out into space , we 're probably actually reviewing those safety procedures . you 're assessing the cabin . you 're thinking , if there 's an evacuation , who are my assistants going to be ? who 's going to be the most helpful and calm in a situation where you really need help from passengers ? said ms . mayo , who is also a spokeswoman for the association of professional flight###attendants , which represents more than , 000 american###airlines flight###attendants . as investigators work to determine the cause ( or , more likely , causes ) of the crash of asiana flight 214 that killed two and injured 180 at san###francisco###international###airport on saturday , people with expertise in aviation safety , or with personal###experience in aviation disasters , have been shaking their heads in wonder . how could so many have evacuated that airplane alive ? and what can be learned about aviation safety from this incident ? asiana flight###attendants have won wide###praise for their performance . ms . mayo and others are amazed that it took only about 90 seconds to get everyone off that plane , which was carrying 291 passengers and 16 crew . the evacuation was also aided by some passengers who by and large remained###calm on an airplane that was on fire , filled with smoke , its tail###section broken off , with several of its emergency###evacuation slides malfunctioning . for passengers , some basic lessons were firmly reinforced . these include following crew members' instructions in an emergency and the overall importance of what the safety experts call situational###awareness . routinely , on any flight , we should know exactly where those exit###doors are that the flight###attendants keep trying to point out during the usually ignored safety demonstrations . we should be asking ourselves , if an emergency occurred what would i do ? if i 'm in or near an exit row , can i open that door ? other reinforced lessons were the importance of cabin design safety , an initiative that has helped to sharply reduce accident casualties . it 's a testament to some of the safety features that have been designed into new airplanes that so many people were able to walk away on saturday , said matt ziemkiewicz , president of the national air###disaster alliance foundation . still , as mr . ziemkiewicz and others pointed out , new questions are arising about some design features on the wide###body boeing 777 that crashed on saturday . among the things that the national###transportation###safety###board will be looking closely at is whether some coach cabin seats came off their tracks or sustained unacceptable damage on impact , and why two of the inflatable emergency slides apparently opened inside the cabin , pinning several people before crew members found an ax to deflate the slides . there is something to be learned from every crash , said mr . ziemkiewicz , whose sister jill was a flight###attendant who died in the crash of twa flight 800 in . so how about those images of passengers on the asiana plane who slid to safety toting their carry on bags and other possessions against all standard protocols ? i was surprised , and maybe a bit appalled , by the photos and footage of people leaving the plane with their carry ons , said patrick smith , an airline pilot who flies internationally and blogs at askthepilot . com . this is something we 've seen in several emergency evacuations in recent###years . but lugging a carry on bag down the aisle during an emergency###evacuation , when seconds can mean the difference between life and death , is reckless , endangering not just your own life , but the lives of people behind you . those escape slides are much steeper and higher off the ground than it looks on television . they are designed to get a planeload of people out of , and away from , the aircraft as quickly as possible without their belongings . ms . mayo had the same reaction at seeing so many bags piled up in san###francisco . there were two boxes of duty###free alcohol next to two passengers as they were staring at the wreckage , she said . i was looking at that and going , how in the world did they get that past a flight###attendant ? i 'll tell you , nobody would have got that past me . the main lesson i would take away from the asiana crash is this flight###attendants have a lot of jobs , some of them irksome , but the main job is safety . attention must be paid . consider lee###yoon hye , the lead flight###attendant on asiana flight . ms . lee , who had a broken tailbone , fought flames and helped usher people to the functioning emergency slides . she watched another flight###attendant piggyback a young###child through the smoke . i was only thinking about rescuing the next passenger , she said at a news conference on sunday . she was the last person to leave the wreckage of the plane . and that 's the way it works , ms . mayo said . have you ever heard of an accident where the flight###attendants jumped out first ? she asked .
miami a 13 0 run to start the game , that was too easy for the miami###heat . down by seven with 90 seconds###left###in###regulation , that 's where they looked comfortable . and down by three late in overtime , that 's when the heat finally###decided to put things away . lebron###james scored 38 points , michael###beasley made two free throws with . 2 seconds###left to put miami up for good , and the heat beat the atlanta###hawks 121 119 in overtime on monday###night topping the hawks for the ninth###straight time . obviously , after going through what we experienced last year in the finals , it 's never over , james said . so we just keep fighting until the end , and we were able to force###overtime . it did n't have the down five , 28 . 2 seconds###left feel that game 6 against san###antonio had in last june 's title series . but there was much drama , much to the chagrin of hawks coach mike budenholzer , an assistant on that spurs club . they made a few big###plays down the stretch and you 've got to give them credit , budenholzer said . jeff teague scored 26 points , paul###millsap made seven 3 pointers on the way to a 25 point night , and al###horford finished with 21 points and 11 rebounds for atlanta . kyle###korver scored 15 for the hawks . korver put the hawks up 107 100 with 40 left in regulation by connecting on a deep 3 pointer , a well covered one at that . it came 20 seconds after the heat temporarily lost chris###bosh to a cut upper###lip , courtesy of an elbow by millsap on a drive . from there , the heat ignited . james made a pair of 3 pointers , then a dunk with . 4 seconds###left in the fourth to get the heat within one . and after seeing something in the hawks' defense on the play where he got the slam , he approached heat coach erik###spoelstra with a tweak to a play that started with the heat down three with 14 seconds###left . he adjusted ray###allen 's role on the play , and it worked . allen got fouled by atlanta 's demarre###carroll while trying a 3 pointer with 8 seconds###left###in###regulation , and needed all three free throws to tie the game . i 'm not even going to comment on it , carroll said . to overtime they went , and the hawks were up three with 21 left after a score by horford . miami scored the game 's final five points , with chris###andersen getting three of them , plus snuffing out a lob that atlanta threw to korver at the rim down by one in the final###seconds . we were able to stay the course , keep on grinding , get stops and execute one possession at a time , heat coach erik###spoelstra said . allen finished with 19 points , mario###chalmers and andersen each scored 12 and bosh finished with 11 for the heat , who played without dwyane###wade . one stop was all miami needed from there , and the heat found a way . they 're an awesome offensive team , bosh said . they 've been on a tear lately . we see why . ... it was difficult all night , but eventually we found a way . it was all part of a game that had wild ebbs and flows . the hawks were scoreless for the game 's first 48 , falling behind big as the heat had everything working early even a reverse dunk in transition from the suddenly spry allen , who has been fighting tendinitis in his right knee for a few days . shane###battier dove on the floor for a steal and to knock the ball ahead to james , who got loose for a dunk that put miami up . it all changed in a hurry in the second . atlanta shot 72 percent the heat shot 32 percent . the hawks outscored the heat 31 17 and had a 54 50 lead at the break , fueled largely by korver taking four shots , all from 3 point range , all of them good . millsap went 4 for 4 from beyond the arc in the third , atlanta made six in all and led by as many as 11 before going into the fourth up . there were a lot of good things we did , millsap said . notes korver 's nba record###streak of consecutive###games with a 3 pointer is now at . ... the heat ran a tribute to nelson###mandela on the arena screens at halftime , narrated by alonzo###mourning , who spoke of his time meeting the former south###african president who died earlier this month . ... including playoffs , the heat went 47 7 at americanairlines arena in . ... james has scored###in###double###figures in 522 consecutive###regular###season games , four shy of matching moses###malone for the nba 's fourth longest###such###streak .
the veteran midfielder was not included in paris###saint###germain 's squad to play lorient in sunday 's season ending game , meaning his tearful farewell at the parc###des###princes last saturday was beckham 's final###match before retiring . coach carlo###ancelotti had said last weekend beckham was unlikely to play at lorient , having bid an emotional adieu to fans in his last home###game . beckham received a standing###ovation as he left the field last saturday , having been involved in two of his team 's goals in the 3 1 win against brest . it was his 14th game and fifth start since joining psg in a surprise move on the last day of the transfer###window , and he was appointed###captain for the match . he set up psg 's second goal against brest with a corner###kick from the left that midfielder blaise###matuidi steered in . psg had clinched the league###title the previous weekend after winning 1 0 away to lyon , making beckham the first english player to win the championship in four countries after title success with manchester united , real###madrid and the los###angeles###galaxy . he then announced he 'd retire at the end of the season . psg president nasser al khelaifi remains hopeful beckham will play a part in psg 's future , possibly in an ambassadorial role . beckham leaves psg without scoring a goal , but showed he is still capable of pinpoint passing and crossing and also stood out for his competitive streak . he was booked in the second leg of the champions###league quarterfinal against barcelona , and against evian on april 28 he was red###carded shortly after coming on as he went into a tackle with a dangerously raised foot . there was no contact , but the challenge was reckless . beckham was often praised by coach carlo###ancelotti for the example he set for other players , notably with his attitude in practice .
east###rutherford , n.j . justin pugh , the giants' rookie right tackle , refers to the n.f.l . as the not for long league . after the wrenching changes he has observed in the team 's offensive###line and elsewhere , no one can blame him for developing such cynicism at an early###age . pugh has been one of the few constants for a 6 9 team that is lurching toward sunday 's season###finale against the skidding washington###redskins . he is poised to become the first giants opening round###draft###choice to start every game as a rookie since lawrence###taylor became a fixture in . in college , you are used to having the same guys for four years , pugh said of his syracuse career . here , it changes daily , weekly . pugh and left###tackle will beatty are the only members of a beleaguered line able to make every start . pugh has played beside five right guards chris###snee , james brewer , david###diehl , brandon mosley and dallas reynolds . the team is on its third center after starter david baas and jim cordle , a capable backup , were forced onto the injured###list . snee also landed on the injured###list with a hip###injury . it is an exceptionally###high rate of attrition for an aging unit , and it made a lasting###impression on pugh . it shows you what you have to go through , he said . there are not many years when the entire offensive###line goes through uninjured . pugh ( 6 foot , 301 pounds ) started all 34 college games he played at left###tackle . he was the first offensive###lineman from syracuse to earn all american honors since . he competed with diehl at right tackle during the preseason and took over the job when diehl sustained a thumb###injury that required###surgery . the move to the right side is more significant than it might seem . everything is opposite from what it was before , starting with the need to push off on a different foot . the change only added to the period of adjustment pugh had endured before he began to assert himself and show why the giants thought so highly of him . he was the first offensive###lineman taken by the giants in the opening round since luke petitgout in . kevin###gilbride , the offensive###coordinator , noted that pugh now understood the schemes that defenses had used to baffle and overrun him and the rest of the shuffled line during an 0 6 start . no one is perfect , but he 's seeing it very well , gilbride said . and now , all of a sudden , you 're seeing the ability level because the game is slowed down a little bit for him . you can see the good feet that he has , the temperament that he has , which is outstanding , and the professionalism . he 's shooting his hands out he 's doing a good job with some of those things you did n't see early on because of how fast the game was to him . coach tom###coughlin , in his 10th season , prefers to slowly ease rookies into the system . he had no choice but to rely on pugh , and he praised the young###player for the way he responded . he 's a football guy , coughlin said . he 's in there grinding . the giants are closing their first losing###season since eli###manning 's rookie year , 2004 . the succession of winning###seasons led them to have lower draft###selections and deprived them of highly###regarded prospects who were ready for the pro game from the outset . barry cofield , an underrated defensive###tackle who was chosen in the fourth###round in , was the last rookie to start every game for the franchise . pugh knows the circumstances that accelerated his development will ultimately benefit him and the team . i 've###learned from doing things well and doing things not so well , he said . as a rookie , that 's the way you 've got to grow , from experiences on and off the field . i think it 's made me a better player , a better teammate and a better man . kevin boothe , who opened the season at left guard but shifted to center , sees pugh as someone the giants will build around after they missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons . his work ethic and preparation are most impressive to me , the fact that he 's maintained that through a season that is longer than he 's used to having , boothe said . he 's continuing to improve , which is great . players know change is coming perhaps sweeping change . no unit is likely to be more scrutinized than the offensive###line , which has allowed 39 sacks and has been unable to create running room needed for a balanced attack . the giants rank 31 st in rushing at . 7 yards per game . i have no idea what is going to happen , pugh said , adding that he is prepared to go with the flow , as he has since he signed .
i have not slept in three days , mac###miller said , so i apologize if i 'm a little weird . actually , mr . miller , the pittsburgh born rapper , was less weird than wiped . he 's in one of his busiest periods since his 2011 debut , blue slide park , entered the billboard###charts at no . 1 , the first independent album to do so in 16 years . his follow up , watching###movies with the sound off , is due tuesday from rostrum###records . i 've been filming videos from 10 p.m . to 11 a.m . and then having rehearsals during the day , he said by phone from los###angeles , all part of his plan to continue feeding his fans with youtube###videos and performance . he had another chart###topper this spring , the single the way , with the 19 year old nickelodeon star and singer ariana###grande . and at , he 's already a tv veteran his mtv 2 reality###series , mac###miller and the most dope family , set in his new home in los###angeles , was just renewed for a second season . on a rare break , mr . miller got a haircut a buzzer was audible in the background and spoke with melena ryzik about forging a rap career . i started because i loved to make music , he said . to create for the sake of creating and nothing else . these are excerpts from the conversation . q . how do you like living###in###los###angeles ? a . greatest decision of my life . pittsburgh forever , that 's my heart . but l.a . is definitely where i needed to go . it 's the place for me to kind of grow into myself , and the only way to do that is to do everything . i built my own studio , which has changed my life . i really love the idea of just making super weird songs that do n't really have a form , and they do n't have a purpose . the music###industry is so serious what single are you gonna do ? what 's for the radio ? what 's for the girls ? it 's really stressful for a young###artist , because you do n't know what 's going to tell your story , so doing this is just liberating . you have a lot of guests on your album tyler , the creator , action###bronson and flying###lotus as a producer . how did you get them involved ? i paid each of them , 000 to make me look cool give me a verse , because you all are cool and i 'm an mtv reality star . no , to be real , i came out to l.a . and i have this studio and the door 's always open . so i found a group of people that i consider really good friends , and they 're my peers and my homies . i did n't hit up my manager , like , hey , man , i 've always really wanted to do a song with whoever rivers###cuomo from weezer can you make this happen ? i dropped the cover , and everyone is like , mac###miller naked , he 's crazy ! half the people are saying , oh man , i 'm not going to buy that , what am i gonna look like buying a naked dude album ? people thought i was doing it for attention , as a marketing tactic , which really made me laugh , because i 'm so over doing things as a marketing tactic . that ruins everything . as days went , people started###coming up with their own little concept , which i love . i want it to start discussions . do you watch your show ? it 's weird to see that stuff , being super obnoxious on television . but other people consider it funny . now that we got the good ratings and we 're coming back for the second season , i 'm making all sorts of demands . i 'm trying to make it really weird . if you really watch the show and think about it , we do n't do anything . but season 2 is going to be more emotional and intimate . we 're going to get into everyone 's relationships , with their struggles and with their girlfriends . that 'll be tight mac###miller and the most mope family .
detroit despite steady profits , last year was a rocky one for general###motors , raising###questions about the strength of the company 's comeback from its bankruptcy and government bailout . g.m. , the nation 's biggest automaker , posted its lowest united###states market###share in decades , searched for answers to its longstanding troubles in europe and struggled to overcome the lingering , politically###charged stigma of being government motors . on wednesday , g.m . 's chief###executive , daniel akerson , acknowledged that the company still had a long way to go before it completed its turnaround . but he said that a host of promising new products should help it gain###traction this year . this is going to be a strong year for product introductions , not only in north###america , but around the globe , mr . akerson said in a briefing with reporters at g.m . 's headquarters . in 2013 and ' , the sun will be at our backs . in , the company 's share of the united###states market sank to . 9 percent , down from . 6 percent the year before . it was the company 's lowest market###share in more than 50 years . and while the overall american market grew . 4 percent last year , g.m . 's sales increased just . 7 percent . by contrast , toyota and honda rebounded sharply from supply disruptions caused by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan , and rivals like chrysler and volkswagen made big sales gains . it was a very mediocre year for g.m. , said rebecca lindland , an analyst at the research firm ihs automotive . they are still kind of finding their way postbankruptcy . mr . akerson , 64 , said he expected g.m . to make modest market###share improvements this year , as it refreshes its showrooms with 13 new products , including redesigned versions of its chevrolet and gmc pickup###trucks . what you 'll see is a g.m . that is projecting some confidence and some vigor , he said . that description has hardly applied to g.m . since it was forced into bankruptcy in 2009 by the obama administration as a condition for the final portions of its . 5 billion government bailout . the company emerged as a smaller , leaner competitor with fewer brands , employees and factories , and a revamped management team led by mr . akerson , a government appointed board###member who took over as chief###executive in the fall of . since its bankruptcy , g.m . has had some success introducing new cars in the united###states , like the chevrolet###cruze and the cadillac###ats . it has also continued to grow in china . in addition , the company has reduced its pension overhang by buying out some salaried###workers and transferring its long###term obligations to the rest of the white###collar work force to an outside insurance firm . g.m . also received good news last month when the treasury###department agreed to sell 200 million of the g.m . shares owned by taxpayers back to the company and pledged to sell its remaining 300 million###shares by early . i think it 's important for that chapter to close on that part of our history , mr . akerson said . g.m . is expected to report healthy earnings this month for the fourth###quarter of , which would be its 12th straight profitable quarter . but it is still losing considerable###money in europe , where the economic###downturn has depressed vehicle###sales for several automakers . the company has forecast that its 2012 losses in europe will be at least . 5 billion . mr . akerson said he hoped the losses could be trimmed by one third this year , but reiterated that g.m . 's european operations would not break even until mid###decade . he said there were no new plans for job###cuts or factory closings on the continent although the company planned to continue whittling down costs there . we are taking out cost###structure intelligently , more with a scalpel than a knife , he said . mr . akerson said that the company 's finances had improved and that he hoped it would be able to shed its junk credit###rating this year and return to an investment grade rating , which would allow it to reduce its borrowing costs . but he was circumspect when discussing his own future . a former executive with the carlyle group , a private###equity###firm , he declined to put a timetable on his tenure as g.m . 's chief . i think i will be here next year at this time , he said . but i do n't know how long that will run . in the short###term , mr . akerson said he hoped g.m . could generate excitement for its new products next week at the industry 's big annual trade show in detroit . the company is set to unveil a coming redesign of its corvette sports###car , as well as a cadillac version of its volt plug###in###hybrid . consumers will also get their first look at the new pickups , which are scheduled to have their debut later this year . the auto show spotlight could become a turning###point in the public 's perception of g.m. , said ms . lindland of ihs . the reality is that this company still has many challenges ahead , she said . it 's not the behemoth it once was , but they 're still not quite nimble yet .

washington with 2013 bringing tax increases on the incomes of a small sliver of the richest americans , the country 's top earners now face a heavier tax###burden than at any time since jimmy###carter was president . the last minute deal struck by the departing 112th congress raised###taxes on a handful of the highest###earning americans , with about . 3 percent of households experiencing no change in their income###taxes . but the tax###policy###center estimates that the average family in the top 1 percent will pay a federal tax###rate of more than 36 percent this year , up from 28 percent in . that is the highest###rate since , at least . by some measures , the tax###code might now be the most progressive in a generation , tax economists said , while noting that every american is paying a lower burden currently than they did then . in fact , the total federal tax###rate is still vastly lower for the very rich than it was at any point in the 1940s through 1970s . it has risen from historical lows , but is still closer to those lows than where it was in the postwar decades . we made the system more progressive by raising rates at the top and leaving them for everyone else , said roberton williams of the tax###policy###center , a research group based in washington . the offsetting issue is that the rich have gotten a lot richer . indeed , over the last three decades the bulk of pretax income gains have gone to the wealthy and the higher up on the income scale , the bigger the gains , with billionaires outpacing millionaires who outpaced the merely rich . economists doubted that the tax increases would do much to reverse that trend . with the recovery failing to improve incomes for millions of average americans and the country running trillion###dollar deficits , president###obama made tax fairness a centerpiece of his re election campaign . in the heated negotiations with house speaker john a . boehner , that translated into the white###house 's insistence on tax increases for the top 2 percent of households and a continuation of tax###breaks and cuts for a vast number of taxpayers . republicans resisted increasing tax###rates and aimed for lower revenue targets , arguing that spending was the budget 's primary problem and that no american should see his or her taxes go up too much in such a sluggish economy . but ultimately they relented , and congress cut a last minute deal . a central promise of my campaign for president was to change the tax###code that was too skewed towards the wealthy at the expense of working middle###class americans , mr . obama said after congress reached an agreement . that deal includes a host of tax increases on the rich . it raises the tax rate to . 6 percent from 35 percent on income above , 000 for individuals , and , 000 for couples . the rate on dividends and capital###gains for those same taxpayers was bumped up 5 percentage###points , to 20 percent . congress also reinstated limits on the amount households with more than , 000 in income can deduct . on top of that , two new surcharges a.8 percent tax on investment income and a.9 percent tax on regular###income hit those same wealthy households . as a result of the taxes added in both the deal and the 2010 health###care law , which came into effect this year , taxpayers with 1 million in income and up will pay on average , 000 more in taxes . millionaires' share of the overall federal tax###burden will climb to 23 percent from 20 percent . the result is a tax###code that squeezes hundreds of billions###of###dollars more from the very well off about 600 billion more over 10 years while leaving the tax###burden on everyone else mostly as it was . and the changes come after 30 years of both republican and democratic administrations doing the converse zeroing out federal###income###taxes for many poor working###families while also reducing the tax###burden for households on the higher###end of the income scale . back at the end of the carter and beginning of the reagan administrations , we had a pretty severe income###tax burden for people at a low###level of income . it was actually kind of appalling , said alan d . viard , a tax expert at the american###enterprise###institute , a right of center research group in washington . policy###makers in both parties realized that was bad policy and started whittling away at it by expanding credits and tinkering with tax###rates . after those changes and the new law , comparing average tax###rates for poor###households and wealthy households , 2013 might be the most progressive###tax code since . but economists cautioned that measuring progressivity is tricky . it 's not like there is some scientific measure of progressivity all economists agreed upon , said leonard e . burman , a professor of public###affairs at syracuse###university . people look at different numerical measures and they 've###changed in different ways at different income###levels . mr . viard said that over time the code had become markedly more progressive for the poor compared with the middle###class . but it arguably did not become much more progressive for the rich compared with the middle###class , or the very rich compared with the rich , in part because of the george w . bush era tax###cuts on investment income . an anesthesiologist who earns a , 000 salary subject to payroll and income###taxes might pay a higher###tax rate than a hedge###fund manager making 1 billion subject mostly to capital###gains###taxes , for instance . economists are also divided on the ultimate effect of those tax increases on the wealthy to income###growth and income###inequality in the united###states . the recession hit the incomes of the rich hard , but they have snapped back much more strongly than those for middle or low income workers . i 'd still rather be really rich , even if i 'm getting taxed much more than a low income person would be , mr . williams of the tax###policy###center added .
the rookie coach mike###petke has been with the red###bulls metrostars through bad###times , worse times and sheer debacles . that is why he is guardedly sanguine about his team 's current state . if anyone 's wondering why i do n't###talk supporters###shield and playoffs it 's because i 've been around this organization for a long time and for every two or three good things that happen it seems they come crashing down in the end , petke said tuesday during his weekly conference call . i 'm just not going to set ourselves up for that , and it 's why i do n't want to think past the next game . we do what we can do to be set up for some good things . but we 've all lived this scenario for 16 years . no one who has followed the club , then called the new york new jersey metrostars , since the inception of major###league###soccer in 1996 is likely to dispute petke 's measured reasoning . petke is a new york native ( long###island ) who played for the club from 1998 to , with little collective success to show . the club has been in the title game once ( losing to columbus in . now in his first season as the team 's coach after a few years as an assistant to hans###backe ( remember him ? ) , petke has the red###bulls , 52 points ) on a five game###unbeaten###streak . if the red###bulls can get through the last three regular###season###games without a loss , the team would eclipse this season 's longest###streak without a loss , which is seven games from april 20 to may . sunday 's 1 1 tie in the rain at seattle put the red###bulls into the top spot over all in m.l.s . with a shot at winning the supporters###shield that goes to the no . 1 team over all during the regular###season ( and includes an automatic###berth in next season 's concacaf###champions###league . to look in the players' eyes before the game in seattle and see they were ready was a great feeling , petke said . there 's a belief that we can accomplish things . there 's no question we have the backbone to go in to a hostile###environment against a good team and get a result . a point there was phenomenal , it gives us confidence . while the red###bulls have a lackluster 5 7 4 record on the road , that includes wins at real###salt###lake and sporting###kansas###city , plus sunday 's draw at seattle . i 'm going to tell you something i told the players before our first game of the season , something i truly believe it and truly live , he said . any shortcomings we have this year , the failures are on my shoulders . any success lies on players' shoulders . when we lose or do n't###perform right it comes down to my preparation . when we win games , i 'm not on the field . it 's the players who have to win the games . i 'm very happy about the wins , but credit goes to the players . they 're the ones who are living it , and i 'm the one on the sideline freaking out . there have been some good moments , but i believe the finest are ones ahead and those can be erased if in the next three games we do n't have the right mentality . the red###bulls close out the regular###season with games against new england ( saturday , at houston ( oct . 20 ) and against chicago ( oct . 27 ) . asked about a comment by steve###nicol , the former new england coach , in the daily news that thierry###henry 's absence from sunday 's game was a disgrace , petke stood by the decision to give the team 's captain the week off so he would not aggravate a tender achilles' tendon . i have not heard it , petke said . and it bothers me not one ounce that anyone outside has something negative to say . that said , i disagree wholeheartedly . it 's a medical situation . we have known about it and it 's not about just getting through a game uninjured . with thierry there was the possibility that with the achilles it takes him two to three weeks to get back . it was n't###worth it , to be honest . this comes from the medical###staff advising and making###decisions . whoever said it , it does n't###bother me and does n't effect the team whatsoever .
phoenix as intensely close twins , the basketball players markieff and marcus morris have identical cars , beards and tattoos . one inking on their left biceps proclaims foe , shorthand for family over everything . it would not be accurate to say that motto also represents a grand###strategy for their struggling and rebuilding team , the phoenix###suns . still , the team has served as a kind of sneakered laboratory over the years for the study of brotherly dynamics . last month , phoenix traded with houston to acquire marcus morris , a 6 foot 9 small###forward . the deal was made , in part , to ease the anxiety the brothers felt last season when they were rookies and were separated for the first time in their lives . it 's not an accident that these two guys are here , said lon babby , the suns' president for basketball operations . we believe their bond is special and is going to make each of them better and therefore make our team better . the morrises are only the second set of twins to play for the same n.b.a . team . the first set dick and tom###van###arsdale also played for the suns , during the 1976 77 season . the date of marcus morris 's debut with his brother in phoenix , feb . 22 , coincided with the van arsdales' 70th birthday . you 've always got somebody with you to work on your game with , to watch film with , basically like another coach , markieff morris , a 6 10 power###forward , said of the advantages of playing with his brother . the pairing of the 23 year old twins remains a work in progress on an erratic team with a 23 48 record . but team officials are encouraged to have two teammates who trust each other inviolably and need no more than eye###contact and sometimes not even that to know what the other is planning . nobody in the league has played longer together than we have , marcus morris said . since the 2008 9 season , the suns' bench has included an unusual number of players with brothers in the n.b.a. , including robin###lopez , a twin of the nets' all star brook###lopez jarron###collins , a twin of jason###collins of the washington###wizards taylor griffin , the older###brother of the all star forward blake###griffin of the los###angeles###clippers and luke zeller , the eldest of three basketball playing brothers who include tyler ( cleveland###cavaliers ) and cody ( indiana###university . unfortunately for the suns , recent phoenix teams have mostly fielded the lesser known and lesser accomplished brother . not every sports franchise and family can emulate the football playing mannings , with two sons quarterbacks eli and peyton who have taken confetti showers while celebrating victories in the super###bowl . if there was a strategy , we should have gone with the better brother each time instead of the worse brother , steve###kerr , a former suns general###manager , said with a laugh . it 's just total coincidence . more than anything , it 's a sign of how good the suns have been over the years . they were never in position to draft the more accomplished brother . in the case of taylor griffin and the undrafted luke zeller , neither of whom are currently in the n.b.a. , their lack of success may have had as much to do with birth###order as draft order . a 2012 canadian and australian study indicated that elite###athletes tended not to be firstborn children . the reasons are not clearly understood by researchers , but they theorize that older###siblings often introduce younger###siblings to a sport and serve as a role###model . meanwhile , younger###brothers and sisters must quickly###develop motor###skills and creativity , and may be willing to take more risks , to compete against older , bigger family members . i always told tyler and cody , 'you better learn from my mistakes and learn quicker than i did , ' luke zeller said . growing up in basketball mad indiana , he said he did not coddle his younger###brothers . once , in elementary###school , the three boys and their father were playing a two on two game in a bedroom when luke said he bumped tyler into a wall to prevent the winning###basket . the collision left a dent , which was covered by a poster so their mother would not find out . it was game point , luke zeller said . you 're not going to give it to him easy , even if it 's a nerf ball and hoop .
on the stars ( are out tonight , the new single from david###bowie 's comeback###album , the next day , one line jumps out we will never be rid of these stars . in the video mr . bowie and the actress tilda###swinton play an elderly###couple persecuted by a pair of vampiric stars , who stalk them , invade their house and manipulate them like marionettes . but the song itself is less literal . it portrays celebrities as members of an overlord class who burn you with their radiant smiles but also as faintly pitiable creatures , jealous of the quiet , grounded lives of ordinary folk . but i hope they live###forever , mr . bowie sings , a nod to the notion of fame as immortality , a compensation for all the damage and delusion that comes with the territory . fame and death are closely braided themes shadowing the next day , which is receiving acclaim as mr . bowie 's strongest album in decades . imagery of decay , debility and dejection pervade the record here am i not quite dead my body left to rot in a hollow tree , mr . bowie sings on the title###track . for most of the 21 st century mr . bowie had disappeared from view , even as the glam theatricality and gender bending he pioneered was dominating pop through figures like lady###gaga . most assumed that he 'd effectively retired , physically exhausted after a major heart###attack and surgery in , creatively spent after four decades of self reinvention . but in a brilliantly organized stealth attack he returned without warning in january with the wistful single where are we now ? , the herald for the next day , which is out on columbia on tuesday . the album , his first in a decade , asserts mr . bowie 's continued###relevance as a musician and songwriter . dark in theme and surprisingly harsh sounding , the next day nods to high points in his past , notably lodger , from , but the lyrics are unusually direct and unflinching for an artist who has often hidden behind masks or wrapped bleakness in obliqueness . meanwhile mr . bowie 's stature in pop history as the performer who most convincingly bridged the gap between art and rock is being shored up by david###bowie is , a retrospective opening march 23 at the victoria###and###albert###museum in london , a celebration of his mastery of all the nonaudio aspects of pop , including clothes , stage###sets , record artwork and video . with the stars , a superstar 's critique of celebrity###culture could be taken as somewhat hypocritical of course . mr . bowie has always had an ambivalent attitude toward fame . his biggest american hit of the 1970s , fame , was a harrowing dispatch from inside the paranoid bubble of stardom . he 's often returned to the subject , as with his 1999 album 'hours ... , ' an exploration of fame as injury , in the words of the bowieologist nick stevenson , and the new album 's ( you will ) set the earth on fire , the sales###pitch of a svengali to a potential prot###g . mr . bowie 's career has been governed by a bipolar rhythm , alternating between relentless###pursuit of the limelight and shattered retreat from it . now , after his longest musical break ever , this 66 year old englishman and new york resident is back for what could well be his last blast , the supernova of his stardom . yet while mr . bowie himself receded for the past decade , the bowie esque has been omnipresent . after the '90s , a period dominated by the grit and authenticity of grunge and gangsta###rap , the 2000s saw the return of artifice and glitter . the things that mr . bowie explored to the hilt , alongside his fellow glam rockers like roxy###music and alice###cooper , during the early '70s over the top theatricality and staging , extremist fashion and sexual androgyny became defining principles of 21 st century pop . lady###gaga is the most visible of his inheritors , with her freaky costumes and her gender games ( the male alter###ego jo calderone the artfully concocted rumor that she 's a hermaphrodite . adam###lambert , the american###idol graduate , called his first major tour glam nation . beyonc made a ziggy###stardust like gambit by creating the persona sasha###fierce as a vehicle for her walk on the wild side impulses . above all there 's nicki###minaj , whose guises include the gay male roman zolanski and the ultrafeminine cartoon she calls barbie . while it 's unlikely that ms . minaj is directly###influenced by mr . bowie , the parallels between his serial personas and her constant image changes are clear . as a host on the music channel fuse put it , she says she 's just being herself , but who she is changes every day . among mr . bowie 's most famous pronouncements early in his career were i feel like an actor when i 'm onstage , rather than a rock artist , and if anything , maybe i 've helped###establish that rock 'n' roll is a pose . before mr . bowie came along , rock defined itself against showbiz and hollywood . there was supposed to be a more or less direct correspondence between the performer and his real###life personality . but mr . bowie talked about playing characters , such as the rock god ziggy###stardust , or the cold , remote thin white duke . like a movie star taking on different roles that refract a fundamental , unchanging charisma , mr . bowie , in his heyday , was paradoxically the same and yet different each time he came before the public with a new album and tour . mr . bowie embraced metamorphosis from the start . in the mid '60s he hopped through five bands and many styles and looks before connecting with the public around . once his career took off , the shape###shifting took on a new urgency . popular###taste is fickle , but mr . bowie circumvented pop 's cruel turnover by turning himself into the new thing , again and again . as he said in my policy has been that as soon as a system or process works , it 's out of date . i move on to another area . perhaps the fashion world has so lionized mr . bowie ( gucci is a sponsor of the london exhibition ) because he has so thoroughly assimilated fashion 's own logic of remorseless supercession . but there 's more to mr . bowie 's compulsive changeability than a career strategy . what he was really developing during the '70s was a new postmodern psychology based around flux and mutability . his great precursor and influence here was warhol , the inspiration for his 1971 song andy###warhol and a role mr . bowie would actually play in the 1996 biopic basquiat . analyzing warhol , the art###critic donald###kuspit wrote of the protean artist self with no core a description that could also fit mr . bowie .
columbus , ohio urban###meyer started with a notepad , the first page blank . he scribbled oc and drew a line underneath . same with dc . and ol . those headers stood for various assistant positions offensive###coordinator , defensive###coordinator , offensive###line###coach and underneath them , meyer wrote the names of potential###candidates . he kept the list on him , in his suit pocket , as he analyzed college###football games for espn in . he tracked statistics , made notes in the margins , scratched names off . meyer figured he would eventually coach again , and he knew that his next head###coaching job , his fourth , would be different . his staff would not be stocked with loyal assistants who understood the meyer way and its demands . to that end , he hurriedly assembled a group of relative###strangers when he took over at ohio###state and then kept the group intact for a second season . together , they have won 19 straight###games , their next challenge coming saturday against penn###state . all that started with his list . it produced an eclectic mixture , this ohio###state staff , a collection of nine main assistants unlike any other in college###football . one offensive###coordinator is a mensa member , although he cannot remember if he paid his most recent dues . the defensive###line###coach played 14 seasons in the n.f.l . and has three super###bowl rings . one defensive###coordinator was a wrestler who became an interim###head football###coach . the strength coach doubles as the unofficial staff therapist . collectively , they hold more than 200 years of experience , at all levels , from high###school to the n.f.l . they took a team ranked 81st in the football###bowl###subdivision in scoring in 2011 to seventh in , took an offense ranked 107th in yards per game to 20th . they garnered a number of top recruiter awards in the off season . their makeup and the way meyer stitched them together in a matter of weeks is one important , underrated aspect of ohio###state 's return to national###championship contention . meyer , 49 , knows their life . he lived it . he made , 000 a year and drove an old grand am and slept for months on a friend 's couch . he saw the size of staffs grow , along with the salaries###paid to assistants and their responsibilities and impacts . they do n't get enough credit , meyer said at his office this month during the buckeyes' bye###week . they are more important now than they 've ever been . they spent the bye###week huddled around white boards . they diagramed plays and downed coffee and argued schematic changes . they listened to and for the footsteps of the boss . they are the assistants . ohio###state practices on three fields , two outdoor and one indoor , and sometimes on all three at once . meyer often stands in the center of the outdoor fields , the assistants scattered among position groups the hub of the wheel , then , surrounded by its spokes . they connect meyer 's philosophy , his grand###plan , to the players who will implement it . familiarity , the foundation for cohesiveness , is important . this staff had little of that at first . yet in , the team had the sixth no loss season in its history . in previous stops at florida , utah and bowling###green , meyer always hired his guys , familiar assistants who understood his detailed operation . eventually , most of his guys became head###coaches , including four from the 2005 florida staff , which meyer once boldly called the best maybe in college###football history . as he assembled this new group , meyer worried about strangers , about agendas , and he called friends and friends of friends for background###checks . uninterested in doling out seven figure paychecks , he turned down big name guys , like really big###names who inquired about positions . he wanted coaches with local ties , who understood the tradition at ohio###state . he also paid attention to the coaches' wives . he had seen others create conflict in our programs . his first call went to mickey marotti , his strength coach and sounding###board , his proverbial right hand .
the creepy thriller the truth about emanuel deals with loss and heartbreak and madness and mortality , the writer and director francesca gregorini said recently . every artist is haunted by specific###themes , and those , for better or for worse , seem to be mine . ms . gregorini , 45 , was born in rome and is the daughter of barbara###bach a former bond###girl , model who appeared in a playboy pictorial , and who later married ringo###starr and augusto gregorini . as a filmmaker , she is deeply###interested in the various ways humans wound and redeem each other . her second feature , the truth about emanuel , which opens in theaters on jan . 10 and is available now on video on demand , follows 18 year old emanuel ( kaya###scodelario ) as she becomes troublingly devoted to linda ( jessica###biel , a new neighbor who bears an eerie resemblance to emanuel 's mother , who died in childbirth . linda hires emanuel to babysit for her infant daughter , and together the two women cultivate a charged partnership . ms . gregorini originally wrote emanuel for rooney###mara , who aged out of the part while the filmmakers were securing###funding . ms . scodelario is best known for her work on the british television###series skins . the movie indulges certain horror conventions , and its most unsettling narrative concerns the disorienting power of love what it blinds us to , how we manage its loss . when you 're hungry to be loved and hungry to belong , you kind of go there unquestioningly , ms . gregorini said . that 's a beautiful###thing , but also a dangerous and detrimental thing . i wanted to explore that , devoid of judgment . ms . gregorini spoke with amanda petrusich on the phone from los###angeles . these are excerpts from their conversation . q . fantastical###elements aside , how personal was this story for you ? a . emanuel encompasses a lot of my struggles as a youth . i had a mother who was absent although not dead , thank god in different ways throughout my childhood . that 's a big theme in my life . i was able to explore that through emanuel , while the character of linda encompassed some of my struggles as an adult . obviously , i 'm not as out there as linda or not yet , anyway . but both of those characters are pieces of me , and i decided to put them in the same movie and have them work it out . it was a very expensive form of therapy . sometimes , when you 're invested in a story psychically , the work changes . very early on in the filmmaking process , a movie takes on a life of its own . it has demands and needs . you switch seats from being the almighty creator of this thing to being in service of it , and in some ways , that represents motherhood . you make this baby , and then before you know it , you 're subject to it you have to have a really clear###vision of what it is that you 're doing , but at the same time have the let go to see what it wants to become . have you shown the film to your mother ? i have , and she 's so supportive . because she 's an artist in her own right , she 's very respectful and appreciative of my process . now she 's the stage###mother i never had . she 's so proud . as a kid , and even as an old kid , that 's all you want for your parents to think you 're the bee 's knees . coming of age as a theme speaks to me . one could argue that i 'm still stuck there myself . but all the different moments where we come of age , those transitions are so rich because they 're painful . you have to take a big###leap forward . i 'm drawn to that because it 's full of drama . you ca n't go somewhere without losing something . you have to leave things behind . again , it 's about loss and heartbreak . all those things that do n't###kill us , they make us stronger . i love that .
as the n.b.a . trading###deadline approached thursday###afternoon , the knicks sent 27 year old guard ronnie###brewer to the thunder for a draft###pick . that left the knicks with a roster###spot to fill , and a few hours later they said they were going to sign 35 year old forward kenyon###martin , who has yet to play an n.b.a . game this season . by replacing brewer with martin , the knicks , who started the season as the oldest team in n.b.a . history , got even older . surely a team that in the off season signed rasheed###wallace , a 38 year old who had been out of the n.b.a . for two years , has more vision than that . here are some suggestions . seeking big###man with shorts , man of a certain age preferred , even older o.k. , full set of teeth not really required . the knicks , my team , god help me , had a job opening , having traded ronnie###brewer , a once ambulatory small###forward who transformed himself into a gimpy statue , for a second round###draft###pick , which is the n.b.a . equivalent of fish chum . so , how should they have filled that roster###spot ? let 's start with height and age , as the knicks needed a big###man , and ancient is how the knicks roll . our big###men include rasheed###wallace , who has been sitting on the bench , listed as day to day since 2009 with a minor foot problem that could result in amputation . and there 's marcus###camby , who was injury###prone when he was a young stud in the 1990s . young is no longer his problem . why not page walt###bellamy ? he last played in , and is n't that the point ? he 'd be hungry to get back into the game , assuming he remembers the game . he was an all star , he rebounded and scored , and he was cantankerous , which makes him a perfect roomie for j . r . smith . but do n't rule out nate###thurmond , john gianelli ( knicks backup center mid 1970s i rode the crosstown bus with him once , greg fillmore ( greg was the 136th pick of the 1970 n.b.a . draft and 7 feet###tall , and i had such high hopes until i saw him play . c 'mon , gentlemen , whoever adjusted his hearing###aid and got james dolan on the phone first deserved the job . michael powellif the sacramento###kings move to seattle , the supersonics will get their chance at a comeback . the knicks could have given a similar comeback to one of seattle 's signature stars shawn###kemp . the reign man was last seen in a 2009 episode of pros vs . joes , but played###professionally as recently as , when he joined premiata montegranaro of the italian league . although that stint failed to have lasting power kemp appeared in just three preseason###games he was reportedly in shape , which should come as a surprise to anyone familiar with kemp . a six time all star , he forced his way out of seattle over contract demands , ate his way out cleveland , played his way out of portland and then saw his n.b.a . life peter out in one last season in orlando . but kemp has mouths to feed ( at least seven of them ) and made some waves last season when he described blake###griffin 's posterizing dunk over kendrick###perkins as just a layup , giving him motivation to play hard for the knicks . even if he can no longer play at the level of a star , at 43 years young he would at least have served as a cautionary###tale for iman###shumpert , a young###player with a similar preference for acrobatic dunks and stylish hair . benjamin hoffmanto consider any other players for an open roster while the greatest point###guard of his generation , according to him , is available seems like a waste of everyone 's time . since leaving the knicks , stephon###marbury has led the beijing###ducks to the 2012 chinese###basketball###association championship , giving him the winning pedigree that the knicks desire . his moment of international triumph will live on forever , as a statue was commemorated of his celebration . the man with a tattoo on the side of his head depicting the logo for his personal sneaker brand ( which may or may not still exist in china ) was previously an n.b.a . star as well , averaging . 7 points and . 1 assists a game for the 2004 5 knicks , numbers that even jeremy###lin fanatics would have to admit were strong . provided the discussion never turned to character , marketability or dependability , it is hard to see how this signing could go wrong . the real advantage of signing marbury , however , would be to give the basketball world an opportunity to finally answer the question of who is better marbury or jason###kidd . in a rivalry that seemed to exist only in marbury 's head , the talkative former star often declared himself superior to kidd . this would give him the chance to prove it . benjamin hoffmanm . j. ! he 's already come back two times , why not a third ? he had some of the best games of his career which is to say , of anyone 's career at madison###square###garden . the double nickel . the playoff sweeps . that dunk over ewing . he owned new york without ever living here think what he could do if he called manhattan home . coming back at 50 to play under the glare of new york 's brightest lights would have been a bold move . perhaps a foolish one . but jordan , the best there ever will be , as the statue says , is nothing if not bold , and some of his post basketball moves certainly qualify as foolish . he would have instantly been the biggest celebrity in a city jam###packed with them , making our interest in a rod and tebow look like silly dalliances . we would have watched jay z squirm as he struggles to square his lyrics ( i 'm the mike jordan of recording ) with his nets allegiance . he 's already got his steakhouse in grand###central , one of the city 's finest landmarks . why not set up shop in a far more exciting temple across town ? sam dolnickthe knicks are no strangers to signing aged superstars . it 's what they do . so why do n't they throw it all the way back and give walt clyde frazier a look ? all that yoga and the off seasons in st###croix have surely kept him limber and relaxed . his vocabulary is certainly stronger than ever . maybe his teammates would be the beneficiaries of his altruistic percolations . maybe together they could have bedeviled overzealous opponents and found themselves rejuvenated and omnipresent in the second half . what about rhyming ? do the knicks have any capable rhymers on their roster ? maybe he could have initiated some huffing and stuffing . or even some swishing and dishing . even at his advanced###age he surely could have helped them outhustle and outmuscle a lackadaisical opponent . with the trend in sports toward alternate jerseys , frazier 's sartorial instincts might also have come in handy . how about a cow print shooting shirt ? maybe a new wildcat patterned away ensemble from mohan 's custom tailors for the stretch run ? the possibilities are endless . it might have even be worth it just for the postgame spreads at clyde frazier 's wine and dine . it 's within walking###distance from the garden and the pan roasted mahi###mahi sounds delicious . fred biermanspree ! he was the last good thing to happen to the knicks , the rare player whose attitude managed to embody the city 's spirit . he was scrappy , elbows and arms flapping every which way along with his braids . he led a not very good team , an eighth###seed in the playoffs , to the n.b.a . finals in . he would have added some swagger , some surprises , and sure , some menace , to a team that can look as if it 's sleepwalking some nights . he would probably have gotten along famously with j . r . smith . and let 's be honest , he needs a break . he was arrested on new year 's eve in milwaukee for disorderly###conduct after neighbors complained that his music was too loud . it 's safe to say that if spree moved back to new york , the neighbors would not complain . that was only the latest setback for the would be savior his home was foreclosed a few years###ago , he 's had serious tax problems , and the u.s . marshals auctioned off his 70 foot yacht . so we would be saving him , just as much as he would be saving us . new york at its finest . sam dolnickhe was known to guzzle diet cokes on the sideline . he would n't crack six feet in heels . and his best known move on the hardwood involved riding the leg of a rival 's star center during a brawl . but the knicks could use jeff###van###gundy , their 51 year old former head###coach , who once starred at nazareth college in rochester , leading the team to the 1984 n.c.a.a . division###iii eastern regional championship . though a news article from 1996 appraised van###gundy as slight and unheralded as a player , his 87 percent career free###throw###percentage at nazareth would place him third on the current knicks second among those without a full head of hair . ( sorry , jason###kidd . ) knicks fans will recall that the van###gundy led teams of the late 1990s paid more than occasional mind to defense . he must also be commended for having the foresight to resign as coach in , evading the imminent decade of losing , the isiah###thomas era and the hoops trinity of eddy###curry , jerome###james and jared###jeffries . matt flegenheimer

chicago mark montgomery never noticed this about tom###izzo . not that he could . between playing for michigan###state when izzo was an assistant , then serving as an izzo assistant for 10 seasons until , montgomery had too much else going on to scrutinize izzo 's sideline mannerisms . last friday , montgomery , now the coach at northern###illinois , stopped by united###center and watched michigan###state come back in the second half to beat iowa , 59 56 , in a big###ten###conference tournament quarterfinal . his seat behind the spartans' bench provided a fresh vantage###point to watch izzo , and that is when he saw it . when michigan###state ran its offense correctly , izzo , in a barely perceptible gesture , rapidly nodded his head up and down . ( imagine the lightest possible tap on the top of a bobblehead doll . ) when play flowed the wrong way , the nodding switched to a side to side no , then returned to a yes when the players corrected themselves . it 's reassuring the guys that they 're doing the right thing , montgomery said in a telephone interview saturday . i think he was doing it to the officials , too . few coaches prepare their teams to win in march as consistently as izzo , through 16 consecutive n.c.a.a . tournament bids , 6 final###fours and a national###championship ( in . no other coach has been to as many final###fours in the last 14 seasons . and since the 1998 99 season , izzo 's teams are 71 29 in march . but izzo nodded less last saturday , when the eventual###tournament champion ohio###state eliminated the spartans , 61 58 , in a semifinal . afterward , izzo criticized the spartans for not playing smart . adreian payne , undercut by his teammate derrick nix while trying to block a shot , grabbed the rim and was called for basket interference , handing the buckeyes 2 points . with 1 minute 27 seconds###left and the spartans down by , nix pulled down buckeyes guard aaron###craft as he drove the lane . the flagrant###foul call gave ohio###state two shots craft made one and the ball . michigan###state prides itself on rebounding , but the spartans could not get one on the ensuing###possession , and deshaun###thomas hit a jumper for a###4 point lead with 22 seconds###left . izzo felt that certain players too often let their egos affect their judgment . surrounded by reporters outside the locker###room , izzo still in a gray pinstriped suit and green print tie made his point plainly . i 'd like my players to grow up a little bit , he said . there 's no bad###blood , just personal confrontations that take place . it 's not disrespect or anything . if that is curbed and used in the right way , it 's a motivating###factor . i thought it got too personal , like on the playground you score so i score . you ca n't do that . i think we need a little more discipline right now . we have enough toughness . in the intensely competitive big ten , michigan###state ( 25 8 ) did enough to earn the midwest region 's no . 3 seed and the next best thing to a home###game . the spartans meet no . 14 valparaiso on thursday in auburn###hills , mich . i 'm looking forward to playing anybody , izzo said . i 'd play the lakers tomorrow instead of some of the teams i 've###played recently . how far the spartans advance depends on how well izzo prepares them . much of the groundwork was done long before the spartans showed up at united###center . usually it starts in november and december , when izzo sprinkles his nonconference schedule with tough opponents . this season the spartans played connecticut at an air###force###base in germany ( a loss , the eventual big 12 champion kansas in atlanta ( a victory , and the eventual atlantic###coast###conference champion miami in coral###gables , fla . ( a loss . and texas came to the breslin center ( a victory . izzo is not the only big ten coach who schedules this way , but it works . izzo 's players usually develop toughness and togetherness during their rugged big ten schedule . this season michigan###state faced ranked###teams in half its 18 conference games , going .
chicago before wednesday 's tip off at united###center , lebron###james lay on a towel in the miami locker###room as a team assistant helped him stretch . james rapped along to a song on his ipod as his thighs were kneaded and his long limbs were pushed and pulled . nearly 20 reporters and cameramen watched his every movement . after the chicago###bulls stunned the heat , 101 97 , to end their 27 game winning###streak the second longest###streak in n.b.a . history and six games short of the record set by the 1971 72 los###angeles###lakers james had another moment in the locker###room , this one much more private . i had everyone come in and put a hand on each other , heat coach erik###spoelstra said . it was the first time i talked about the streak . james said we have n't had a moment to really know what we just did . we had a moment , just very fortunate and very humble and blessed to be a part of this team and be a part of a streak like this . the bulls sprinted to an early lead , as many teams had done recently against the heat . they led by double###digits for much of the first half and held a 9 point edge at halftime . but a 13 3 third quarter spurt gave the heat their first lead of the game , 59 58 , with 4 minutes 30 seconds###left in the quarter . rather than fold , the bulls stiffened , something no other team had done during miami 's run . boston led the heat by 17 in the second quarter on march , and cleveland held a 27 point second half advantage two nights later . neither cushion was enough . with the game tied at 69 69 early in the fourth###quarter , miami appeared###poised to go on another run , and remind the league that they were good enough to spot opponents large leads and come back at will . instead , it was chicago that found an extra gear . as the minutes ticked away , the wait for the heat to turn into that familiar squad of steel nerves and ruthless efficiency became cheer after cheer as the bulls hit big###shot after big###shot . luol###deng sank a 3 pointer to make the score 78 73 and another to make it . jimmy butler drilled a third long range basket to put the bulls ahead , 86 78 . suddenly , the crowd was chanting , beat the heat . and with belief . the heat never threatened again . deng led the bulls with 28 points , carlos###boozer had 21 and butler added . the last time the heat had lost was feb . 1 to indiana . the streak spanned 53 days , beginning in toronto on super###bowl sunday , and captivated the n.b.a. , as james raised his already electric game to another level . he was terrific again wednesday , scoring 32 points on 11 for 17 shooting from the field . dwyane###wade returned after missing two games with a knee bruise and scored . it was not enough . despite an 86 67 miami victory over chicago in late###february , the gritty , defensive###minded bulls posed a test for the heat . before wednesday 's game , spoelstra spoke of the challenge rather starkly . we 're preparing for an absolute cage fight mentality game , he said . chicago obliged . indicative of spoelstra 's assessment was a first quarter play in which james went one on one against kirk###hinrich on a fast###break . james lowered his shoulder and hinrich took it in the chest , while also giving james a bear###hug . both players tumbled to the floor , hinrich was whistled for a foul and the home###crowd erupted . chicago was short handed , playing without derrick###rose , who has yet to return after tearing an anterior###cruciate###ligament during last year 's playoffs , and the all star center joakim###noah , out with plantar###fasciitis . it did not matter . a thunderous round of boos greeted james when he was announced , but it was nothing compared with the raucous scene as the fourth###quarter clock ticked down . fans stood , and the arena seemed to shake . despite the heightened media attention , and presence , as the heat inched closer to history , james said the weight of the streak was not an issue . we were n't pressing every game saying we have to win so we can get the streak , he said . soon , the heat will turn their attention to a larger prize , in the playoffs . it has never been about the streak , spoelstra said . we have had a bigger goal in mind .

it was her derri###re that first caught my eye . specifically , it was the way the camera captured the pretty teenager 's rear###end in blue is the warmest color so that it was centered and foregrounded in the frame . it is a lovely derri###re , no question , round , compact and firm , and i became well acquainted with how it looked whether tucked into snug jeans or perched prettily in the air when ad le , who 's 15 when the movie opens , lies splayed sleeping face down in bed , as young###children often do . the director , abdellatif###kechiche , i realized fairly###quickly , likes a tight###end . mind you , i thought the same about mike###nichols , given the attention he lavished on natalie###portman 's rear in his 2004 film , closer . this observation was a data point that i stashed in my files , where i 've also noted that alfred###hitchcock preferred blondes , and quentin###tarantino likes pretty feet . for the most part , this information does n't factor into my thinking about these filmmakers , even if it is unsettling to hear tippi###hedren brand hitchcock as a sexual###predator . the truth is , if i were hung up about every predatory director or every degrading image of a woman , i could n't be a film###critic . so i watch , loving movies that do n't###necessarily love or even like women . does it matter that mr . kechiche appears to have a thing for rear ends ? mr . kechiche , after all , elevated one such rear into art , or so the consensus was in may at the cannes###film###festival , where blue is the warmest color won the palme###d'or . in an unusual move , the jury , led by steven###spielberg , awarded the palme to mr . kechiche and his stars , l a seydoux and ad le exarchopoulos . this exceptional step , mr . spielberg said as he announced the winners , was taken to recognize the achievements of three artists . by asserting that the actresses were co creators of the movie , the jury had acknowledged that movies are also made by their performers , an idea that gently chips away at auteurism , one of the critic 's favorite interpretive strategies . blue is the warmest color , which has now opened in the united###states , is a sexual coming###of###age###story about a french provincial voluptuary , ad le ( ms . exarchopoulos . she 's a teenager with strong appetites she keeps sweets stashed under her bed whose hunger has a distinctly carnal aspect and invokes an association between literal and sexual appetite that has probably been around since eve took a bite of that troublesome apple . ad le stuffs her mouth with food , even as she remains unnourished by her high###school boyfriend . she 's only sated when later she falls for emma ( ms . seydoux , the blue###haired artist with whom she forms a bond as emotionally and psychologically intense as it is sexually pleasurable . they fall in love , move in together , and then it falls apart . i first saw blue is the warmest color at cannes , where i wrote 399 dissenting words on the movie and raised some of the issues i had with it . i wrote that mr . kechiche was a self indulgent filmmaker ( the movie runs three hours , and mentioned a scene in which a man talks about art and female orgasms . primarily , i questioned mr . kechiche 's representation of the female###body . by keeping so close to ad le , he seemed to be trying to convey her subjective###experience , specifically with the hovering camerawork and frequent close###ups of her face . yet , early on , this sense of the character 's interiority dissolves when the camera roves over her body even while she is sleeping . is ad le , i had wondered then , dreaming of her own hot body ? i received flak for my comments , which was unsurprising because i had criticized a movie that other people love , raising###questions about pleasure and a director whose desire felt more at stake than that of his characters . some critics decided that i was really complaining about pornography , which was surprising because , while the movie uses some of that genre 's conventions , it 's clear that the sex was pantomimed . in june , owen###gleiberman , from entertainment###weekly , wrote a long blog post in which he took issue with my comments and those of julie maroh , who wrote the graphic novel on which the movie is based . by that point , she had weighed in on mr . kechiche 's adaptation , calling it coherent , justified and fluid . but she also expressed unhappiness with the sex scenes with ad le and emma . it appears to me that this was what was missing on the set lesbians . mr . gleiberman took this to mean that ms . maroh was saying that real lesbians should have played the roles , although that is not what she wrote . what she did write was that except for a few passages this is all that it brings to my mind a brutal and surgical display , exuberant and cold , of so called lesbian sex , which turned into porn , and made me feel very ill at ease . ms . maroh saw a connection between the way mr . kechiche shot the sex scenes and another scene in which characters talk about what she called the myth of the feminine orgasm as mystic and far superior to the masculine one . she added but here we go , to sacralize once more womanhood in such ways . i find it dangerous . she was raising a red flag about an essentialist view of female###sexuality , in which women , with their holy orgasms , are thought to embody an innate and eternal mystery . in the second sex , simone###de###beauvoir termed this the mythic idea of the eternal feminine , one that does not account for the multiple existence of women . ms . maroh 's description of the sex scenes as both pornographic and conveying a sense that women are sacred might seem contradictory , except that both the pornographic and the sacred generally treat women as abstractions instead of flesh and blood individuals . pornography involves real###sex and has one blissfully obvious objective to turn viewers on . blue is n't a blue movie it 's just a formally standard example of european art cinema that comes with the usual ambitions , pleasure and art included . even so , i can see why someone might find it pornographic given the visual conventions that mr . kechiche used , including close###ups that assert that , as a journalist , liza katzman , once said of pornography , the drama of a woman 's pleasure is written not on her genitals , but her face . from the start , mr . kechiche puts us spatially close to ad le , a proximity that i think is meant to create , to borrow a phrase from george###eliot , the extension of our sympathies . yet if my sympathies did n't extend , it 's partly because mr . kechiche employs a selective aesthetic that shows ad le slurping her food ( you 're voracious , emma says ) but , importantly , does not permit her a similarly sloppy appetite in bed , where the movie 's carefully constructed realism is jettisoned along with bodily excesses and excretions in favor of tasteful , decorous poses . this may be what ms . maroh meant when she said the sex scenes were missing lesbians i 'd go further and say they 're missing women of any kind . ad le 's hunger is contained , prettified , aestheticized .
landover , md . given that the new york giants were once 0 6 with injuries mounting , it 's quite the feat that they 're not the first team to be eliminated###from###playoff###contention in the nfc###east . the giants are soldiering on with postseason hopes###alive in december , having won five of six , while the washington###redskins are officially going nowhere . new york rallied from an early two touchdown deficit to beat washington 24 17 sunday###night , keeping the giants ( 5 7 ) two games behind division leaders dallas and philadelphia with four to play . we 're almost accustomed to putting ourselves in bad situations , said giants defensive###end justin###tuck , who had four sacks in the second half . the redskins ( 3 9 ) wo n't be repeating their nfc###east title . they 've###lost four straight and wo n't be in the playoffs for the 17th time in 21 years . the nfl gave them five prime time games this season they lost all five . when you 're out of it , yeah , it 's very disappointing . ... you do n't like to play for pride , washington coach mike###shanahan said , but sometimes that 's the card that 's dealt , and that 's where we 're at right now . here are five morsels from the game that separated hope from no hope streaky eli eli###manning had a streak of 10 completions , including a 22 yard touchdown pass to brandon myers in the second quarter that tied the game at the half . he also a high throw tipped for his 18th interception and remains on course to have more interceptions than touchdown passes for the first time since his rookie###season . the redskins had three sacks , which means manning has been brought down a career###high 31 times this season . but manning 's final numbers were n't too shabby 22 for 28 for 235 yards and it 's hard to ignore the back to back clutch throws to myers ( 18 yards ) and victor###cruz ( 19 ) that set up andre brown 's 1 yard touchdown run that put the giants ahead for good early in the fourth###quarter . streaky rg griffin completed his first 12 passes and was running the read option as if it were 2012 all over again . then , for the second consecutive###week , a redskins opponent adjusted and shut him down . griffin was 16 for 17 for 149 yards in the first half and just 8 for 15 for 58 yards in the second . his final line 24 for 32 for 207 yards and a season high 88 yards###rushing on 12 carries . he was n't sacked in the first half , but he went down five times after halftime . you do n't want to take your foot off the gas pedal , redskins guard kory lichtensteiger said . they were able to answer back , and we knew they had the weapons to do that . offensively , we had to score more , and we came up short . i guess we 'll have to own up on that one . tuck rules tuck was one of the symbols of the underperforming giants with only 2 sacks on the season until he brought down griffin four times . jon beason tied a career###high with 17 tackles in a game played without defensive###end jason###pierre###paul ( shoulder ) and cornerback corey###webster ( ankle , just the latest in a constant parade of new york injuries . if i was standing here with four sacks and a loss , i would n't give 2 cents , but we got a win , tuck said . i played pretty good tonight . snap judgment the redskins are good for at least one special teams gaffe per game , and this one swung the momentum . long###snapper kyle nelson sent a bouncing grounder back to punter sav rocca , leading to a blocked###punt that traveled 18 yards and was compounded by a holding penalty on nelson that added 10 yards to the final spot . the giants took over at washington 's 46 and needed only four plays to score the go ahead touchdown . what down was it ? the redskins were driving for a possible tying###score in the final###minutes when the chain###gang goofed , setting up as if washington had made a first down when the officials were signaling third down . the mistake altered the redskins' play calling , but they ended up getting the necessary yards anyway with a fourth and , 6 yard pass to pierre garcon only to have garcon stripped by safety will hill , allowing new york to run out the clock . even so , shanahan was clearly bothered by the sequence when asked about it after the game . i told him i wanted a measurement , because i knew it was close . it was inches . and he said , 'no , it 's a first down . ' and he moved the chains , shanahan said . and then after i saw it was fourth down , i asked him , 'you already told me it was first down . ' he did n't say anything . so that was quite disappointing .
chicago the boston###bruins ' captain , zdeno chara , is the tallest###player in the n.h.l. , and maybe the meanest , his reputation as intimidating as his 6 foot 9 frame . in the eastern###conference###finals , he delivered a punch to the chin of the pittsburgh###penguins' sidney###crosby , who had recently###returned from a monthlong absence after jaw surgery . the quebec government once held a criminal investigation into a hit he made on max###pacioretty of the montreal###canadiens . chara , 36 , is also perhaps the premier defensive###force in the n.h.l . he was awarded the norris###trophy as the league 's top defender in , and two years later , he helped boston win the stanley###cup . he is a reliable workhorse the last time he averaged fewer than 22 minutes of ice time was in , when he was 21 and playing for the islanders . before the stanley###cup###finals began , chicago###blackhawks players spoke of chara 's ability and strength as the leader of a defense that had allowed only two goals by the high flying penguins in a four game sweep . his size , reach , knack for bullying and his ever looming presence made him a force in front of the boston net , they said . chicago , in deference to chara , put its top forwards , jonathan###toews and patrick###kane , on different lines in an effort to give one a chara free matchup . the bruins won two of the first three games and shut out the blackhawks in game 3 in boston . in game , chicago changed course . toews and kane were paired with bryan bickell , a big and physical forward , though he still gave up five inches to chara . the blackhawks also took a different tack with chara , engaging him rather than running from him . bickell was particularly aggressive , and chicago 's offense roared to life . chara was on the ice for five of chicago 's six goals and finished with a minus 3 differential , his worst in a game since january . between games 4 and , toews brazenly suggested he and his teammates had a blueprint for neutralizing him . he 's not a guy that we should be afraid of , toews said . we should go at him . bruins coach claude julien responded , if that 's what they think , then they should try it again . the blackhawks were indeed at it again in game 5 on saturday###night in chicago , challenging and frustrating chara in a 3 1 win that put them on the cusp of winning the stanley###cup . the series returns to boston for game 6 on monday###night . on chicago 's first two goals , both scored by kane , chara was on the ice and in arm 's length of kane . the first came in the opening period on a deflected shot from johnny oduya that broke the stick of boston 's dennis###seidenberg before bouncing past goaltender tuukka###rask . as kane stuffed the puck into the net , chara watched from across the crease . chara played a more central role in the blackhawks' next goal . in the second period , bickell skated behind the net and slipped a pass right by him to a cutting kane . chara waved helplessly at kane with his stick while kane buried a backhanded shot in the top of the net . he covers a lot of areas , so you do n't see that too often , bickell said . he 's an elite defenseman in this league , but we 've been getting our chances and capitalizing . chara had a moment of redemption when he blasted a perfectly placed one timer past the glove of corey###crawford in the third period to cut the deficit to a goal , but the bruins did not get any closer . chara was later on the ice for dave###bolland 's empty net goal in the final###seconds , finishing with a minus 2 differential . he had not been minus 5 in back to back games since february of last season . after the game , chara met with reporters in the boston locker###room . he was curt and then surly . asked about being on the ice for so many goals , chara replied , that 's not normal , but it just happens they 've been scoring some goals . pressed on whether he had an explanation , he responded , i 'm not here to talk about myself . chara is averaging nearly 30 minutes of ice time in the playoffs , the most of any player to advance past the first round . he has now been on the ice for eight of the last nine goals given up by the bruins . the blackhawks like the new math , a byproduct , they say , of their new attitude . there is a fine###line between respectful and being overly respectful , defenseman duncan###keith said .

clinton bamberger lost the most important case of his career , but most legal###experts consider that 1963 united###states###supreme###court decision a crucial victory for criminal###justice . everybody thinks i won it , said mr . bamberger , 87 , now a professor emeritus of law at the university of maryland . he represented john l . brady , a death###row###inmate , in brady v . maryland , in which the justices ruled that prosecutors are obligated to provide defendants exculpatory###evidence material either to guilt or to punishment . on monday , the 50th anniversary of the decision , the texas house is scheduled to vote on a law some legal###experts say would help ensure that the ruling 's tenets are carried out to help prevent wrongful###convictions . texas was way behind , said barry###scheck , a co founder of the innocence###project , a group dedicated to exonerating wrongfully###convicted prisoners . this bill is a pretty big###step forward . the bill , known as the michael morton act , is named for mr . scheck 's highest###profile texas client . mr . morton was convicted in 1987 of his wife 's murder , and spent more than two decades in prison before being exonerated on the basis of dna###testing . the bill would require prosecutors to disclose evidence in their files to defendants accused in criminal###cases . lawmakers and experts said they hoped the legislation would clear up gray areas that remain in the brady ruling five decades after it was issued . in defending mr . brady , mr . bamberger said , he had just hoped to save the prisoner 's life . mr . brady and a friend , donald boblit , were sentenced to death for the 1958 murder of william brooks . in questioning by the police , mr . brady consistently said that mr . boblit was the killer . mr . boblit gave five different statements , and mr . bamberger discovered that only four were given to mr . brady 's lawyers during the trial . in the fifth statement , mr . boblit admitted guilt . when mr . brady appealed his conviction , a maryland court said he should have received that fifth statement and granted him a new trial , but only to decide his punishment . mr . bamberger asked the supreme###court to give mr . brady a new trial to decide both guilt and punishment . the court denied the request for a trial but allowed a decision on his punishment . eventually , the sentence was commuted to life , and mr . brady was released on parole . they did not reverse the court , but in the course of writing the opinion , they wrote the brady rule , mr . bamberger said . the brady rule had been in place for more than two decades when , lawyers for mr . morton have said , the prosecutor in his case withheld critical###information that could have prevented his wrongful###conviction . dna###testing in 2011 led to mr . morton 's exoneration . since then , mr . morton has lobbied for new laws that could prevent such wrongful###convictions . a rare court of inquiry determined that ken###anderson , the former prosecutor who oversaw mr . morton 's conviction , should face###criminal###charges for withholding the evidence . mr . anderson , now a williamson###county state district judge , has appealed . at the court of inquiry , mr . anderson said he was sure he would have told mr . morton 's lawyers about the evidence in 1987 even though he believed he was not required to give it to them under brady rules . that view of brady has dominated prosecutorial practice , said jennifer e . laurin , a professor at the university of texas at austin school of law . ( the university of texas at austin is a corporate###sponsor of the texas###tribune . ) courts have decided that verdicts would be overturned because of brady rule###violations only if the evidence withheld would have altered the verdict or sentence . so , many prosecutors came to view brady as requiring only the disclosure of information that could change the outcome in a case . ms . laurin said that such an interpretation requires prosecutors , who are typically convinced of a defendant 's guilt , to imagine how the evidence could show the opposite . factors that suggest there 's a problem with the state 's case are very naturally not going to seem very powerful , she said . with the proposed###legislation , lawmakers hope to reduce chances for prosecutors to overlook evidence of innocence . the law would require prosecutors to give defense lawyers access to evidence in the state 's file without regard to the information 's potential impact on the verdict . it telegraphs legislators' intent that they want prosecutors to err on the side of disclosure , mr . scheck said . that 's how you take care of this problem .
( reuters ) the best rafael benitez could say about his time at chelsea was that he left with the grudging and muted respect of even his most vituperative critics . the spaniard arrived at stamford###bridge against a backdrop of hostility but walked away from the fans , who greeted his arrival with vociferous abuse , with his reputation enhanced . benitez , who took over as coach of serie a team napoli on monday , led chelsea to europa###league glory and helped them finish third in the premier###league , thereby qualifying for next season 's champions###league . on paper , chelsea represented something of a poison chalice for benitez . unloved and unwanted by those upset at the dismissal of terrace hero roberto###di###matteo in november , he had to guide a club that finished###sixth last season into the top four . having unfairly gained a reputation as a troublemaker in previous###roles , failure could have scuppered any lingering hopes he had of getting another top job elsewhere . as it was , his tactical ability to organise , combined with meticulous attention to detail , qualities chelsea had perhaps lacked under di###matteo , helped steer what was a listing ship through a perilously rocky period . the spaniard was never going to be popular with chelsea fans , after robbing them of the opportunity to play in two champions###league finals in his previous guise as manager of liverpool . benitez had also poured salt into supposed wounds with comments alluding to the atmosphere at stamford###bridge and comparing it unfavourably to the feral roar of anfield on a european night . the clincher , however , in the swivel eyed logic of chelsea fans seemingly intent on handicapping their own chances of success , was that benitez had replaced one of their own and the guy who won them the champions###league in may . little thought was given to the fact that it was not benitez who had sacked di###matteo and ensured the seeds of stability were not given the chance to germinate . as the months wore on and the club 's prospects of success###continued on an upward###curve , even the hardest of chelsea hearts softened . while there was no collective outpouring of gratitude at his departure , smatterings of appreciation surfaced during the club 's final premier###league game against everton . benitez had , as required , guided the club back into the champions###league and added european silverware to the trophy cabinet . the europa###league title , claimed with victory against benfica and a goal straight from the benitez training###ground tactics , will be an achievement written in the record###books for posterity . the context of his time spent in the chelsea hot###seat , however , shows the manager 's role went above and beyond the application of his undoubted tactical nous . benitez took the hostility in his stride and even used it to gain some leverage within the club . his plea for calm aimed at angry fans after a routine fa###cup victory at middlesbrough in february was initially labelled a rant by british media . in hindsight it proved a shrewd move that earned him respect from players and prompted a rethink from the majority of chelsea fans . benitez also successfully###managed to ease to one side two of the club 's elder###statesman in a way that avoided open###warfare . in the face of repeated questions about the phasing out of club greats frank###lampard and john###terry , benitez managed to distance himself from the dirty coalface that had blackened andre villas###boas 's time in charge the year before . lampard 's ongoing contract issue was sidestepped as a matter for the club rather than the embattled interim###manager . terry , seen as a powerful dressing###room and pitchside influence under di###matteo , had his role recast from talisman to cheerleader without the fireworks that could have ensued had the player taken public umbrage . benitez also unravelled another knotty problem when he figured out what to do about david###luiz , a marauding defender whose frequent forays upfield and habit of giving away silly free###kicks and penalties made him a liability at the back . playing the brazilian in midfield was a logical solution but one that previous managers shunned rather than embraced and the player grew in stature . amid the lather of excitement caused by jose mourinho 's expected###return , it is unlikely any chelsea fan will cast a backwards glance in benitez 's direction . his achievements are frequently overlooked in the game but they deserve repeating . two la###liga titles and a uefa###cup with valencia , champions###league , fa###cup , uefa###super###cup , fa###cup at liverpool , fifa###club###world###cup at inter###milan and the europa###league at chelsea . benitez has given the impression he craves a return to liverpool where he reached two champions###league finals within three years of arriving and

philadelphia federal###prosecutors on thursday unveiled fraud charges against nine sitting and former philadelphia traffic court judges accused of dismissing or reducing traffic citations for political , business and social associates in return for favors like free car repairs and shipments of seafood . the judges , as well as three business associates , were charged in an indictment unsealed thursday with conspiracy , mail###fraud and wire###fraud . they were accused of taking part in a scheme in which tickets issued for offenses like speeding were thrown out or converted to lesser offenses , or the recipient was found not guilty . those seeking to have their traffic###tickets fixed including local###politicians and associates of the democratic city committee would regularly contact the defendants from july 2008 to september , the indictment said . the defendants would then either agree to the request for preferential###treatment or hand the case to another judge who would eliminate or reduce fines or points on a driver 's license , depriving the city and state of revenue , prosecutors said . defendants created and participated in an extrajudicial system , not sanctioned by the pennsylvania court system , the 77 count indictment said , where they felt free to approach one another and exchange requests for preferential###treatment or 'ticket fixing , ' without being rebuked or criticized by fellow judges . all but one of the judges face a maximum###sentence of more than 100 years in prison and millions###of###dollars in fines if convicted on all counts , according to the office of zane david memeger , the united###states###attorney for the eastern###district###of###pennsylvania . one defendant , fortunato n . perri , a senior traffic court judge , is accused of arranging to fix tickets referred to him by another defendant , henry p . alfano , a philadelphia businessman who owns an automobile salvage###yard and two gentleman 's clubs . prosecutors said mr . alfano supplied judge perri with traffic citation numbers , the names of offenders or the actual citations . in return , mr . alfano provided###free auto repairs , free towing , free videos and free seafood to mr . perri , prosecutors said . another defendant , michael j . sullivan , a sitting traffic court judge and bar###owner , was accused of directing associates who wanted their tickets fixed to leave them in a box behind the bar . they were assured that the tickets would be taken care of . i know you 're broke , judge sullivan told a ticket recipient , according to an intercepted telephone conversation cited by prosecutors . it do n't matter which judge would be hearing the case , because you 're good . justice j . michael eakin of pennsylvania###supreme###court issued a statement on thursday expressing confidence in the traffic court system despite the indictment . philadelphia traffic court remains###open , and newly###assigned senior magisterial###district judges from various counties have been appointed to hear###cases , justice eakin said . but the state senate###majority###leader , dominic pileggi , said the indictment supported proposed###legislation to abolish the court . traffic court is not worth###saving , he said . the judicial conduct board of pennsylvania said it had petitioned the court of judicial discipline to suspend the six sitting judges without pay . three defendants judge michael###lowry , the former judges robert mulgrew and thomasine tynes are also charged with committing perjury before a federal grand###jury that investigated the case . a former judge , willie singletary , and william hird , the court 's former director of records , are charged with lying to the f.b.i . about ticket fixing , in addition to the mail and wire###fraud charges . mr . singletary , who was elected to traffic court in november , led supporters in a local motorcycle###club named the philadelphia first state road rattlers to believe that he would offer them preferential###treatment if they donated to his election campaign , prosecutors said . if you all can give me , you 're going to need me in traffic court , am i right about that ? he told the club , according to the indictment . you 're all going to need my hookup , right ? another defendant , a local###businessman , robert moy , advertised ticket fixing in a local###newspaper , saying that he tackles the traffic###ticket and guarantees no points or fewer###points , the indictment said . prosecutors said that ticket recipients took their citations to mr . moy , paid him hundreds of dollars in cash , and were instructed not to appear in traffic court , where they were found not guilty by either judge tynes or judge singletary .
detroit sales of new cars and trucks cooled considerably in september , as fewer selling days during the month and generally weaker demand led to a.2 percent###decrease from a year ago . the drop , which was larger than expected , was the first time since june 2011 that automakers failed to generate year over year increases in sales in the united###states market , which has been recovering steadily since the recession . executives and analysts stopped###short of predicting a slowdown in the overall comeback of the industry . but the tepid sales###figures could worsen if the government###shutdown hurts consumer###confidence in the economy . automakers said they sold . 14 million new vehicles during september , compared with . 19 million in the same month last year , according to the research firm autodata . despite the setback , the industry remains on pace to sell 15 million to 16 million new vehicles this year . one analyst said consumers might be pulling back slightly on new car purchases because of broader economic###concerns . the thunderclouds came sooner than expected , said art spinella , an official with the firm cnw research . sales took a serious tumble in september . the automakers said much of the shortfall occurred because part of the labor###day###weekend fell during august this year , depriving september 's figures of two busy###days of sales . september 's performance can be attributed to the timing and strength of the labor###day###weekend , said erick merkle , an analyst the ford###motor###company . it was hard to calculate the impact on sales of the political gridlock in washington that prompted a partial shutdown of the federal###government on tuesday . government workers may be reluctant to buy cars during the shutdown . a suppressive ripple###effect on stocks and investments could also keep other prospective###buyers away from dealer showrooms . should this turn into a prolonged situation that lasts several weeks or more , expect to see the sales pace take a hit in october and the months###ahead , said alec gutierrez , an analyst with the car buying guide kelley###blue###book . over all , september was a speed###bump for an industry that was getting used to a pattern of consistent growth . many automakers have increased manufacturing production to keep pace . and companies are making substantial profits because of higher###prices on new models . the average transaction price in september was , 854 , which represented a 5 percent increase from the same month a year ago , according to the auto web###site truecar . com . while september 's sales did n't###match those of the summer months , the prices buyers are paying continue at a record pace , said jesse toprak , an analyst at truecar . most of the major automakers reported decreases in sales for the month , with the exception of ford and chrysler . general###motors , the largest american automaker , said it sold , 000 vehicles during the month , a decrease of 11 percent from a year ago . some new models , like the cadillac###ats sedan and buick encore s.u.v. , sold well in september . but sales of its recently redesigned chevrolet###silverado pickup dropped . 8 percent , as the company struggled to ship sufficient inventories of the new models to dealers . ford , the second biggest of the detroit car companies , bucked the sales trend in september . the company said it sold , 000 new cars and trucks , which was a.7 percent increase over last year . sales were strong across ford 's lineup . sales of its fiesta subcompact###car rose . 5 percent , and its midsize fusion sedan was up . 4 percent . and in contrast to g.m. , ford reported a.8 percent increase in pickup sales . chrysler , the smallest of the american manufacturers , sold , 000 vehicles , including fiat models , which was a.7 percent gain over the same month in . among its strongest performers were its ram pickups and jeep sport###utility###vehicles . the major japanese###automakers all posted declines , ranging from a.3 percent###decrease at toyota to . 9 percent for honda . while the september results were disappointing , they were hardly severe enough to darken the industry 's outlook . analysts said the high quality of new models and the financial###strength of most major automakers were evidence that the market was much more stable than it had been in years . with the japanese###automakers fully###recovered from the 2011 tsunami , and with the u.s . automakers back to full strength after their restructuring efforts , the market seems to be settling down , said karl brauer , a kelley###blue###book analyst .
early last year , alaska 's wild###salmon fishing###industry decided to end its partnership with the seafood world 's most prominent sustainability certification group in favor of its own labeling efforts . but the move quickly set drew a reaction from customers , as walmart and others said they would no longer buy alaskan salmon without the independent check . now , the alaskan salmon industry appear to have won the fight , recently saying that it was standing firm in its decision to drop the outside certification group . for years , the group , the marine###stewardship###council , has been the blue seal of approval for seafood products . the fast###food###chain mcdonald 's relies on the council to verify the origins of its fish sandwich . then in , the alaska seafood marketing institute created its own label in collaboration with an irish group , global trust , reasoning that the state 's reputation for sustainable fishing was good enough for most environmentally###conscious consumers . the state 's seafood marketers took the step to save###money and reduce what they considered to be outside interference in a thriving###business . but someone forgot to check with walmart . the world 's largest###retailer told its suppliers in june that it would no longer buy alaskan salmon sourced from fisheries that were not certified by the stewardship###council or an equivalent group . the company noted in a statement that , walmart has not yet determined any other standard to be equivalent to m.s.c . the reaction of walmart , a major customer for alaskan fisheries , was like a slap in the face . the company , in essence , suggested that alaska was ducking independent certification of its fishing practices . adding injury , sodexo , a giant food services company that has contracts to supply the military , followed suit , raising the prospect that alaskan seafood would be supplanted by fish from russia and other fisheries certified by the stewardship###council . even the national###park###service , whose guidelines called for fish certified by the stewardship###council to be served under its jurisdiction , seemed to be abandoning alaska . with its . 4 billion seafood industry under siege , alaska came out swinging . the industry portrayed itself as a victim of walmart 's anti american purchasing policy and foreign###interference in the fishery . ( the stewardship###council is based in london . senator mark###begich of alaska , a democrat and chairman of the subcommittee on fisheries , convened a hearing sept . 24 to question the companies that were threatening to stop buying alaskan salmon . the state 's other senator , lisa###murkowski , a republican , introduced a bill to prohibit federal###agencies from requiring seafood to be certified by any third party . since then , the companies appear to have backed down . while sodexo has not formally###accepted the local###industry certification , the company has hinted it is prepared to compromise . laura schalk , a spokeswoman in paris , said on friday that alaskan salmon continues to be on the menu in sodexo facilities . a senior walmart executive testified that the retailer was re examining its decision and would have a final###answer before the end of the year . last week , the salmon industry essentially declared###victory , saying it would move forward with its own labeling efforts . in a clear swipe at walmart , the salmon industry urged the few remaining buyers with m.s.c . only buying policies to stop swimming against the tide . alaska has the idea of sustainability built into its constitution , senator begich said in an interview , referring to a provision in the state charter , which says natural###resources must be managed on the sustained yield principle . he dismissed the idea that the industry needed more outside oversight , noting that the national###marine###fisheries###service , part of the national###oceanic###and###atmospheric###administration , closely monitors american fisheries . seafood certification###programs are meant to reassure consumers that seafood is being watched from bait to plate . the stewardship###council seeks to ensure the catch is set at levels that keep fish###stocks healthy and that there is no significant###harm done to other species like seabirds and marine mammals . but critics argue that many such programs are little more than exercises in greenwashing , endorsing dubious environmental claims in exchange for corporate dollars . the salmon dispute recalls a recent battle over forestry products , which forestethics and greenpeace , two advocacy###groups , argued before the federal###trade###commission . in may , the groups claimed that a certification group originally###formed by timber interests , the sustainable forestry initiative , was certifying timber products even when they had been harvested with destructive methods . both the stewardship###council and alaska 's homegrown certification cite their reliance on principles developed by the united###nations food###and###agriculture###organization . still , critics have expressed###skepticism about the new alaskan standard . i 'm not really a fan of the m.s.c. , but i think everyone would agree that it 's more credible than the new standard , john hocevar , ocean campaigns director at greenpeace , said . i 'm not superimpressed with the idea of the alaska seafood marketing institute deciding what is and is n't sustainable . by dismissing the stewardship###council , the alaskan industry says it will save###money , but neither it nor the council indicate exactly how much . in addition to the cost of certification and the chain of custody audits that are carried out by third party contractors , the stewardship###council charges from about . 3 to . 5 percent of the wholesale value of the catch for the right to use its logo , a substantial###sum . certification costs for the new alaskan body are similar , according to tyson fick , a spokesman for the alaska seafood marketing institute . there is no charge for the use of the logo , he said . the stewardship###council declined to comment but in an open###letter , kerry coughlin , the council 's director for the americas , said the alaska seafood marketing institute had attempted to discredit m.s.c . in order to gain###acceptance of its own program , and that critics' descriptions of its certification costs were ridiculously inflated . john renner , the operator of two fishing###boats and vice###president of cordova district fishermen united , an alaskan industry lobbying group , said the council had undercut its own reputation , and thus the value of its seal , by giving the same grade to russian fisheries as those in alaska . that gives them the m.s.c . logo and puts them on the same footing in the market as us , he said , even though the russian fishery was in worse shape , and russian boats faced vastly lower labor and regulatory costs . mr . renner said alaskans do n't take kindly to outsiders coming in to tell us what is and is n't sustainable . if the stewardship###council wants to manage something , he said , tell them to go manage atlantic###salmon .
because it 's not the cheeriest of topics , advertising for products that treat women 's urinary###incontinence tends to steer clear of medical###terminology . poise , a kimberly###clark brand , uses the term light bladder leakage , while tena , an sca personal###care brand , uses one that could just as easily describe the kitchen###sink , unexpected leaks . while their euphemisms differ , the brands have shared a strikingly similar approach in stressing absorbency . both assign their products an absorbency rating on a scale of 1 to , with poise ultimate absorbency and tena ultimate absorbency representing their most substantial offerings . now tena has decided that the absorbency approach is pass . it is removing references to absorbency from the names of most of its urinary###incontinence products , and renaming them with what it calls lifestyle terms active , stylish and anywhere . discover fearless protection for the unexpected leak , says a spokeswoman at the beginning of a new commercial for the brand . designed to fit your lifestyle . three women dance ecstatically while presumably wearing the products . stylish is form###fitting , the spokeswoman says , as a woman is shown in a short chiffon dress . active moves with you , she continues while a woman is shown in comfortable pants and a jersey . and anywhere gives all day comfort , she adds , as a woman is shown professionally attired in a skirt and blouse . the commercial , by the joey company in brooklyn , was introduced monday , and the campaign also includes print , radio and online###advertising . tena , which declined to reveal advertising expenditures for the campaign , spent . 8 million on all united###states advertising in , according to the kantar###media unit of wpp . robert w . wilson , vice###president of consumer sales for sca personal###care in north###america , said the brand was taking###cues from baby diaper brands , which have long marketed products like pampers cruisers and huggies little movers . focus###groups indicated that technological language such as absorption used on incontinence product###packaging does not resonate , said mr . wilson , adding that consumers are looking for a more intuitive approach to get products that fit with their lifestyle . although the new designations may not telegraph efficacy to everyone , the meaning may be clearer to those with the problem . what 's interesting about the new approach , mr . wilson said , is that consumers played back to us that they intuitively understood the absorption levels of each of these , that stylish is the least absorbent , active is more absorbent , and anywhere is the most absorbent . tena will keep absorption terminology for higher absorbency lines , since as many as 40 percent of those purchases are made by caregivers who prefer more literal descriptions , mr . wilson said . about 25 million american adults experience some form of urinary###incontinence , and as many as 80 percent are women , according to the national###association for continence , a nonprofit group with a memorable toll###free###number , 1 800 bladder . the cause is often weakened pelvic###floor muscles , which can stem from pregnancies and childbirth , menopause and weight###gain . nancy muller , the executive###director of the group , reviewed the new advertising and marketing approach by tena , and said , moving away from the degree of severity or degree of absorbency makes###sense because it dovetails with the quality of life concerns that baby###boomers in particular have . ms . muller was less impressed with the coinage of unexpected leak by tena , whose parent###company is a financial###supporter of her organization . the term 'unexpected leak' has an underlying###message that , 'this just happened to you and there 's nothing that you could have done , ' said ms . muller , whose organization promotes pelvic exercises to reduce and prevent incontinence . kimberly###clark , with both the poise and depend brands , commands a.1 percent share of the . 35 billion adult incontinence products market in the united###states , followed by sca personal###care with a.1 percent share , according to data for the 52 weeks ending march 24 compiled by symphonyiri group , a market###data firm . store###brands collectively account for a.5 percent share . tena , which estimates that more than half of women with the condition use feminine care###products instead , is as interested in redirecting those consumers to the category as in luring them from competing###brands . poise in the last year has stressed the link between an overactive###bladder and menopause , introducing a series of videos called the 2nd talk that encourage the same sort of frank conversations about menopause that parents have with adolescent###girls about menstruation . the brand has also introduced menopause products beyond the scope of bladder health , like a cooling roll on gel and towelettes for hot###flashes . the tena campaign , pitched to women ages 35 to , does not emphasize menopause , because , as the brand says in marketing materials , the unexpected leak is not an age thing , it 's a stage thing . advertising for difficult topics often takes a humorous approach , but not so with the new tena campaign . we wanted to avoid humor and create advertising that was inspiring and empowering , said joey cummings , chief###executive of the joey company . the unexpected leak can put women in that situation where they say , 'geez , maybe i wo n't have that cup of coffee until i get to the office , ' but what 's being celebrated here is you do n't need to compromise . new radio ads aim to reach female commuters who worry about having a problem while traveling . if you 're in a car , you 're not necessarily accessible to a restroom , ms . cummings said . it 's a captive###audience in more ways than one .
( reuters ) hockey fans were still catching their breath on thursday after the chicago###blackhawks beat the boston###bruins in a game one triple###overtime stanley###cup thriller that has already been labeled a classic . chicago 's 4 3 comeback win will long be remembered by anyone who witnessed the pulsating four hour drama unfold on television or inside a packed united###center . but the bruins will be trying hard to forget as they look forward to game two on saturday and leveling the best of seven series . the blackhawks were forced to play what amounted to almost two complete###games to get one victory , andrew shaw ending the fifth longest###game in stanley###cup###final history with his goal 08 of the third overtime###period . exhausted players left the ice to a thundering ovation but some were back at the united###center on thursday to fulfill media obligations , tired but no so weary they could n't crack a joke . to tell you the truth , ( i ) fall###asleep around 00 . woke up early , shrugged blackhawks' slovakian forward marian hossa . i think my neighbor decided he ( was ) going to drill in the morning . you know , hopefully ( he ) is going to get his message for next time , he wo n't drill . we are lucky , we got extra day , you know , to recharge the batteries and get back on game two . for the bruins , recovering physically from the draining contest may be easier than recovering mentally after watching a 3 1 lead with 12 minutes left in regulation disappear into a gut###wrenching loss . while admitting that losing in triple###overtime stings , bruins coach claude julien was searching for some perspective after the crushing defeat . last time we won the cup , we lost the first two games to vancouver , recalled julien . it never stopped us from coming back . this certainly wo n't . with a little bit of luck , we could have ended it before they did . some nights you get the break going your way , some nights you do n't . for the bruins the challenge is straightforward refocus and stop agonizing over missed###opportunities and what might have been if they had capitalized on just one of their many chances in overtime . just minutes before shaw 's decider , bruins kaspars daugavins could have penned a very different result but with chicago goaltender corey###crawford sprawled across the ice the latvian could n't put the puck in the open net . there 's no question that it 's a tough###loss , said bruins adam###mcquaid . at the same time , it was a game that could have gone either way . take the positives from it . today is a new day . we kind of start over and just have to get ready for game two . the real winners on wednesday were the fans , who had been left bitter and disillusioned when a nasty labor dispute very nearly resulted in no season until a last minute deal was struck to salvage a 48 game season . owners and players promised they would reward fans for their patience and loyalty and on wednesday two original six rivals delivered a stanley###cup###finals opener for the ages . the nhl reported that game one received a.8 household###rating , which is the best metered market rating for a stanley###cup###final game one since 1997 but there were other signs people had been captivated by the breathless marathon . as game went on the twitter verse was abuzz with everyone from the white###house to the rolling###stones drawn into the unfolding drama . u.s . president###barack###obama , a chicago backer , offered good luck to the nhlblackhawks tonight hope to welcome you back to the white###house again as stanleycup champs . bo while rolling###stones frontman mick###jagger showed his colors donning a bruins jersey and posting it on instagram . both teams wanted to win that game and no one was going to give it up easy , said blackhawks captain jonathan###toews . we 're obviously feeling pretty good about it .

washington martina###hingis and the rest of the washington###kastles wasted no time putting on the red t shirts , the ones that proclaim that they 're now at the top of the list among the longest winning###streaks in major u.s . pro sports history . and they even got congrats from the los###angeles###lakers . the kastles of world###teamtennis won their 34th consecutive###match tuesday###night , routing the boston###lobsters . their streak is one better than the storied run of the 1971 72 lakers , a team that included wilt###chamberlain and jerry###west . we made history . tonight is magic , said coach murphy###jensen , sporting a white###hat with the number . this experience has been beyond belief . these guys have made a masterpiece , and this team will never be forgotten . such hyperbole is a matter for debate , considering that the wtt typically is n't considered a major sports league and that its top players appear only in selected matches , creating an atmosphere more comparable to that of a fan friendly minor###league baseball###team . the lakers , on the other hand , had an undisputed landmark achievement that continues to stand as the high###water###mark for the nba , nhl , nfl and major###league###baseball . still , winning 34 in a row on any level is n't###easy . among those tipping a hat to the kastles was lakers executive jeanie buss , who was involved with world###teamtennis in the 1970s as an executive for the los###angeles strings . winning 33 consecutive###games was an amazing accomplishment by our 1971 72 lakers team , as evidenced by the fact that no other team has come close to reaching it for over 40 years now , buss said in a written###statement . on behalf of the buss family and the lakers family , i want to congratulate the washington###kastles , their players , and our good friends ( wtt co founder ) billie###jean###king and ( wtt commissioner ) ilana###kloss on this milestone accomplishment of theirs . the streak has brought invaluable publicity to a###league that packs its entire###season into a three week###span in july . jensen 's squad is 2 0 this season and is coming off back to back wtt titles , going undefeated both years . washington 's last loss came on july , 2010 , also against the lobsters . they 've become the streamroller of the league . i 've been really lucky to have had a great olympic career and a great davis###cup career , said the kastles' leander###paes , who remains one of the top doubles players in the world . and this is exactly like that . the streak has included both venus and serena###williams , although neither is playing for the kastles this year . venus###williams was supposed to make the occasional###appearance as the star player in , but she dropped out with a lower back injury . she was on hand to support her teammates monday###night when the streak reached , following the customary white###house visit with president###barack###obama to celebrate the kastles' 2012 title . first###lady###michelle###obama also attended monday 's match . with neither williams on the squad , hingis is now the kastles' marquee###player in her first year with the team . the 32 year old swiss , who won five grand###slam###singles###titles in the 1990s and will be inducted into the international###tennis###hall###of###fame this month , paired with anastasia###rodionova to win the women 's doubles and with paes to take the mixed###doubles . hingis then cruised past jill craybas 5 2 in women 's singles , pumping her fist and getting a big hug from jensen after craybas' shot landed long to end the set . we tried to beat the kastles with my old team . we always got close , hingis said . so if you ca n't###beat them , join them . paes and bobby###reynolds wrapped up the match by winning the men 's doubles 5 2 in front of a crowd that nearly filled the kastles' , 000 seat stadium along the d.c . waterfront . chamberlain , west , jim###mcmillian , gail###goodrich , pat###riley and flynn###robinson all scored###in###double###figures when the lakers won their 33rd in a row on jan . 7 , 1972 , a 134 90 victory over the atlanta###hawks that improved los###angeles to . the streak ended two nights later with a 120 104 loss to the milwaukee###bucks , who were led ironically by 39 points from future lakers icon kareem###abdul###jabbar . perhaps the best reminder of the lakers at the stadium tuesday was the kastles' public###address###announcer , who announced the game on stilts , making him more than 7 feet###tall . streaks also come with superstitions , and kastles owner mark ein was no exception . he donned the same brown dress###shoes he wore when the team captured the 2009 title , the day that coach jensen had all the players put pieces of tape on their shoes to symbolize team unity . before the match , they called me over and said i had to wear it , too , ein said . the small###pieces of white tape are still on ein 's shoes . i definitely can never wear these into a meeting again , he said , so i figure at least i can wear them out at kastles stadium . i 've broken them out four or five times for big matches .
paris the last car rolled off the assembly###line at psa###peugeot###citro###n 's factory in aulnay###sous###bois on friday , marking the end of four decades of production at the auto plant on the outskirts of the french capital . faced with a shrinking domestic###market and burning through cash , peugeot is shutting the plant at a cost of , 000 jobs , part of a restructuring###plan meant to save . 5 billion###euros , or . 1 billion , by next year . the company says closing the plant is essential for reducing overcapacity , a problem for many european carmakers , as plants that operate below maximum###efficiency may lose###money on every car they produce . the company has five other big automotive plants in france , and aulnay 's importance had declined amid ebbing profitability for the subcompact cars it produced . of a total . 9 million vehicles peugeot made worldwide last year , only , 000 came from aulnay . it was the then separate company citro###n that opened the aulnay plant in , beginning production with a ds model . three years later it combined with peugeot to create the current company , psa###peugeot###citro###n , which currently ranks as the no . 2 carmaker in europe behind volkswagen . psa###peugeot###citro###n , which also includes the auto###parts maker faurecia and peugeot 's finance unit , employs more than , 000 people worldwide , including about , 000 in france . over the years aulnay has produced nearly . 7 million vehicles , the last car friday a citro###n c3 supermini . the plant will limp on for a while , making metal parts until it is completely mothballed early in . production of the c3 will continue at poissy , just northwest of paris . peugeot predicted this week that the car market in the 28 nation european###union would shrink about 4 percent this year , and it is desperately looking for ways to gain###access to growing economies beyond europe . to that end , it has been talking with the french government and its chinese partner , dongfeng###motor , about the possibility of replacing the founding peugeot family as its largest investors , according to a reuters report this month . those negotiations are complicated by the fact that general###motors owns a 7 percent###stake in the french company and has its own agenda in china . philippe varin , the peugeot chief###executive , declined to discuss the dongfeng question friday at a news conference . as for aulnay , he said , the company was standing by a pledge made last year to accompany every employee toward an employment solution . already , 100 of the affected employees have been transferred to other positions within the company , he said , another , 100 had found jobs with other companies and 500 had retired or entered retraining programs . but jean###pierre mercier , an official of cgt the largest union at peugeot disputed mr . varin 's account , saying the situation among the aulnay workers was much worse than the company was acknowledging . management wants to convey the idea that everything is fine , do n't###worry , mr . mercier told lci television . but a claim by mr . varin that 90 percent of those who have lost their jobs at aulnay had found new employment or are getting retraining , he said , is a lie , another lie from management . the real figure , he said , is 40 percent , and the aulnay workers will pursue the company in labor court over the conditions of the layoffs . the closing of the plant , announced in july , came as a painful shock for the northern###suburb of aulnay###sous###bois , which is in an area where good jobs are scarce amid france 's 11 percent unemployment###rate . politicians in president###fran###ois###hollande 's government , including the outspoken industry minister , arnaud###montebourg , publicly took the company to task over the plan , but later acknowledged that it was a commercial and financial necessity for the company to cut capacity . recognition of the gravity of peugeot 's challenges led to important concessions from workers on thursday , when some of the company 's unions agreed to accept lower overtime pay , a wage freeze and greater willingness to change jobs within the company in return for the promise of a share of future profits and job###security . even that agreement was contentious , though . just four of the company 's six unions signed . two , including the cgt , refused .

london wimbledon entered the twilight###zone on monday as serena###williams became the latest high###profile champion to fade into oblivion at a tournament where reputations and star status are counting for nothing . just when it seemed that this year 's grass###court major had exhausted its quota of shocks with grand###slam champions rafa nadal , roger###federer , maria###sharapova and victoria###azarenka all blotted out of the draw by the second round , along came sabine###lisicki . the german , playing fearless tennis , jettisoned american holder williams 6 2 1 6 6 4 to leave wimbledon gasping in disbelief once again . i 'm still shaking , i 'm so happy , gulped a tearful lisicki , who fell flat on her stomach in her moment of triumph . it 's amazing , i love this court so much . it 's unbelievable ! it certainly was unbelievable because even before the first week exodus of big###names , top seed williams had been the overwhelming favourite to win a sixth###title at the all england club having triumphed at three of the last four majors . she also walked on court on a 34 match###winning###streak but her exit left world number four agnieszka radwanska as the highest###seed and czech petra kvitova as the only former champion still alive in the women 's draw . it 's not a shock . i did n't do what i do best , summed up williams , who relinquished her crown despite winning nine games on the trot to take a 3 0 lead in the final set . while williams was left to pack away her orange hotpants , world number 24 lisicki proved that when she turns up at wimbledon , her game catches fire . she has now reached at least the quarter###finals in her last four appearances . sabine was on today . she 's always on against big players and big courts . she just has a super , super game to play well on grass , added 16 times major winner williams . men 's top seeds novak###djokovic and andy###murray also feel at home on the lush###green turf and both survived second set wobbles to stay on track for a hotly anticipated final . djokovic ended the run of evergreen 35 year old german tommy###haas with a 6 1 6 4 7 6 ( 4 ) win and murray knocked out russian mikhail###youzhny . eighth###seed kvitova dispatched spaniard carla suarez navarro 7 6 ( 5 ) 6 3 to set up a last eight meeting with belgian kirsten###flipkens and radwanska made it a good day for poland by outlasting bulgaria 's tsvetana###pironkova . william 's downfall also meant that sloane###stephens was the only american , man or woman , to reach the quarter###finals . the 20 year old lived up to her billing as america 's next big hope by beating puerto###rican teenager monica###puig . at the other end of the age spectrum , li###na proved that 31 year olds can still do damage on grass by thrashing italian 11th seed roberta###vinci . day seven at wimbledon is unique as it is the only one of the four grand###slams to schedule 16 fourth###round showdowns both in men and women 's singles on the same day . but after a week of seismic shocks left the draw shorn of house hold names , it was a case of 'guess who ? ' for the fans who wandered around the outside courts . oh it 's a couple of nobodies ! , quipped one spectator as he craned his neck to see the names on the on court scoreboard . had the fan stuck around to the end of the match , he would have caught sight of the latest dance###craze to hit wimbledon kubot doing his comical 'can###can' victory jig following an absorbing 4 6 6 3 3 6 6 3 6 4 win over frenchman mannarino . kubot and mannarino were among four players outside the top 100 who had made it to the second monday . but kubot was the only one to survive as 166th ranked flavia###pennetta succumbed in straight###sets to flipkins and another italian , 104th ranked karin###knapp , lost to former finalist marion###bartoli . poland waited 33 years for a male grand###slam quarter###finalist but two arrived within minutes of each other . the nation that boasts radwanska as a wimbledon finalist will have one man in the semis after kubot set up an unlikely last eight date with 6 foot 8 jerzy###janowicz , who blasted down 16 aces to edge past juergen melzer . britain had also been anticipating a double celebration as for the first time since , home interest was still alive in both singles draws on the second monday . but hopes that u.s . open winner murray and laura###robson would both reach the last eight were dashed when the 19 year old robson bowed out 7 6 ( 6 ) 7 5 to estonia 's kaia###kanepi . the road to the final opened up for murray following the demise of federer and nadal and having played the highest###seed he can face before the final , number 20 youzhny , expectations that he will end britain 's 77 year wait for a men 's wimbledon champion are rocketing . standing in his way next is world number 54 fernando verdasco . gentle###giant juan###martin del potro made it through to his first wimbledon quarter###final and will face fourth###seed david###ferrer . former finalist tomas berdych warmed up for the daunting prospect of facing djokovic on wednesday with a 7 6 ( 4 ) 6 7 ( 5 ) 6 4 6 4 victory over australian bernard###tomic .
scientists have identified four distinct###species of anniella , legless###lizards in california , including anniella grinnelli , the bakersfield legless lizard . this species , which has a purple belly , is found mostly in the southern san###joaquin###valley . the findings were reported last month in the journal breviora by theodore papenfuss and james parham , who used dna###testing to distinguish the species , which they named after natural historians who documented california 's biodiversity .
years of jostling among television###networks for the first on camera interview of amanda###knox ended on monday with abc emerging as the victor . diane###sawyer , the anchor of abc 's world news , will conduct the interview of ms . knox , which will be televised in prime time on april , the network announced . a book by ms . knox , waiting to be heard , will be published the same day . ms . knox , an american college student studying###abroad in perugia , italy , was convicted###of###murdering her housemate in , then freed two years later when an appeals###court overturned the judgment . her case has been covered in painstaking detail by the american television###networks . one of ms . sawyer 's colleagues , elizabeth###vargas , led the coverage on abc , which included several prime time specials . of the many crimes involving americans overseas , this one captivated the news###media because ms . knox came across as an attractive###girl next door yet was accused of heinous###crimes and lurid sexual###behavior . producers for nbc , abc and cbs have been fighting to secure interviews with ms . knox for years , partly by getting to know her family members and friends . during the appeals trial there was a dispute over whether an abc producer baby sat two daughters of curt knox , ms . knox 's father . mr . knox said the producer was very kind to offer to let the girls stay in her hotel###room during court sessions but did not baby sit . mr . knox said that his daughters also stayed in the room of a cbs producer and that an nbc producer offered the same treatment . some of the producers were on the same flight as ms . knox when she returned to the united###states in october . ms . knox retained robert barnett , the washington lawyer who represents many authors , politicians and television reporters , to negotiate a book deal and the first television interview . such interviews are seen as a critically important way to sell books . the book deal was with harpercollins , a subsidiary of news###corporation . then the bargaining with the television###networks began . at various times in , when television producers were asked to name their most sought after interview subject , they almost uniformly named ms . knox . the networks generally say that they do n't###pay for interviews , but they have been known to license photos , videos and other materials from interview###subjects . abc cracked down on the licensing practice in mid , and a spokesman said on monday that ms . knox was not compensated in any way for the interview . what abc could and did offer , instead , was an hour in prime time teases of the interview on world news , the newly first place morning show good morning america , nightline , and abc 's local###tv and radio affiliates and exposure on yahoo through abcnews . com 's alliance with that popular search###engine . within the industry this is called the package . nbc and cbs also offered such packages to mr . barnett and ms . knox . but she chose abc and ms . sawyer , who has obtained several other book related interviews in recent###years , including one with gabrielle###giffords in 2011 and one with jaycee dugard in .
following backlash over the rocky institution of a new student assessment system last spring , texas lawmakers are scrambling to scale back the requirements they passed four years###ago . as the legislature tackles such reform , attention is also focused on another area of education policy high###school###graduation requirements . wrapped up in legislation that reduces the number of state mandated standardized exams are several measures that redefine the curriculum prescribed for a high###school###diploma in favor of loosening the required###courses for graduation . the plans have received support from superintendents and public###school educators , who say the new flexibility would give students the ability to focus on their interests and encourage them to continue their education . industry and trade groups are also supportive , saying the changes would get people with the skills they need into the work force sooner . but some state education officials and business###leaders said they worried that such legislation could sweep away a decade 's worth of hard won progress in improving students' preparation for college and careers . the concern about too much testing has been conflated with the curriculum itself , and i think those two issues need to be just disaggregated , said raymund paredes , the commissioner of the state 's higher###education###coordinating###board . michael###williams , the texas###education###agency commissioner , has also expressed###concern . at a february meeting of the university of texas system board###of###regents , he implored higher###education leaders to speak up on potential changes to high###school###graduation requirements he said he feared that some of the proposals could erase some of the gains in public education . the state requires high###school###students graduating on the recommended plan about 70 percent of students to complete four credits each in science , social###studies , english###language arts and math . the legislature approved the so called 4x4 curriculum , which took effect during the 2007 8 school year , in an effort to improve students' preparation for higher###education . for other students , there is a minimum plan with looser requirements . the state has advanced in that area , although it is still behind where many educators said it should be . in , 52 percent of students met the state 's college ready standards , which are based on standardized###test###scores in english and math , compared with 35 percent five years###ago . among economically###disadvantaged students , who represent the increasing majority of public###school enrollment , 32 percent met the standards , compared with 18 percent five years###ago . despite that progress , there has been a push to make sure career properly balances college in the career and college ready equation and that the rigidity of the current plan does not create an insurmountable barrier for students who want to go directly into the work force . but officials disagree about how to do that . some said they believed the current system provided the academic exposure needed to succeed in higher###education , and some wanted more opportunity for high###school students to explore different pathways to careers . measures from education leaders in the legislature including jimmie don aycock , republican of killeen , the house public education chairman dan###patrick , republican of houston , the senate education chairman and kel seliger , republican of amarillo , the senate higher###education chairman move the state away from the 4x . though their bills vary , each would require###fewer years of math , science and social###studies in favor of allowing###students to earn diploma endorsements by completing additional credits in areas like humanities , engineering , and business and industry . the state high###school###graduation requirements have become inflexible to the point that it thwarts career###development and student choice , mr . aycock said this week at a hearing where teachers , superintendents and parents from across the state proposed changes to state testing and graduation requirements .
london a bbc broadcaster was told to quiet down by a player at wimbledon on monday when his on air segment interrupted her fourth###round###match . kirsten###flipkens of belgium stopped play to complain to the umpire during the second set of her win over flavia###pennetta that a journalist standing on a roof overlooking court 18 was speaking too loudly . flipkens gestured angrily up toward john###watson , who was presenting a segment on bbc###world###news . after chair umpire fergus murphy asked the gentleman who 's broadcasting in the brown suit to be quiet , watson looked slightly bemused as he realized the comments were directed at him . looking into the camera , watson said this is a very surreal moment , and i do n't think i 've ever been told to be quiet by the fellow players . he later said on twitter he apologized to flipkens in person after the match .
the obstruction call that ended game 3 of the world###series on saturday offered a television lesson on how to correctly cover a critical play . fox did not let its cameras stray too long from the field , and was thus able to properly cover the dramatic end of the game . but in sunday 's game , fox committed a costly error on the game ending pickoff play . boston was ahead , 4 2 , with two outs in the bottom of the ninth . carlos beltran was at bat for st . louis and kolten###wong was the pinch###runner on first base . koji###uehara was trying to close out the game for the red###sox . with his team behind by two runs , wong was not expected to run , as tim###mccarver said . still , mike###napoli was holding him on . when the count went to 1 1 on beltran , fox continued to heighten the drama , as it does in postseason###games . the fox philosophy is that what goes on between pitches in late###innings is not riveting . so montages of anxious faces substitute for action . but the strategy contains an inherent risk if a director is not nimble enough , he may miss something . so , with the drama building , fox cut to the cardinals' dugout , then to a close up of beltran , a shot of matt###holliday waiting on deck , and finally to a nervous blond st . louis###fan holding her cardinals cap . fox lingered on the woman the network had shown her once before , with her cap on for a second or so too long . the result fox missed uehara 's pickoff throw , which ended the game and tied the world###series at . fox recovered with a low shot from the first base side of busch###stadium that hastily framed the shot of napoli slapping his tag on wong . the cut was late , bill webb , fox 's lead baseball director , said monday during a telephone interview from st . louis before game . i saw the play , but it was a late cut . he said that uehara had just gotten back on the mound when he threw to napoli . it was very quick , between pitches , not even a normal throw over , he added , noting that if he had not been late to show the pickoff move , it would have been shown from a high camera along the first base###line . i think he was shocked that he got wong . pete macheska , the coordinating producer of baseball for fox , said that the network would continue to cut to fans and players to heighten tension between pitches . baseball is n't the quickest sport , he said . if we stay on the field and do n't give all the reactions , it 's not as exciting as when we do . but do we aim to miss something ? no . the obstruction sequence in game 3 was handled with greater aplomb . the score was tied at , with one out , and the cardinals were batting in the bottom of the ninth . after allen###craig doubled , fox fixated on the next batter , jon###jay , and never left him to show the anxious faces of any nonessential personnel . after jay lifted a pop foul into the seats on the first pitch from uehera , fox stayed on him for 16 seconds a fox baseball epic ! before cutting to uehara for five seconds and the runner on third base , yadier###molina , for three . the final , multipart play was a classic shot from the high home###plate camera that panned and zoomed in and out to capture all of the play second baseman dustin###pedroia 's great throw home to get molina catcher jarrod###saltalamacchia 's errant throw to third baseman will middlebrooks craig falling over the splayed middlebrooks 's legs , which prompted the obstruction call , and craig being called safe at home although the throw beat him . you ca n't cut on that play , webb said . if you cut , you take attention from where the ball is . the first cut away was to a terrific close up of craig , on his belly , after sliding past home , looking tired and a bit bewildered . and , with each replay , the parts of the lengthy play came into focus , especially when the camera showed a slow###motion replay of middlebrooks 's legs flexing upward which impeded craig 's ability to run home . several of the replays showed the third base###umpire jim###joyce emphatically pointing at the base to indicate obstruction . webb said he thought joyce was a little far from the bag , but he was close enough to the play to have clearly been in fox 's frame . and joe###buck 's call of the play save for initially saying that it was interference was assured and exciting , and most important , he waited several seconds to be certain that the home###plate###umpire , dana demuth , had called craig safe .
wallops###island , va . ( ap ) a private company hired by nasa to make supply runs to the international###space###station scrubbed a wednesday test launch of an unmanned rocket , saying an important data cord linked to the rocket 's second stage detached too soon . the towering antares rocket had been scheduled to blast off wednesday###afternoon from wallops###island on virginia 's eastern###shore when the countdown clock was halted at the 12 minute###mark . barron beneski , a spokesman for dulles based orbital###sciences corp . , said another launch###attempt would be tried no sooner than friday###afternoon . orbital crews were expected to examine the rocket through the night to determine how the ethernet cable came loose . several other cables in the same area all remained attached to the rocket . orbital officials had said initially they suspected high###winds . the launch director for nasa 's wallops###flight###facility granted orbital permission to proceed with a launch as long as winds did n't exceed 23 mph , up from a 17 mph cap originally in place . at the time the cable separated , the winds were blowing less than 7 mph , said frank culbertson , executive###vice###president###and###general###manager of orbital 's advanced programs . they were really light , he said . you know , we do n't know if it was something blowing in the wind or a big sea gull . orbital officials had said low hanging cloud cover was a concern wednesday as a possible launch###window of several hours was shortened to just 10 minutes . culbertson said the initial weather###forecast did n't look good for another try friday but a decision was expected to be made thursday on the next attempt . the planned launch by the washington area commercial firm was designed to test whether a practice payload could reach###orbit and safely separate from the rocket . orbital executives have said the tests would prove their capability to carry out several supply runs they contracted for with nasa . orbital was one of two commercial###companies , along with california based competitor spacex , chosen to supply the space###station by nasa , which ended its three decade old shuttle program in . spacex , based in hawthorne , calif . , was awarded a.6 billion contract by nasa in 2006 to make a dozen restocking missions . spacex has linked up with the space###station three times . in , orbital jumped in and was awarded a.9 billion contract for eight deliveries . we 've been playing###catch up , but we 're about caught up , culbertson had said recently as test plans loomed . by the end of next year we should have an additional four or five cargo missions under our belt , so we 're going to be moving fast . if ultimately###successful in testing antares , orbital executives have said they hoped to launch a rocket this summer carrying its cygnus cargo###ship aloft to see whether it could safely dock with the space###station . orbital is under contract to eventually deliver about , 000 pounds of supplies to the space###station and envisions making about two deliveries per year . its cargo###ship would carry about , 400 pounds worth of supplies on its first three missions and , 600 pounds on its last five . unlike the spacex 's dragon capsule , which is capable of two way deliveries , the orbital cargo###ship is not designed to return with experiments or other items from the space###station . instead , orbital 's plans call for filling its cygnus ship with garbage to be incinerated with the craft upon re entering earth 's atmosphere . that 's also what russian , european and japanese cargo###ships do .
rio de janeiro almost , 000 confederations###cup tickets bought on the internet by brazilian fans have not been collected with only two days until the tournament starts , fifa 's general secretary said on thursday . jerome valcke told a news conference the development raised###concerns ahead of next year 's world###cup because brazilian supporters , who have complained about the system , are used to turning up on match day to buy###tickets before watching a game . the problem has been made worse by the reduced number of places to pick up tickets with only one in each confederations###cup host city except rio de janeiro which has three . huge queues formed over the last few days in a hotel in rio and some fans complained of having to wait for over two hours to get the tickets , even with prior appointment . according to fifa , world soccer 's governing###body , 234 , 000 tickets had not been collected by wednesday . it s good to have the confederations###cup so the brazilians can understand that they can t get the tickets on match day , and in the world###cup it will be even more important , valcke told a news conference on thursday . we need people to get used to buying###tickets and to get them in advance , he said . most people in brazil are used to going to the stadium at the last minute and buying their tickets . that cannot happen in the confederations###cup and , most importantly , in the world###cup , mainly for security reasons . a record for the confederations###cup of more than , 000 tickets have already been sold out of the , 000 available . we sold three times more tickets in brazil than in south###africa ( in . it 's a success , said valcke . the tournament starts on saturday with the opening###match between brazil and japan in brasilia . matches will also be staged in belo###horizonte , fortaleza , recife , salvador and rio .

only three l.p.g.a . tournaments remain before the united###states team is selected for this year 's solheim###cup , the biennial match###play competition between the top female###golfers from the united###states and europe . the final points event will be the women 's british###open , set for aug . 1 4 at the old course in st . andrews , scotland . the united###states and european teams will be announced after that 72 hole championship . this year 's solheim###cup , the 13th event , will be played aug . 16 18 at colorado golf###club in parker , colo . between now and the british###open , players will try to secure spots on their squads on merit , and the captains will plot their wild###card selections . the american captain , meg###mallon , said she was looking for a mix of strong###results and match###play chops . if a player is playing well and they have had that experience behind them , they are definitely at the top of my list , mallon said . heading into this week 's manulife###financial l.p.g.a . classic in waterloo , ontario , the americans' projected roster###includes a host of familiar###names . stacy###lewis , a two time winner on tour this year , leads the points ranking system , followed by paula###creamer , cristie###kerr , angela###stanford and brittany lincicome . the top eight players qualify###automatically , and jessica###korda , lexi###thompson and brittany###lang currently hold the last spots . korda and thompson will be solheim###cup rookies if they make the team . i 'm not worried about those two young###players , mallon said . they 've both won l.p.g.a . tournaments . but where it gets more interesting is filling out the remainder of the 12 player roster . the ninth and 10th spots will go to the players highest on the rolex world###rankings not already on the team , and mallon will choose the final two members . among those she will consider are the second year l.p.g.a . tour player lizette###salas , who is currently ninth on the points list , and the former solheim###cup player morgan###pressel , who is 10th . ( the world 's top ranked###player , inbee###park , who has won six tournaments this year and lives in nevada , is ineligible for the united###states team because she was born in south###korea . ) the european selection###process will choose four players through the solheim###cup points system ( operated through the ladies###european###tour , four top ranked###players from the world###rankings , and four players###selected by this year 's captain , liselotte###neumann . the current points leaders for the european teams are suzann###pettersen of norway , catriona###matthew of scotland , carlota###ciganda of spain and caroline###masson of germany . anna###nordqvist of sweden , the spaniards azahara munoz and beatriz###recari , and karine###icher of france round out europe 's current top eight . i get four captain 's picks , but i think that 's going to be tough , said neumann , who played on six solheim###cup teams . it 's going to be very , very close between some good players and there will be some new members on the european team . while the players in the top five spots for the united###states team can feel secure , the next three tournaments could turn into a battle among players hoping to move into the top eight . jennifer johnson , a winner on tour this year , is hovering in the 11th spot , just ahead of michelle###wie . three other former solheim###cup players nicole###castrale ( 15th , vicky###hurst ( 16th ) and natalie###gulbis ( 18th ) are just behind them in the top . it 's hard in those last few events , said mallon , who played on nine of the previous 12 united###states solheim###cup teams . as a player , all you 're thinking about is getting into the solheim###cup . but mallon is also pragmatic . if you 're not in the top eight , and you 're not in the top two qualifiers on the rolex world###rankings , you should n't###expect to be on the team , she said . that 's how i felt when i played . that is not to say that mallon would overlook a veteran like juli###inkster ( currently ranked 22nd ) for her team as a captain 's pick , just as neumann might covet the value of an experienced player like england 's laura###davies for her side . in addition to her l.p.g.a . tournament schedule , davies , 49 , has been playing tournaments on the ladies###european###tour to accumulate###points toward europe 's solheim###cup team . she is currently 22nd .

washington president###obama on monday plans to nominate anthony r . foxx , the mayor of charlotte , n.c. , to be the next secretary of transportation , choosing a rising young african###american from the south to balance out a cabinet criticized for a lack of diversity . mr . obama also appeared close to nominating penny###pritzker , a hotel magnate , longtime###friend and fund###raiser , as the next commerce secretary , and michael froman , his international###economics adviser , as the united###states trade representative , although neither nomination was scheduled to be announced on monday . the selections , all of which would require senate###confirmation , would help fill out mr . obama 's second term cabinet more than five months after his re election . consumed by fiscal clashes and legislative battles and delayed by painstaking vetting , mr . obama has been slow to finish assembling a team to carry him through the second half of his administration . word of mr . foxx 's nomination , confirmed on sunday by white###house officials who insisted on anonymity to discuss it before the formal###announcement , comes at a time when the president has been scrutinized for the demographic makeup of his circle . after drawing criticism that many of his initial second term national###security picks were men , mr . obama has named a succession of women and minorities to other top level posts . the issue provoked one of the laugh lines at the annual###dinner of the white###house###correspondents' association on saturday###night . mr . president , your hair is so white it could be a member of your cabinet , conan###o'brien joked . mr . foxx , who turns 42 on tuesday , has served as mayor for nearly four years . but just three weeks###ago , he announced that he would not seek###re###election this year because he wanted to spend more time with his family , including two children born after he joined the charlotte city###council in . i do not want to be a father who looks back and wishes i had spent more time with them , he said in a statement on april . mr . foxx , who was raised by a single mother and his grandparents , became the first black student###body###president at davidson###college and earned a law degree from new york###university . he worked as a lawyer for a private firm as well as for the house###judiciary###committee and the justice###department before returning to charlotte to begin his career as an elected politician . he has said that during his four years as mayor , he has turned around an economically afflicted city , adding , 000 jobs , making charlotte more hospitable to business and hosting the democratic###national###convention last year . while mr . foxx does not have a transportation background , he did work as mayor to extend a light###rail line , open another runway at the airport , complete a major highway widening , improve a major bridge and bring streetcars back to charlotte . he would be the second black member of the cabinet , joining attorney###general eric h . holder jr . he would succeed ray###lahood , a former republican congressman who led the transportation###department for four years and said in january that he would step down as soon as his successor was confirmed . the commerce job has been open for nearly a year since john e . bryson stepped down in june , citing medical reasons after a sequence of car###crashes . the deputy###secretary , rebecca m . blank , has filled in since then . ms . pritzker , an heiress to the hyatt###hotel fortune , has been in the wings for months as the likely candidate , but vetting her family 's wealth and intricate business ties evidently delayed the nomination . mr . froman , a former managing###director of citigroup and a law###school friend of mr . obama who serves as his deputy###national###security###adviser for international###economic###affairs , appears likely to be the new trade representative , a cabinet level post . ron###kirk , a former dallas mayor who had the job in the first term , stepped down last month he spent time with mr . obama during the president 's trip to dallas last week and played###golf with him over the weekend .
lead a state board declared yonkers to be in financial###crisis today and froze all hiring and discretionary###spending by its government . hours later , an appeals###court panel suspended the daily fines imposed on the city for its defiance of a federal desegregation order , giving it temporary relief from the threat of bankruptcy . a state board declared yonkers to be in financial###crisis today and froze all hiring and discretionary###spending by its government . hours later , an appeals###court panel suspended the daily fines imposed on the city for its defiance of a federal desegregation order , giving it temporary relief from the threat of bankruptcy . the three judge panel also suspended 500 a day fines against the four city councilmen who were found in contempt of court on aug . 2 after rejecting the housing plan ordered by a federal###judge , leonard b . sand , and it stayed his threat to imprison them thursday if they had still not reversed their vote . the full united###states court of appeals for the second circuit in manhattan will hear the city 's and councilmen 's appeal of the contempt ruling and fines on aug . 17 . had the fines not been suspended , the daily fine on the city , which began at 100 and doubled each day , would have been 12 , 800 today , for a cumulative###total of 25 , 500 . on aug . 17 , the daily fine would have been 3 , 276 , 800 . the councilmen 's fines were not doubled daily . freeze on hiring in the meantime , the state board , the emergency financial###control board , will carry out the resolution it approved today , 5 to 1 , blocking all pay###increases for the city 's 1 , 900 workers , imposing a hiring freeze and taking###control from the city government of all discretionary###spending , such as promotions and consultants' fees . the action also nullified 50 pending contracts totaling 2 . 4 million . it was the first time since the state legislature established the current control###board for yonkers in 1984 , when mismanagement had brought yonkers to the ede of bankruptcy , that the board had assumed full responsibility for the city 's fiscal moves . ''perhaps this will be a wake up call to the city###council as to the seriousness of their actions , '' said secretary of state gail s . shaffer , who is the chairwoman of the board . in a sweltering room in city###hall , ms . shaffer appealed to yonkers residents to put pressure on the four councilmen who voted on aug . 2 to reject a plan to scatter 800 middle income apartments through the city 's neighborhoods . 'let reason prevail' that 4 to 3 vote was widely seen as a response to residents' anger last january after the council , under similar threats from judge sand , approved the first phase of the desegregation plan , 200 low income units to be built on several sites in mainly white neighborhoods . ''as you ponder the future of your city , as america watches yonkers , you have the power to let reason prevail , '' ms . shaffer said . ''you have a responsiblity to yourself and to your city 's future to express your reasoned concern to the four people you elected who have brought you to this precipice today . '' after the fines were suspended , she said this would not affect the control###board 's approach to yonkers 's fiscal troubles . judge sand ruled in 1985 that yonkers , which , with 194 , 000 residents is new york 's fourth###largest city , had deliberately discriminated against blacks in housing and education over four decades , in part by placing nearly all public###housing in the southwest###corner of the city . a school desegregation plan has been in place for two years , but last winter the city 's continued###resistance to a housing desegregation plan led judge sand to threaten yonkers and its councilmen with fines . because the crippling fines were temporarily halted today , the city will not have to follow through with its preparations to lay off all city employees by aug . 21 , when the total fines would have surpassed the 63 . 8 million in cash the city has available . 'it gives us a week' ''this buys us time , '' said neil j . deluca , the interim city###manager and the only one on the seven member control###board to vote against the resolution today . ''it gives us a week for cooler heads to prevail . '' the vote was 5 to 1 because one member , dr . alice ilchman , the president of sarah###lawrence###college , was on vacation and not at the board meeting . the government will not be able to fill the 60 to 70 positions that are now vacant out of the municipal work force , and its plans to hire 28 police###officers at the end of the month must be scrapped . the resolution does permit the city to continue to pay for its defense in the eight year old lawsuit , which so far has cost 15 million in legal###fees . before the stay was issued today , it appeared that the four councilmen in contempt had planned to go to jail thursday and continue their defiance . councilman edward fagan , a conservative who had seemed ready last week to change his vote or resign , said jokingly to a colleague at city###hall ''what kind of prison is this , anyway ? '' mr . deluca , who said he voted against the control###board 's takeover because it alone would not have saved the city from bankruptcy , told###reporters that he would seek a settlement of the case by calling for negotiations among city , county and state officials , citizen###groups for and against the housing plan , the roman###catholic archdiocese of new york and the national###association for the advancement of colored people , which brought the suit against the city , along with the justice###department , in 1980 . but if the city and councilmen lose their appeal next week and the fines and threat of jail are reinstated , the pressure to approve the housing plan will be back on the council . 'a direct result' today , at the meeting of the financial###control board , ms . shaffer described the total###collapse of city services that would come if the council did not ''purge its contemptuous behavior . '' ''the prospect of no municipal###services whatsoever , '' she said . ''no policeman when you call for help , no firefighter when your house is burning , no garbage pickup as the trash piles up on your curb , no senior###citizen###services , no water as the tap runs dry can you reasonably accept these consequences which loom as a direct result of your city###council 's refusal to uphold the law ? '' the control###board will continue to oversee all of yonkers 's budgetary operations until the financial###crisis is over , which could be some time after the contempt ceases and the fines stop , ms . shaffer said . she also said that if the fines were reimposed after the appeal hearing next week , the councilmen could face criminal###prosecution for incurring the bankrupting fines . if the appeals###court rules in the city 's favor next week , all of the money paid in fines to date would be returned to the city and the councilmen , paul pickelle , the city 's corporation###counsel , said . a spending freeze is put on yonkers
boston the rangers were trailing by 3 2 and feeling pretty good about their chances when they came out for the third period sunday###afternoon . but 26 seconds into the period , boston 's brad###marchand got away from his defender and scored on a centering pass from patrice###bergeron . that easy goal essentially decided the game , and the bruins overwhelmed the rangers at the end for a second straight contest . we gave it to them , goalie henrik###lundqvist said quietly after the rangers lost , 5 2 , and fell into a 2 0 hole in their second round###playoff series . the rangers will go back to madison###square###garden for game 3 on tuesday . they faced the same deficit in the first round against washington before rallying to win , four games to three . but there have been more troubling signs in this series . for one thing , the rangers' defense broke down repeatedly against the bruins , and dan girardi , their top defenseman , struggled . he was the man who lost track of marchand on boston 's key third period goal . for another thing , marchand 's goal was almost a copy of his overtime###winner in game , also on a centering pass from bergeron . mats zuccarello was the ranger who lost track of marchand on that play , after the bruins dominated the rangers late in the third period and in overtime . in addition , the bruins have demonstrated they can finally score on lundqvist . before this series , he had played 31 games against boston and had not conceded more than three goals . the last time he gave up five goals to any team was on march , 2011 , at anaheim . lundqvist stopped 27 of 32 shots , surrendering goals to torey krug , gregory campbell , johnny###boychuk , marchand and milan###lucic . at the other end of the ice , boston goalie tuukka###rask stopped 35 of 37 shots and shut down a potent rangers attack . bruins fans say that rask was just as good as lundqvist this season , with a . 929 save###percentage to lundqvist 's . 926 . but lundqvist , not rask , is a finalist for the vezina###trophy . on sunday , the fans at td###garden chanted , lundqvist , lundqvist . i thought i was in position , but a couple screens , and when you give up five goals , you ca n't be satisfied , obviously , lundqvist said . you have to look at the way they scored###goals , too . it 's about teamwork out there , and today , it did n't really work for us . that much was true . the rangers moved the puck well on their five power plays but once again failed to score . they are 0 for 8 on the power play in this series and 2 for 36 in the postseason . coach john###tortorella even put carl###hagelin on the power play for two shifts , a total of 46 seconds , after saying saturday that he never used hagelin in those situations because he stinks on the power play . the rangers kept the game close for the first two periods . in the first , ryan###callahan made the score 1 1 just 2 minutes 33 seconds after krug opened the scoring , and in the second , rick###nash made it 2 2 just 56 seconds after campbell restored boston 's lead . nash went around the 6 foot 9 defenseman zdeno chara and shot to the top corner past rask . it was his first goal of the playoffs . but boychuk , a light scoring defenseman , gave the bruins a 3 2 lead at 08 of the second period , and rask shut down the rangers the rest of the way . there were plenty of two on ones , three on twos , and then a couple of turnovers from our d , rask said . i was just in front of the puck it was n't textbook all the time . but despite that goal from nash , i was just jumping . girardi said his error on marchand 's goal really put us behind the eight###ball . but he was encouraged by the rangers' strong second period , when they outshot boston by , and by the strength of a power play that produced seven shots , if no goals . we 're trying , girardi said . something 's got to give . we are getting shots , and it 's going to break here soon . now the rangers will have to trust their ability to come back . after the rangers dropped the first two games in washington , tortorella said they were closer to winning than most people thought , and he was right . on sunday , he was asked if the rangers were close after dropping the first two games in boston . listen , we do n't want to lose two games here , tortorella said . but there 's no give in this team . there will be no give in this team . henrik###lundqvist seemed to hurt himself sunday when he dived to cover a shot from daniel###paille with less than five minutes left . it 's my shoulder , he said . we 'll take a look at it .
houston conocophillips announced on wednesday that it was suspending its plans to drill in alaskan arctic waters in 2014 because of uncertainties over federal regulatory and permitting standards . the decision had been expected after last month 's announcement by the interior###department that shell oil company would have to provide a detailed###plan addressing numerous safety issues before it could resume its drilling###operations in alaska 's chukchi and beaufort seas . shell was forced to remove its two drilling###rigs from the area and send them to asia for repairs after a series of ship groundings , weather delays and environmental and safety###violations during the 2012 drilling season . shell , which has spent more than . 5 billion on its exploration###program , also called off its drilling###program for this year . while we are confident in our own expertise and ability to safely conduct offshore arctic operations , we believe that more time is needed to ensure that all regulatory stakeholders are aligned , trond erik johansen , president of conocophillips alaska , said in a statement . the statement cited a recent interior###department report calling on the oil industry and federal###government to coordinate efforts to develop standards for drilling , maritime###safety and emergency response systems and equipment for the arctic region . conocophillips said it welcomed working on that approach with the government before drilling . the company has 98 leases in the chukchi###sea 's outer###continental###shelf , a region that oil company geologists say has the potential to produce billions of barrels of oil in the coming###decades . once those requirements are understood , we will re evaluate our chukchi###sea drilling plans , mr . johansen said . environmentalists have long opposed drilling in arctic waters , arguing that it cannot be done safely because of powerful ice floes , winds and long###periods of darkness , and that it would disturb the habitats of many threatened###species including polar###bears . conocophillips has made a good choice , said michael levine , a lawyer for the environmental###group oceana . as we 've###learned again and again , operating in alaskan water demands preparation , care and attention to details companies have not yet proven able to provide . senator lisa###murkowski , an alaska republican who sits on the energy and natural###resources###committee , expressed###disappointment but said she understood that the decision was necessary . companies ca n't be expected to invest billions###of###dollars without some assurance that federal###regulators are not going to change the rules on them almost continuously , she said . the administration has created an unacceptable level of uncertainty when it comes to the rules of offshore exploration that must be fixed . the norwegian company statoil had already announced that it was putting off its plans to drill in the alaskan arctic waters from 2014 to . the interior###department 's review , completed in early###march , concluded that shell had failed in a broad range of operational and safety tasks , including the towing of one of the two drilling###rigs , which ran aground on an alaskan island on new year 's eve . david###lawrence , the executive###vice###president who was in charge of the alaska drilling###program , recently###left the company . the company said that the departure was by mutual###consent .
austin , tex . the central###presbyterian###church here turns into a concert###hall during the annual south###by###southwest###music###festival , and on a friday###afternoon in mid###march , natalie###maines of the dixie###chicks was doing her soundcheck there for a midnight show . it was an early steppingstone for her new solo career , a preview of songs from her debut###album , mother ( columbia , which is due for release this week . with mother , ms . maines puts a clear distance between herself and the buoyant , bluegrassy songs that made the dixie###chicks far and away the best selling female group in country###music . as a member of the dixie###chicks since she joined the group 's founding###members , martie###maguire and emily###robison , in , ms . maines has sold some 30 million###albums in the united###states alone . but after lying low in recent###years , ms . maines , 38 , makes her own statement with mother . she recorded it with the band led by ben###harper , a bluesy , socially###conscious songwriter and slide guitarist , and it 's darker and more pensive than her sassy public###image would have foretold . at the church , ms . maines' parents and a handful of onlookers watched as mr . harper and the band set up on an altar crowded with instruments and amps . one musician pointed toward the pulpit and joshingly asked ms . maines , would n't you be more comfortable there ? you 've already done that , tina maines , natalie 's mother , immediately chimed in . ms . maines flashed a rueful grin and agreed . i 've already done that , she said . the image of ms . maines preaching from a pulpit seemed to flash back to the remark that changed her life . on march , 2003 , shortly before the invasion of iraq , the dixie###chicks were performing in london when ms . maines spoke against the impending###war and added , just so you know , we 're ashamed that the president of the united###states is from texas . within days , conservative media###outlets branded the chicks as treasonous , and fearful country radio stations took their music off the air . although the dixie###chicks continued to tour , threats and protests met their concerts . the group eventually responded with its 2006 album , taking the long way , which included the defiant top 10 single , not ready to make nice , and was showered with grammy###awards . the dixie###chicks have continued to tour on and off and will be appearing at canadian festivals this summer . ms . maines has said she was reluctant to do this year 's shows but was outvoted by the rest of the band and its management . yet the dixie###chicks have not made a new studio###album since , and ms . maguire and ms . robison now write###songs for their own duo , the courtyard hounds . relations are amicable on may , the courtyard hounds , ms . maines and the dixie###chicks are all performing at a benefit###concert for the austin public television###station klru . since ms . maguire plays fiddle and ms . robison plays banjo , the courtyard hounds have stayed###close to country###music . but with mother , ms . maines has decisively left country behind . there 's a pressure of wanting to please other people and not let martie and emily down in particular , ms . maines said in an interview at an austin hotel . but there 's a point of feeling like i 'm almost 40 and i 'm just not going to do anything i do n't want to do any more . she was dressed in chicly understated graphite gray and has let her hair return from the blond of the dixie###chicks' heyday to its natural###light brown her short and upswept haircut , she said with a chuckle , is a lot like justin###bieber 's . she laughed easily , but her blue###eyes flashed as she recalled decade old wounds . there 's just no trust as far as the industry we were in , the country music###industry , she said . to do country###music right now would feel like too big a compromise i just ca n't do it . it took a lot of years for me to admit that to myself and definitely to admit it to them . between dixie###chicks tours , ms . maines became a homebody , gardening and raising her two sons ( with her husband , the actor adrian###pasdar . her public presence was largely limited to studio duets ( with tony###bennett and neil###diamond , appearances on satellite###radio and the television show of her friend howard###stern , and her unvarnished personal###twitter feed , where she wisecracks , offers stray daily details and sometimes snaps back at the political hostility she still receives . that twitter###account , she said , is going to get me in trouble . she deliberately has n't had twitter verify it as hers i can say , 'that 's not me . i do n't know who that crazy girl is saying those horrible###things . ' she laughed and added it really probably is people getting to see the truest part , the part that usually only people close really hear or see . i feel free to spit it out there . on march , she tweeted , good thing i 'm not a told ya so kind of person or i might point out that 10 years###ago today i said gwb was full of bull and i was right . clearly , she is unrepentant . i would never take it back , she said . i 'm so glad it happened . i feel like it sort of freed me in a lot of ways . i did n't know people were misinterpreting who i was as a person , or making all of these assumptions because of the kind of music i played . i have no problem being a pro gay , pro###choice , pro woman , pro free###speech kind of a person , and i have no shame in that or apology or embarrassment . i think i just felt very rebellious about it all . yeah , this is me . like it or hate it , i 'm not doing anything wrong . she was in no hurry to make her own album . i caught up on a lot of just domestic normal###everyday stuff , she said , and grew up a lot , and went to therapy , and did a lot of contemplating and figuring things out . i needed to just strip everything away and figure out who i am and get to know myself , as cheesy as that sounds .
